III. Decision
 

1. Findings related to the security of data management

 
Pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is science

its circumstances and purposes, as well as the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
appropriate technical and
implements organizational measures to ensure that the level of risk is appropriate

point, the systems and services used to manage personal data are continuous
ensuring its confidentiality.
 
According to Article 32 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, security is adequate
when determining the level of
risks, which are especially transmitted personal data to unauthorized public
they result from making or unauthorized access to them.
 
According to the Authority's opinion, the data processing affected by the incident, i.e. the members of the political party,
personal data of sympathizers and activists (e.g. identification data, contact details, with party
related activities) is considered high risk. This is because it is common
Recital (75) of the Data Protection Regulation refers to data management during which political
data that can be associated with an opinion is treated as fundamentally risky. With this
in this context, it also considers it risky if data management results in discrimination
may arise, and also if the data management covers a large number of stakeholders. Finally, such data
management, of which identity theft or identity abuse (such
in this case, the identification data in the tables, such as: name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, identity card number, Facebook profile link) may also be risky
considered by these provisions of the decree.

According to the Authority's opinion, a total of six items in the published table
the handling of the data of data subjects is considered high risk according to the General Data Protection Regulation
based on the above regulations. Individually, very easily, based on the range of data in the table
various tasks that sympathize with the party during its operation can become identifiable
the handling of the contact information of the parties involved together with the names and party affiliation
because of Violation of data confidentiality with high risks
involved parties
regarding his private sphere, since he belongs to a political organization - even if it may be from the past
- definitely reflects the political opinion of the given person.
 
Data relating to political opinion is Article 9 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
belong to a special category of personal data. The highlighting of these data is a
under the general concept of personal data, it is justified by the fact that such information is the data subject
they relate to more sensitive aspects of his life, therefore their disclosure is unauthorized
knowledge of it can be particularly harmful for the person concerned. This data is illegal
its treatment can negatively affect the individual's reputation, private and family life, it is disadvantageous
may be a cause or reason for discrimination against the person concerned.
 
Finally, the risks of data management are also increased by the fact that a large number of data subjects, more than 2,000, are personal
data were processed together in the tables.
 
The responsibility of the data controller, i.e. in this case the Customer, is to comply with Article 32 (1)-(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on paragraphs that based on the nature, circumstances, purposes and risks of data processing, a
according to the state of science and technology, implement appropriate level of data security measures
finally. Among other things, these data security measures must guarantee that a
managed personal data should preferably not be made public without authorization, or should not be related to them
can be accessed without authorization.
 
Based on the judgment of the Authority, identification data and political opinion that can be linked to the data subjects
management of reflective data within the framework of Google Sheets, a free online service
in the form in which it was realized in the present case, it does not meet the high risk
the level of data security commensurate with the risks presented by data management.
 
Google Sheets is a free, web-based spreadsheet program offered by Google
It is part of the Google Docs Editors package. The application allows users to
create and edit files online while collaborating with others in real time
with users. Modifications can be tracked by the user using the modification display
with version history. The position of the editor has an editor-specific color and cursor
highlighted, and an authorization system controls what users can do. THE
documents can be shared, opened and edited by several users at the same time. THE

Handling the large amount of special personal data contained in the tables is very difficult in itself
it entails serious risks for the privacy of those concerned. The Customer is the high risk
in connection with data management, access to the tables was granted to the party's leading officials and
for its activists with the help of a link, since according to the party's internal principles, the activists can also directly
they can keep in touch with each other. In this way, even thousands of stakeholders could access the tables
online at once with a simple link, without any other restrictions. Because Google
Users can simply export and save files from the Sheets online service
to your local computer, therefore such a large number of access any other authorization control (e.g
password access to the table) in the case of provision without, it is very likely that
the occurrence that even unauthorized persons have access to the data, or that
a person entitled to it in advance sends it to others as well, or brings them himself
public. Nor to apply encryption to preserve the confidentiality of files
took place.
 
Without the application of additional appropriate control measures, it cannot be done by science and
from the point of view of the state of technology, it is sufficient to guarantee that it is very loose
access
personal data handled under measures should not be exposed sooner or later
public. The present is an example of the consequences of the lack of stronger security measures
also a data protection incident in the case.
 
Only in connection with the analysis of the file access log, the Customer could not establish that
whether they were accessed by an unauthorized external attacker, or if the files were made public
is it the result of an internal leak.
 
In the opinion of the Authority, if the Client stores the files in some internal, appropriate way
with encryption and
next to protection
authorization management and internal logging) would have been handled in a system (e.g. dedicated server), so
the data protection incident that is the subject of the report was also much less likely to follow
and the circumstances of its occurrence would have been easier to reconstruct.
 
Based on the above, the Authority determines that the Client is appropriate and proportionate to the risks
data security
by data processing in the absence of measures, violated the general
Article 32, paragraph (1) and points a)-b) of the data protection regulation, as well as (2) of this article

2. Measures taken in connection with the handling of the data protection incident that occurred

 
Based on Article 4, point 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation, a data protection incident is considered a
breach of security, which is the unauthorized disclosure of the processed personal data or related to them
results in unauthorized access. From the point of view of the concept, it is the same as the security event
relationship can be considered a key element. An event involving personal data is only that
cases are considered data protection incidents if it can be caused by some kind of security breach
connected, this is the root cause and there is a causal connection between the two. The safety
damage may result from the security measures used to protect personal data
incomplete, inadequate, possibly out of date, or due to their complete absence.
 
In the given case, the security breach was caused by the Customer not using the appropriate equipment
technical and organizational measures regarding the data of party sympathizers

 

11

in order to preserve its confidentiality (see the provisions of point III/1 of the decision). Appropriate
in the absence of security measures, therefore also the personal data of supporters and members
containing tables, were removed from the
from its management and made public by unknown persons on the Internet.
 
According to Article 33 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a data protection incident is defined as
controller without undue delay and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after it is
becomes aware of a data protection incident, must report it to the supervisory authority. The incident
reporting can only be omitted if the incident probably does not involve risk a
regarding the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Assessing the risks associated with the incident
it is the responsibility of the data controller.
 
Sensitive and accurate data that is classified as special personal data involved in the incident
occurring during inclusive data management due to damage to security measures
a data protection incident is considered high risk. This is because of political activity
after the disclosure of the relevant data, the data controller's influence on their fate is complete
out of your control. Further confidentiality of the data management is not possible in full
guarantee in the future.
 
The client bears the risks related to their further fate due to the avoidance of data management
cannot take completely eliminating measures, the data – where appropriate illegal –
can no longer fully reduce the risks associated with its further treatment. The file sharing site
(in this case: https://ufile.io)'s subsequent request to delete the data reduces the
risks that the Customer took during incident management.
 
The Authority is also a factor that further increases the risks posed by the data protection incident
considers that access protection for the tables containing the special data of the data subjects (e.g.
could be accessed without a password), with just a link. Adequate data security
the application of measures would have reduced the risk of special data
third parties should not get to know me without authorization and they should not be made public.
 
The publication of the special data in comparison with the circumstances of the incident is the Authority
in his opinion, resulted in a high-risk data protection incident.
 
Based on the above, the Authority considers the data protection incident to be high risk
can be considered, therefore, if the data controller becomes aware of such a case, it must be reported

The Authority initiated an official inspection and then an official procedure in connection with the incident report
tried several times to inform the Customer about exactly what it was like
took measures to manage the incident and reduce the risks for those involved
however, despite the Customer's knowledge, he did not receive any answers regarding these.
 
Therefore, the customer did not prove to the Authority, despite repeated requests to provide data,
what exactly measures were taken in relation to the handling of the data protection incident
in order for the data management carried out by it to comply with the regulation from the point of view of the case
relevant regulations. Among other things, the Authority expected confirmation from the Client that it is
how did you transform the data management involved in the incident, so that in the future with the risks
apply proportionate data security measures to avoid a similar incident in the future
order (Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation), and that the persons concerned are subject to the high
in relation to a data protection incident with risk, how and with what content you were informed (general
Article 34 of the Data Protection Regulation).

Since the Client did not prove to the Authority that the regulation is relevant despite repeated requests
measures taken to comply with its regulations, and therefore violated the general

Extenuating circumstances:

that the affected parties would have suffered any specific disadvantage or damage as a result of the infringement.
[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)]

 

- The Authority took into account that the Client had not previously established the
violation of the law related to the management of personal data. [83 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

not because of its operation, but because of the reasons for choosing the technology
