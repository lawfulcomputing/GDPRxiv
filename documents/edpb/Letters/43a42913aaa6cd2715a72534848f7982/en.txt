Thank you for your letter of 22 March 2024 and for transmitting the six Consumer Profiling Reports 
(“the reports”) submitted by gatekeepers pursuant to Article 15 of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”). 
The EDPB takes note  that these reports are of a confidential nature and confirms that they will be 
treated as such.   
 
The EDPB is currently analysing the reports with a view of assessing the possible use of for purposes 
of  Regulation  2016/679  (“GDPR”),  and  in  particular  to  inform  the  enforcement  of  Union  data 
protection rules, as provided for by Article 36(3) and recital 72 DMA. 
 
The  EDPB  also  takes  note  of  the Commission’s  invitation  for  the  EDPB  to  provide  its  views  on  the 
content  of  the  reports  and  takes  note  that  the  Commission  would  consider  having  a  dedicated 
discussion on these reports during one of the next meetings of the DMA High Level Group (HLG).  
 
Cooperation with other regulatory authorities on matters with an impact on data protection is of great 
importance to the EDPB, and is a key pillar in the EDPB Strategy 2024-2027. The EDPB and its members 
look  forward  to  continue  cooperation  with  the  Commission  in  the  context  of  the  DMA  and  to 
contribute to the work of the DMA HLG.  
 
Yours sincerely,
