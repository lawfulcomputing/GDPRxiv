Subject:  Data Protection and Digital Information Bill - EDPB reply letter 

 

 Dear Mr Edwards  

Thank you for your letter of 1 March 2024 sharing information on the passage of the Data Protection 
and  Digital  Information  Bill  (“the  bill”)  as  it  enters  the  latter  stages  of  consideration  by  the  UK 
Parliament. 

The  European  Commission  is  responsible  for  negotiating  and  monitoring  adequacy  decisions.  The 
EDPB has been closely following the developments in the UK and receives regular updates from the 
European Commission.  

Should the European Commission decide to renew the UK adequacy decisions before the end of the 
sunset clause expiry date, then it should consult the EDPB for an Opinion in accordance with Article 
70(1)(s) GDPR. The EDPB is looking forward to contributing to the European Commission’s evaluation 
of the UK adequacy decisions. 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Anu Talus
