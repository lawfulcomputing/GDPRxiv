Dear Sir,  

Thank you for your letter of 17 March 2023 to the EDPB regarding the interplay between the GDPR 
and Directive 2014/65/EU (‘Directive MiFID II’).  

In your letter, you refer to questions raised in relation to the interplay between these two legislative 
texts in light of recommendations provided by the Czech National Bank.  

The  EDPB  appreciates  the  importance  of the  points  raised  by the  Czech  Association  Companies of 
Financial Advice in relation to  Article 16(6) and (7) of the Directive MiFID II, and is grateful for the 
provided analysis. However, while I understand the importance of seeking guidance on this matter, I 
would  like  to  clarify  that  the  EDPB  does  not  possess  the  same  competence,  tasks,  and  powers  as 
national  supervisory  authorities.  In  accordance  with  Article  70(1)(a)  GDPR,  the  EDPB’s  mission  to 
monitor and ensure the correct application of the GDPR is limited to the cases provided for in Articles 
64 and 65 GDPR.  

Conversely,  the  responsibility  for  addressing  compliance  with  data  protection  law  falls  under  the 
jurisdiction of the respective national data protection authorities (DPAs) in each EU member state. 
Given the implementation of MiFID II may vary across member states, I therefore encourage you to 
direct  you  request  to  the  Czech  Supervisory  Authority  competent  for  data  protection  (Úřad  pro 
ochranu osobních údajů), which will be in the best position to advise you on this matter. 

At the same time, I would like to reassure you that the EDPB remains concerned about the need to 
ensure a consistent application of the GDPR within the European Union, including with regard to the 
interplay with MiFID II, and, in this context, thank you for bringing these matters to my attention. 

 
Yours sincerely, 

 Anu Talus
