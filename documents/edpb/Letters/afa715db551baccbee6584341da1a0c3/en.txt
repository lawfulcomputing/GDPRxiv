Subject: Your letter to the EDPB of 9 November 2022 
 

Dear Mr Körner, 

 

Mr Moritz Körner 
Member of the European Parliament 

Brussels, 15 December 2023 
 

Thank you for your letter of 9 November 2022 which contained your questions about the ‘Do Not 
Track’ function in Internet browsers and the related use of Article 21(5) GDPR. In this letter, we will 
also refer to the equivalent provision under Article 23(3) Regulation 2018/1725. 

As a preface to our answer, the EDPB recalls that, under Article 5(3) Directive 2002/58/EC (‘ePrivacy 
Directive’) and in line with the CJEU’s judgment in C-673/17 Planet49 GmbH, a website operator is 
only permitted to use cookies that are not strictly necessary (including those used for tracking) where 
the user has actively consented to their use. The concept of consent is defined under the Article 4(11) 
GDPR and requires a ‘freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of a data subject’s 
wishes’. These elements have also been interpreted by, inter alia, the EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on 
consent1. The EDPB also notes that, should a data subject wish to withhold their consent, there is no 
legal requirement for the data subject to ‘object’ to the request per se; rather, in such cases, the data 
subject simply does not provide their consent. Equally, Article 7(3) GDPR notes that data subjects ‘shall 
have the right to withdraw [their] consent at any time’ [emphasis added]. If, therefore, a data subject 
had  previously  given  their  consent  but  has  now  changed  their  mind,  this  would  be  effected  by 
withdrawing that consent and not through an objection to the processing under Article 21(1) GDPR. 

The EDPB further recalls that the material scope of the right to object is set out by Article 21(1) and (2) 
GDPR. Of these provisions, Article 21(1) GDPR only applies to processing which is necessary for the 
performance  of  a  task  carried  out  in  the  public  interest  under  the  Article  (6)(1)(e)  GDPR  or  to 
processing  which  is  necessary  for  a  legitimate  interest  under  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR.  Meanwhile, 
Article 21(2) GDPR is focused on processing performed for the purposes of direct marketing.  

                                                           
1 EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679, version 1.1 adopted on 4 May 2020,

While Article 21(5) GDPR may, therefore, be relevant to certain tracking activities, the EDPB notes that 
this provision should not be read as imposing a general requirement that website operator respect a 
user’s Do Not Track settings. Further, a website operator wishing to use cookies which are not strictly 
necessary (including tracking cookies) should still take the required steps to actively obtain consent 
from users whose Do Not Track flag is set to permit tracking.  

Regarding  enforcement  actions,  the  EDPB  is  aware  that  some  complaints  have  been  dealt  with 
regarding websites’ failure to respect Do Not Track signals. However, these have been dealt with as 
part of allegations of no or invalid consent, rather than under Article 21(5) GDPR or Article 23(3) 
Regulation  2018/1725,  and  the  EDPB  is  not  aware  of  any  enforcement  actions  under  either 
Article 21(5) GDPR or Article 23(3) Regulation 2018/1725 which relate to the Do Not Track function in 
Internet browsers per se. In this context, the EDPB also emphasises the importance of Article 5(3) 
ePrivacy Directive and notes the importance of the elements discussed above for future approaches 
to enforcement. Nevertheless, it is important to note that some supervisory authorities do encourage 
controllers to respect Do Not Track flags, and the European Data Protection Supervisor noted that 
respecting  such  flags,  when  set  to  not  permit  tracking,  was  a  requirement  for  websites  of  EU 
Institutions and Bodies. 

Finally, the EDPB would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the protection of 
data subject rights. Thank you again for your letter and the EDPB sends its apologies for the delay in 
our response.  
 
Yours sincerely,
