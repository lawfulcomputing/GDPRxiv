Dear Sir or Madam,  

 

European Payments Council AISBL 
Cours Saint-Michel 30

Brussels, 30 November 2023 

I would like to thank you for your letter dated 28 February 2023, in which you sought advice from the 
EDPB regarding the sharing of personal data within a platform dedicated to threat intelligence and 
fraud-related information pertaining to payments. 

In this respect, allow me first to reiterate that the EDPB has the general responsibility of ensuring the 
consistent application of the GDPR under Article 70(1) GDPR. In pursuit of this objective, the EDPB has 
previously issued Guidelines on the interplay between the GDPR and the revised Payment Services 
Directive (PSD2)1.  

The EDPB has, in these Guidelines, provided its perspective that processing activities for the purpose 
of fraud prevention should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the data controller, in accordance 
with the principle of accountability2. In this regard, the EDPB would like to underscore that while the 
processing of personal data necessary for fraud prevention may be considered a legitimate interest of 
the payment service provider, the sharing of such personal data pertaining to fraud must be strictly 
limited and be provided by a clear and specific legal framework. 

In this context, however, national data protection authorities (DPAs), in line with their responsibilities 
to promote awareness among controllers and processors of their obligations under the GDPR as stated 
in  Article  57(1)(d)  GDPR,  are  best  placed  to  provide  payment  service  providers  with  additional 
information  and  clarifications  on  the  practical  implementation  of  the  aforementioned  Guidelines. 
Hence, we encourage you to reach out to your competent national DPA should you require further 
guidance.

Finally, I would like to assure you that the EDPB remains committed to ensuring continued efforts for 
a  consistent  interpretation  of  the  GDPR  including  in  the  context  of  its  interplay  with  PSD2,  and  is 
dedicated to extending these efforts to the new legislative proposal on PSD3. 

Yours sincerely, 

Anu Talus
