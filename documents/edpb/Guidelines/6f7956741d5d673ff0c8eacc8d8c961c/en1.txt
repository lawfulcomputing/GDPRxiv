Introduction 
 

 

1. 

 
2. 

These guidelines provide practical guidance and interpretative assistance from the Article 29 
Working Party (WP29) on the new obligation of transparency concerning the processing of 
personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation1 (the “GDPR”). Transparency is 
an overarching obligation under the GDPR applying to three central areas: (1) the provision 
of  information  to  data  subjects  related  to  fair  processing;  (2)  how  data  controllers 
communicate with data subjects in relation to their rights under the GDPR; and (3) how data 
controllers facilitate the exercise by data subjects of their rights2. Insofar as compliance with 
transparency is required in relation to data processing under Directive (EU) 2016/6803, these 
guidelines  also  apply  to  the  interpretation  of  that  principle.4  These  guidelines  are,  like  all 
WP29 guidelines, intended to be generally applicable and relevant to controllers irrespective 
of the sectoral, industry or regulatory specifications particular to any given data controller. 
As such, these guidelines cannot address the nuances and many variables which may arise in 
the context of the transparency obligations of a specific sector, industry or regulated area. 
However, these guidelines are intended to enable controllers to understand, at a high level, 
WP29’s interpretation of what the transparency obligations entail in practice and to indicate 
the  approach  which  WP29  considers  controllers  should  take  to  being  transparent  while 
embedding fairness and accountability into their transparency measures. 

Transparency is a long established feature of the law of the EU5. It is about engendering trust 
in the processes which affect the citizen by enabling them to understand, and if necessary, 
challenge those processes. It is also an expression of the principle of fairness in relation to the 

                                                           
1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural 
persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 
95/46/EC.  
2  These  guidelines  set  out  general  principles  in  relation  to  the  exercise  of  data  subjects’  rights  rather  than  considering 
specific modalities for each of the individual data subject rights under the GDPR. 
3 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons 
with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, 
detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, 
and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA 
4 While transparency is not one of the principles relating to processing of personal data set out in Article 4 of Directive (EU) 
2016/680, Recital 26 states that any processing of personal data must be “lawful, fair and transparent” in relation to the 
natural persons concerned. 
5 Article 1 of the TEU refers to decisions being taken “as openly as possible and as close to the citizen as possible”; Article 11(2) 
states that “The institutions shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil 
society”;  and  Article  15  of  the  TFEU  refers  amongst  other  things  to  citizens  of  the  Union  having  a  right  of  access  to 
documents of Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the requirements of those Union institutions, bodies, 
offices and agencies to ensure that their proceedings are transparent.

processing of personal data expressed in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of 
the European Union. Under the GDPR (Article 5(1)(a)6), in addition to the requirements that 
data must be processed lawfully and fairly, transparency is now included as a fundamental 
aspect  of  these  principles.7  Transparency  is  intrinsically  linked  to  fairness  and  the  new 
principle of accountability under the GDPR. It also follows from Article 5.2 that the controller 
must  always  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  personal  data  are  processed  in  a  transparent 
manner  in  relation  to  the  data  subject.8    Connected  to  this,  the  accountability  principle 
requires  transparency  of  processing  operations  in  order  that  data  controllers  are  able  to 
demonstrate compliance with their obligations under the GDPR9.  
 
In accordance with Recital 171 of the GDPR, where processing is already under way prior to 
25  May  2018,  a  data  controller  should  ensure  that  it  is  compliant  with  its  transparency 
obligations as of 25 May 2018 (along with all other obligations under the GDPR). This means 
that  prior  to  25  May  2018,  data  controllers  should  revisit  all  information  provided  to  data 
subjects on processing of their personal data (for example in privacy statements/ notices etc.) 
to  ensure  that  they  adhere  to  the  requirements  in  relation  to  transparency  which  are 
discussed  in  these  guidelines.  Where  changes  or  additions  are  made  to  such  information, 
controllers should make it clear to data subjects that these changes have been effected in 
order  to  comply  with  the  GDPR.  WP29  recommends  that  such  changes  or  additions  be 
actively brought to the attention of data subjects but at a minimum controllers should make 
this  information  publically  available  (e.g.  on  their  website).  However,  if  the  changes  or 
additions  are  material  or  substantive,  then  in  line  with  paragraphs  29  to  32  below,  such 
changes should be actively brought to the attention of the data subject. 
 
Transparency, when adhered to by data controllers, empowers data subjects to hold data 
controllers and processors accountable and to exercise control over their personal data by, 
for  example,  providing  or  withdrawing  informed  consent  and  actioning  their  data  subject 
rights10. The concept of transparency in the GDPR is user-centric rather than legalistic and is 
realised  by  way  of  specific  practical  requirements  on  data  controllers  and  processors  in  a 
number of articles. The practical (information) requirements are outlined in Articles 12 - 14 of 
the GDPR. However, the quality, accessibility and comprehensibility of the information is as 
important as the actual content of the transparency information, which must be provided to 
data subjects.

6 “Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject”. 
7 In Directive 95/46/EC, transparency was only alluded to in Recital 38 by way of a requirement for processing of data to be 
fair, but not expressly referenced in the equivalent Article 6(1)(a).  
8 Article 5.2 of the GDPR obliges a data controller to  demonstrate transparency (together with the five other principles 
relating to data processing set out in Article 5.1) under the principle of accountability. 
9  The  obligation  upon  data  controllers  to  implement  technical  and  organisational  measures  to  ensure  and  be  able  to 
demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR is set out in Article 24.1. 
10See, for example, the Opinion of Advocate General Cruz Villalon (9 July 2015) in the Bara case (Case C-201/14) at paragraph 
74: “the requirement to inform the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, which guarantees transparency of 
all processing, is all the more important since it affects the exercise by the data subjects of their right of access to the data being 
processed, referred to in Article 12 of Directive 95/46, and their right to object to the processing of those data, set out in Article 14 
of that directive”.

The  transparency  requirements  in  the  GDPR  apply  irrespective  of  the  legal  basis  for 
processing and throughout the life cycle of processing. This is clear from  Article 12 which 
provides that transparency applies at the following stages of the data processing cycle:  
 
 

before or at the start of the data processing cycle, i.e. when the personal data is being 
collected either from the data subject or otherwise obtained;  
throughout  the  whole  processing  period,  i.e.  when  communicating  with  data 
subjects about their rights; and  
at specific points while processing is ongoing, for example when data breaches occur 
or in the case of material changes to the processing.

The meaning of transparency 
 
6. 

Transparency  is  not  defined  in  the  GDPR.  Recital  39  of  the  GDPR  is  informative  as  to  the 
meaning and effect of the principle of transparency in the context of data processing: 
 

“It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are 
collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data 
are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and 
communication relating to  the processing of those personal data be easily accessible 
and  easy  to  understand,  and  that  clear  and  plain  language  be  used.  That  principle 
concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller 
and  the  purposes  of  the  processing  and  further  information  to  ensure  fair  and 
transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to 
obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are 
being processed…” 

Elements of transparency under the GDPR 
 
7. 

The key articles in relation to transparency in the GDPR, as they apply to the rights of the 
data  subject,  are  found  in  Chapter  III  (Rights  of  the  Data  Subject).  Article  12  sets  out  the 
general rules which apply to: the provision of information to data subjects (under Articles 13 
-  14);  communications  with  data  subjects  concerning  the  exercise  of  their  rights  (under 
Articles 15 - 22); and communications in relation to data breaches (Article 34). In particular 
Article 12 requires that the information or communication in question must comply with the 
following rules:  
 
 

it must be concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible (Article 12.1); 
clear and plain language must be used (Article 12.1); 
the  requirement  for  clear  and  plain  language  is  of  particular  importance  when 
providing information to children (Article 12.1); 
it  must  be  in  writing  “or  by  other  means,  including  where  appropriate,  by  electronic 
means” (Article 12.1);  
where requested by the data subject it may be provided orally (Article 12.1) ; and

 

it generally must be provided free of charge (Article 12.5). 
 

“Concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible” 
 
The requirement that the provision of information to, and communication with, data subjects 
is done in a “concise and transparent” manner means that data controllers should present the 
information/ communication efficiently and succinctly in order to avoid information fatigue. 
This information should be clearly differentiated from other non-privacy related information 
such  as  contractual  provisions  or  general  terms  of  use.  In  an  online  context,  the  use  of  a 
layered  privacy  statement/  notice  will  enable  a  data  subject  to  navigate  to  the  particular 
section of the privacy statement/ notice which they want to immediately access rather than 
having to scroll through large amounts of text searching for particular issues. 
 
The requirement that information is “intelligible” means that it should be understood by an 
average member of the intended audience. Intelligibility is closely linked to the requirement 
to use clear and plain language. An accountable data controller will have knowledge about 
the people they collect information about and it can use this knowledge to determine what 
that audience would likely understand. For example, a controller collecting the personal data 
of working professionals can assume its audience has a higher level of understanding than a 
controller that obtains the personal data of children. If controllers are uncertain about the 
level of intelligibility and transparency of the information and effectiveness of user interfaces/ 
notices/  policies  etc.,  they  can  test  these,  for  example,  through  mechanisms  such  as  user 
panels,  readability  testing,  formal  and  informal  interactions  and  dialogue  with  industry 
groups,  consumer  advocacy  groups  and  regulatory  bodies,  where  appropriate,  amongst 
other things. 
 
A central consideration of the principle of transparency outlined in these provisions is that 
the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences 
of the processing entails and that they should not be taken by surprise at a later point about 
the ways in which their personal data has been used. This is also an important aspect of the 
principle of fairness under Article 5.1 of the GDPR and indeed is linked to Recital 39 which 
states that “[n]atural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in 
relation  to  the  processing  of  personal  data...”  In  particular,  for  complex,  technical  or 
unexpected  data  processing,  WP29’s  position  is  that,  as  well  as  providing  the  prescribed 
information under Articles 13 and 14 (dealt with later in these guidelines), controllers should 
also separately spell out in unambiguous language what the most important consequences of 
the  processing  will  be:  in  other  words,  what  kind  of  effect  will  the  specific  processing 
described in a privacy statement/ notice actually have on a data subject? In accordance with 
the  principle  of  accountability  and  in  line  with  Recital  39,  data  controllers  should  assess 
whether there are particular risks for natural persons involved in this type of processing which 
should be brought to the attention of data subjects. This can help to provide an overview of 
the types of processing that could have the highest impact on the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of data subjects in relation to the protection of their personal data.

11. 

The “easily accessible” element means that the data subject should not have to seek out the 
information; it should be immediately apparent to them where and how this information can 
be accessed, for example by providing it directly to them, by linking them to it, by clearly 
signposting it or as an answer to a natural language question (for example in an online layered 
privacy statement/ notice, in FAQs, by way of contextual pop-ups which activate when a data 
subject fills in an online form, or in an interactive digital context through a chatbot interface, 
etc. These mechanisms are further considered below, including at paragraphs 33 to 40). 
 

Example 
 
Every organisation that maintains a website should publish a privacy statement/ notice on 
the website. A direct link to this privacy statement/ notice should be clearly visible on each 
page of this website under a commonly used term (such as “Privacy”, “Privacy Policy” or 
“Data  Protection  Notice”).  Positioning  or  colour  schemes  that  make  a  text  or  link  less 
noticeable, or hard to find on a webpage, are not considered easily accessible. 
 
For apps, the necessary information should also be made available from an online store 
prior  to  download.  Once  the  app  is  installed,  the  information  still  needs  to  be  easily 
accessible from within the app. One way to meet this requirement is to ensure that the 
information  is  never  more  than  “two  taps  away”  (e.g.  by  including  a  “Privacy”/  “Data 
Protection”  option  in  the  menu  functionality  of  the  app).  Additionally,  the  privacy 
information in question should be specific to the particular app and should not merely be 
the generic privacy policy of the company that owns the app or makes it available to the 
public. 
 
WP29 recommends as a best practice that at the point of collection of the personal data in 
an online context a link to the privacy statement/ notice is provided or that this information 
is made available on the same page on which the personal data is collected. 
 

 

12. 

“Clear and plain language”    
 
With  written  information  (and  where  written  information  is  delivered  orally,  or  by  audio/ 
audiovisual  methods,  including  for  vision-impaired  data  subjects),  best  practices  for  clear 
writing  should  be  followed.11  A  similar  language  requirement  (for  “plain,  intelligible 
language”) has previously been used by the EU legislator12 and is also explicitly referred to in 
the  context  of  consent  in  Recital  42  of  the  GDPR13.  The  requirement  for  clear  and  plain 
language  means  that  information  should  be  provided  in  as  simple  a  manner  as  possible, 
avoiding complex sentence and language structures. The information should be concrete and 
definitive; it should not be phrased in abstract or ambivalent terms or leave room for different

and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms.

interpretations. In particular the purposes of, and legal basis for, processing the personal data 
should be clear.  
 

Poor Practice Examples 
 
The following phrases are not sufficiently clear as to the purposes of processing: 
 

 

 

 

“We may use your personal data to develop new services” (as it is unclear what 
the “services” are or how the data will help develop them); 

“We may use your personal data for research purposes (as it is unclear what kind 
of “research” this refers to); and 

 

 

 

“We may use your personal data to offer personalised services” (as it is unclear 
what the “personalisation” entails). 

Good Practice Examples14 
 

 

 
 

 

“We  will  retain  your  shopping  history  and  use  details  of  the  products  you  have 
previously purchased to make suggestions to you for other products which we believe 
you will also be interested in ” (it is clear that what types of data will be processed, 
that the data subject will be subject to targeted advertisements for products and 
that their data will be used to enable this); 

“We will retain and evaluate information on  your recent visits to our website and how 
you  move  around  different  sections  of  our  website  for  analytics  purposes  to 
understand how people use our website so that we can make it more intuitive” (it is 
clear  what  type  of  data  will  be  processed  and  the  type  of  analysis  which  the 
controller is going to undertake); and 
 
“We will keep a record of the articles on our website that you have clicked on and use 
that information to target advertising on this website to you that is relevant to your 
interests, which we have identified based on articles you have read” (it is clear what 
the  personalisation  entails  and  how  the  interests  attributed  to  the  data  subject 
have been identified). 
 

 
13. 

Language qualifiers such as “may”, “might”, “some”, “often” and “possible” should also be 
avoided.  Where  data  controllers  opt  to  use  indefinite  language,  they  should  be  able,  in 
accordance with the principle of accountability, to demonstrate why the use of such language 
could not be avoided and how it does not undermine the fairness of processing. Paragraphs 
and sentences should be well structured, utilising bullets and indents to signal hierarchical 

                                                           
14 The requirement for transparency exists entirely independently of the requirement upon data controllers to ensure that 
there is an appropriate legal basis for the processing under Article 6.

relationships. Writing should be in the active instead of the passive form and excess nouns 
should  be  avoided.  The  information  provided  to  a  data  subject  should  not  contain  overly 
legalistic,  technical  or  specialist  language  or  terminology.  Where  the  information  is 
translated into one or more other languages, the data controller should ensure that all the 
translations are accurate and that the phraseology and syntax makes sense in the second 
language(s) so that the translated text does not have to be deciphered or re-interpreted. (A 
translation in one or more other languages should be provided where the controller targets15 
data subjects speaking those languages.) 

 

Providing information to children and other vulnerable people 
 

15. 

14.  Where a data controller is targeting children16 or is, or should be, aware that their goods/ 
services are particularly utilised by children (including where the controller is relying on the 
consent of the child)17, it should ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language 
used  is  appropriate  to  and  resonates  with  children  so  that  the  child  addressee  of  the 
information recognises that the message/ information is being directed at them.18 A useful 
example of child-centred language used as an alternative to the original legal language can 
be found in the “UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Child Friendly Language”.19  
 
WP29’s  position  is  that  transparency  is  a  free-standing  right  which  applies  as  much  to 
children as it does to adults. WP29 emphasises in particular that children do not lose their 
rights as data subjects to transparency simply because consent has been given/ authorised 
by the holder of parental responsibility in a situation to which Article 8 of the GDPR applies. 
While  such  consent  will,  in  many  cases,  be  given  or  authorised  on  a  once-off basis  by  the 
holder of parental responsibility, a child (like any other data subject) has an ongoing right to 
transparency throughout the continuum of their engagement with a data controller. This is 
consistent with Article 13 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that 
a  child  has  a  right  to  freedom  of  expression  which  includes  the  right  to  seek,  receive  and 
impart information and ideas of all kinds.20 It is important to point out that, while providing 
for consent to be given on behalf of a child when under a particular age,21 Article 8 does not 
provide for transparency measures to be directed at the holder of parental responsibility who 

                                                           
15 For example, where the controller operates a website in the language in question and/or offers specific country options 
and/or  facilitates  the  payment  for  goods  or  services  in  the  currency  of  a  particular  member  state  then  these  may  be 
indicative of a data controller targeting data subjects of a particular member state. 
16 The term “child” is not defined under the GDPR, however WP29 recognises that, in accordance with the UN Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, which all EU Member States have ratified, a child is a person under the age of 18 years. 
17 i.e. children of 16 years or older (or, where in accordance with Article 8.1 of the GDPR Member State national law has set 
the  age  of  consent  at  a  specific  age  between  13  and  16  years  for  children  to  consent  to  an  offer  for  the  provision  of 
information society services, children who meet that national age of consent).  
18 Recital 38 states that “Children merit special protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of 
the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data”. Recital 
58  states  that  “Given  that  children  merit  specific  protection,  any  information  and  communication,  where  processing  is 
addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand”.

20  Article  13  of  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  states  that:  “The  child  shall  have  the  right  to  freedom  of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to  seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child’s choice.”

gives  such  consent.  Therefore,  data  controllers  have  an  obligation  in  accordance  with  the 
specific mentions of transparency measures addressed to children in Article 12.1 (supported 
by Recitals 38 and 58) to ensure that where they target children or are aware that their goods 
or  services  are  particularly  utilised  by  children  of  a  literate  age,  that  any  information  and 
communication should be conveyed in clear and plain language or in a medium that children 
can easily understand. For the avoidance of doubt however, WP29 recognises that with very 
young or pre-literate children, transparency measures may also be addressed to holders of 
parental responsibility given that such children will, in most cases, be unlikely to understand 
even the most basic written or non-written messages concerning transparency. 
 
Equally, if a data controller is aware that their goods/ services are availed of by (or targeted 
at) other vulnerable members of society, including people with disabilities or people who may 
have  difficulties  accessing  information,  the vulnerabilities  of  such  data  subjects  should  be 
taken into account by the data controller in its assessment of how to ensure that it complies 
with its transparency obligations in relation to such data subjects.22 This relates to the need 
for a data controller to assess its audience’s likely level of understanding, as discussed above 
at paragraph 9. 

 

“In writing or by other means” 

  
Under  Article  12.1,  the  default  position  for  the  provision  of 
information  to,  or 
communications with, data subjects is that the information is in writing.23 (Article 12.7 also 
provides for information to be provided in combination with standardised icons and this issue 
is considered in the section on visualisation tools at paragraphs 49 to 53).  However, the GDPR 
also  allows  for  other,  unspecified  “means”  including  electronic  means  to  be used.  WP29’s 
position with regard to written electronic means is that where a data controller maintains (or 
operates, in part or in full, through) a website, WP29 recommends the use of layered privacy 
statements/  notices,  which  allow  website  visitors  to  navigate  to  particular  aspects  of  the 
relevant privacy statement/ notice that are of most interest to them (see more on layered 
privacy statements/ notices at paragraph 35 to 37).24 However, the entirety of the information 
addressed  to  data  subjects  should  also  be  available  to  them  in  one  single  place  or  one 
complete document (whether in a digital or paper format) which can be easily accessed by a 
data subject should they wish to consult the entirety of the information addressed to them. 
Importantly, the use of a layered approach is not confined only to written electronic means 
for providing information to data subjects. As discussed at paragraphs 35 to 36 and 38 below, 
a layered approach to the provision of information to data subjects may also be utilised by 
employing a combination of methods to ensure transparency in relation to processing.  
 

                                                           
22 For example, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires that appropriate forms of assistance 
and support are provided to persons with disabilities to ensure their access to information. 
23 Article 12.1 refers to “language” and states that the information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, 
where appropriate, by electronic means. 
24 The WP29’s recognition of the benefits of layered notices has already been noted in Opinion 10/2004 on More Harmonised 
Information Provisions and Opinion 02/2013 on apps on smart devices.

Of  course,  the  use  of  digital  layered  privacy  statements/  notices  is  not  the  only  written 
electronic means that can be deployed by controllers. Other electronic means include “just-
in-time” contextual pop-up notices, 3D touch or hover-over notices, and privacy dashboards. 
Non-written electronic means which may be used in addition to a layered privacy statement/ 
notice might include videos and smartphone or IoT voice alerts.25 “Other means”, which are 
not necessarily electronic, might include, for example, cartoons, infographics or flowcharts. 
Where  transparency  information  is  directed  at  children  specifically,  controllers  should 
consider what types of measures may be particularly accessible to children (e.g. these might 
be comics/ cartoons, pictograms, animations, etc. amongst other measures). 
 
It is critical that the method(s) chosen to provide the information is/are appropriate to the 
particular  circumstances,  i.e.  the  manner  in  which  the  data  controller  and  data  subject 
interact or the manner in which the data subject’s information is collected. For example, only 
providing the information in electronic written format, such as in an online privacy statement/ 
notice may not be appropriate/ workable where a device that captures personal data does 
not have a screen (e.g. IoT devices/ smart devices) to access the website/ display such written 
information. In such cases, appropriate alternative additional means should be considered, 
for  example  providing  the  privacy  statement/  notice  in  hard  copy  instruction  manuals  or 
providing the URL website address (i.e. the specific page on the website) at which the online 
privacy  statement/  notice  can  be  found  in  the  hard copy  instructions  or  in  the  packaging. 
Audio (oral) delivery of the information could also be additionally provided if the screenless 
device  has  audio  capabilities.  WP29  has  previously  made  recommendations  around 
transparency  and  provision  of  information  to  data  subjects  in  its  Opinion  on  Recent 
Developments in the Internet of Things26 (such as the use of QR codes printed on internet of 
things  objects,  so  that  when  scanned,  the  QR  code  will  display  the  required  transparency 
information). These recommendations remain applicable under the GDPR. 

“..the information may be provided orally” 
 
Article  12.1  specifically  contemplates  that  information  may  be  provided  orally  to  a  data 
subject on request, provided that their identity is proven by other means. In other words, the 
means employed should be more than reliance on a mere assertion by the individual that they 
are  a  specific  named  person  and  the  means  should  enable  the  controller  to  verify  a  data 
subject’s identity with sufficient assurance. The requirement to verify the identity of the data 
subject  before  providing  information  orally  only  applies  to  information  relating  to  the 
exercise  by  a  specific  data  subject  of  their  rights  under  Articles  15  to  22  and  34.  This 
precondition  to the provision  of  oral  information  cannot  apply  to  the  provision  of  general 
privacy information as outlined in Articles 13 and 14, since information required under Articles 
13 and 14 must also be made accessible to  future users/ customers (whose identity a data 
controller  would  not  be  in  a  position  to  verify).  Hence,  information  to  be  provided  under 

                                                           
25 These examples of electronic means are indicative only and data controllers may develop new innovative methods to 
comply with Article 12. 
26 WP29 Opinion 8/2014 adopted on 16 September 2014

22. 

Articles  13  and  14  may  be  provided  by  oral  means  without  the  controller  requiring  a  data 
subject’s identity to be proven. 
  
The oral provision of information required under Articles 13 and 14 does not necessarily mean 
oral  information  provided  on  a  person-to-person  basis  (i.e.  in  person  or  by  telephone). 
Automated oral information may be provided in addition to written means. For example, this 
may  apply  in  the  context  of  persons  who  are  visually  impaired  when  interacting  with 
information  society  service  providers,  or  in  the  context  of  screenless  smart  devices,  as 
referred to above at paragraph 19. Where a data controller has chosen to provide information 
to  a  data  subject  orally,  or  a  data  subject  requests  the  provision  of  oral  information  or 
communications, WP29’s position is that the data controller should allow the data subject to 
re-listen to pre-recorded messages. This is imperative where the request for oral information 
relates to visually impaired data subjects or other data subjects who may have difficulty in 
accessing or understanding information in written format. The data controller should also 
ensure that it has a record of, and can demonstrate (for the purposes of complying with the 
accountability requirement): (i) the request for the information by oral means, (ii) the method 
by which the data subject’s identity was verified (where applicable – see above at paragraph 
20) and (iii) the fact that information was provided to the data subject. 

“Free of charge”  
 
Under Article 12.5,27 data controllers cannot generally charge data subjects for the provision 
of  information  under  Articles  13  and  14,  or  for  communications  and  actions  taken  under 
Articles 15 - 22 (on the rights of data subjects) and Article 34 (communication of personal data 
breaches to data subjects).28 This aspect of transparency also means that any information 
provided under the transparency requirements cannot be made conditional upon financial 
transactions, for example the payment for, or purchase of, services or goods.29  

Information to be provided to the data subject – Articles 13 & 14 

 

23. 

Content 
 
The  GDPR  lists  the  categories  of  information  that  must  be  provided  to  a  data  subject  in 
relation to the processing of their personal data where it is collected from the data subject 
(Article 13) or obtained from another source (Article 14).  The table in the Annex to these 

                                                           
27 This states that “Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under 
Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge.” 
28 However, under Article 12.5 the controller may charge a reasonable fee where, for example, a request by a data subject 
in relation to the information under Article 13 and 14 or the rights under Articles 15 - 22 or Article 34 is excessive or manifestly 
unfounded. (Separately, in relation to the right of access under Article 15.3 a controller may charge a reasonable fee based 
on administrative costs for any further copy of the personal data which is requested by a data subject). 
29 By way of illustration, if a data subject’s personal data is being collected in connection with a purchase, the information 
which is required to be provided under Article 13 should be provided prior to payment being made and at the point at which 
the information is being collected, rather than after the transaction has been concluded. Equally though, where free services 
are being provided to the data subject, the Article 13 information must be provided prior to, rather than after, sign-up given 
that Article 13.1 requires the provision of the information “at the time when the personal data are obtained”. 

 

Page 13 of 40 

guidelines summarises the categories of information that must be provided under Articles 13 
and 14. It also considers the nature, scope and content of these requirements.  For clarity, 
WP29’s position is that there is no difference between  the status of the information to be 
provided under sub-article 1 and 2 of Articles 13 and 14 respectively. All of the information 
across these sub-articles is of equal importance and must be provided to the data subject. 

“Appropriate measures” 
 
As well as content, the form and manner in which the information required under Articles 13 
and 14 should be provided to the data subject is also important. The notice containing such 
information  is  frequently  referred  to  as  a  data  protection  notice,  privacy  notice,  privacy 
policy, privacy statement or fair processing notice. The GDPR does not prescribe the format 
or modality by which such information should be provided to the data subject but does make 
it clear that it is the data controller’s responsibility to take “appropriate measures” in relation 
to the provision of the required information for transparency purposes. This means that the 
data controller should take into account all of the circumstances of the data collection and 
processing  when  deciding  upon  the  appropriate  modality  and  format  of  the  information 
provision. In particular, appropriate measures will need to be assessed in light of the product/ 
service  user  experience.  This  means  taking  account  of  the  device  used  (if  applicable),  the 
nature of the user interfaces/ interactions with the data controller (the user “journey”) and 
the limitations that those factors entail. As noted above at paragraph 17, WP29 recommends 
that where  a  data  controller  has  an  online presence,  an  online  layered privacy statement/ 
notice should be provided. 
 
In  order  to  help  identify  the  most  appropriate  modality  for  providing  the  information,  in 
advance of “going live”, data controllers may wish to trial different modalities by way of user 
testing  (e.g.  hall  tests,  or  other  standardised  tests  of  readability  or  accessibility)  to  seek 
feedback on how accessible, understandable and easy to use the proposed measure is for 
users. (See also further comments above on other mechanisms for carrying out user testing 
at  paragraph  9).  Documenting  this  approach  should  also  assist  data  controllers  with  their 
accountability obligations by demonstrating how the tool/ approach chosen to convey the 
information is the most appropriate in the circumstances.  

Timing for provision of information  
 
Articles  13  and  14  set  out  information  which  must  be  provided  to  the  data  subject  at  the 
commencement phase of the processing cycle30. Article 13 applies to the scenario where the 
data is collected from the data subject. This includes personal data that:

30 Pursuant to the principles of fairness and purpose limitation, the organisation which collects the personal data from the 
data  subject  should  always  specify  the  purposes  of  the  processing  at  the  time  of  collection.  If  the  purpose  includes  the 
creation of inferred personal data, the intended purpose of creating and further processing such inferred personal data, as 
well as the categories of the inferred data processed, must always be communicated to the data subject at the time of 
collection, or prior to the further processing for a new purpose in compliance with Article 13.3 or Article 14.4.

 

 

a  data  subject  consciously  provides  to  a  data  controller  (e.g.  when  completing  an 
online form); or 
a data controller collects from a data subject by observation (e.g. using automated 
data  capturing  devices  or  data  capturing  software  such  as  cameras,  network 
equipment, Wi-Fi tracking, RFID or other types of sensors). 
 

Article  14  applies  in  the  scenario  where  the  data  have  not  been  obtained  from  the  data 
subject. This includes personal data which a data controller has obtained from sources such 
as:  

 

 

 

third party data controllers; 
publicly available sources; 
data brokers; or 
other data subjects. 

 
 
As regards timing of the provision of this information, providing it in a timely manner is a vital 
element  of  the  transparency  obligation  and  the  obligation  to  process  data  fairly.  Where 
Article  13  applies,  under  Article  13.1  the  information  must  be  provided  “at  the  time  when 
personal data are obtained”. In the case of indirectly obtained personal data under Article 14, 
the timeframes within which the required information must be provided to the data subject 
are set out in Article 14.3 (a) to (c) as follows: 
 
 

The  general  requirement  is  that  the  information  must  be  provided  within  a 
“reasonable period” after obtaining the personal data and no later than one month, 
“having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed” 
(Article 14.3(a)).  
 
The general one-month time limit in Article 14.3(a) may be further curtailed under 
Article  14.3(b),31  which  provides  for  a  situation  where  the  data  are  being  used  for 
communication  with  the  data  subject.  In  such  a  case,  the  information  must  be 
provided at the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject. If 
the first communication occurs prior to the one-month time limit after obtaining the 
personal data, then the information must be provided at the latest at the time of the 
first communication with the data subject notwithstanding that one month from the 
point of obtaining the data has not expired. If the first communication with a data 
subject occurs more than one month after obtaining the personal data then Article 
14.3(a) continues to apply, so that the Article 14 information must be provided to the 
data subject at the latest within one month after it was obtained. 

 

 

                                                           
31 The use of the words “if the personal data are to be used for..” in Article 14.3(b) indicates a specification to the general 
position with regard to the maximum time limit set out in Article 14.3(a) but does not replace it. 

 

Page 15 of 40 

  The general one-month time limit in Article 14.3(a) can also be curtailed under Article 
14.3(c)32 which provides for a situation where the data are being disclosed to another 
recipient  (whether  a  third  party  or  not)33.  In  such  a  case,  the  information  must be 
provided  at  the  latest  at  the  time  of  the  first  disclosure.  In  this  scenario,  if  the 
disclosure occurs prior to the one-month time limit, then the information must be 
provided at the latest at the time of that first disclosure, notwithstanding that one 
month from the point of obtaining the data has not expired. Similar to the position 
with  Article  14.3(b),  if  any  disclosure  of  the  personal  data  occurs  more  than  one 
month  after  obtaining  the  personal  data,  then  Article  14.3(a)  again  continues  to 
apply, so that the Article 14 information must be provided to the data subject at the 
latest within one month after it was obtained. 

 
Therefore, in any case, the maximum time limit within which Article 14 information must be 
provided  to  a  data  subject  is  one  month.  However,  the  principles  of  fairness  and 
accountability under the GDPR require data controllers to always consider the reasonable 
expectations of data subjects, the effect that the processing may have on them and their 
ability to exercise their rights in relation to that processing, when deciding at what point to 
provide the  Article  14  information.  Accountability  requires  controllers  to  demonstrate  the 
rationale for their decision and justify why the information was provided at the time it was. 
In practice, it may be difficult to meet these requirements when providing information at the 
‘last moment’. In this regard, Recital 39 stipulates, amongst other things, that data subjects 
should be “made aware of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of 
personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing”. Recital 60 also 
refers to the requirement that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing 
operation and its purposes in the context of the principles of fair and transparent processing. 
For all of these reasons, WP29’s position is that, wherever possible, data controllers should, 
in accordance with the principle of fairness, provide the information to data subjects well in 
advance  of  the  stipulated  time  limits.  Further  comments  on  the  appropriateness  of  the 
timeframe between notifying data subjects of the processing operations and such processing 
operations actually taking effect are set out in paragraphs 30 to 31 and 48. 
 

Changes to Article 13 and Article 14 information  
 
Being  accountable  as  regards  transparency  applies  not  only  at  the  point  of  collection  of 
personal  data  but  throughout  the  processing  life  cycle,  irrespective  of  the  information  or 
communication being conveyed. This is the case, for example, when changing the contents 
of existing privacy statements/ notices. The controller should adhere to the same principles 
when  communicating  both  the  initial  privacy  statement/  notice  and  any  subsequent 
substantive or material changes to this statement/ notice. Factors which controllers should 
consider in assessing what is a substantive or material change include the impact on data 
subjects (including their ability to exercise their rights), and how unexpected/ surprising the 

28. 

29. 

                                                           
32 The use of the words “if a disclosure to anther recipient is envisaged...” in Article 14.3(c) likewise indicates a specification to 
the general position with regard to the maximum time limit set out in Article 14.3(a) but does not replace it. 
33 Article 4.9 defines “recipient” and clarifies that a recipient to whom personal data are disclosed does not have to be a third 
party. Therefore, a recipient may be a data controller, joint controller or processor. 

 

Page 16 of 40 

change would be to data subjects. Changes to a privacy statement/ notice that should always 
be  communicated  to  data  subjects  include  inter  alia:  a  change  in  processing  purpose;  a 
change to the identity of the controller; or a change as to how data subjects can exercise their 
rights  in  relation  to  the  processing.  Conversely,  an  example  of  changes  to  a  privacy 
statement/ notice which are not considered by WP29 to be substantive or material include 
corrections of misspellings, or stylistic/ grammatical flaws. Since most existing customers or 
users will only glance over communications of changes to privacy statements/ notices, the 
controller  should  take  all  measures  necessary  to  ensure  that  these  changes  are 
communicated in such a way that ensures that most recipients will actually notice them. This 
means, for example, that a notification of changes should always be communicated by way 
of  an  appropriate  modality  (e.g.  email,  hard  copy  letter,  pop-up  on  a  webpage  or  other 
modality  which  will  effectively  bring  the  changes  to  the  attention  of  the  data  subject) 
specifically devoted to those changes (e.g. not together with direct marketing content), with 
such a communication meeting the Article 12 requirements of being concise, transparent, 
intelligible, easily accessible and using clear and plain language. References in the privacy 
statement/  notice  to  the  effect  that  the  data  subject  should  regularly  check  the  privacy 
statement/notice for changes or updates are considered not only insufficient but also unfair 
in the context of Article 5.1(a). Further guidance in relation to the timing for notification of 
changes to data subjects is considered below at paragraph 30 to 31.  

 

Timing of notification of changes to Article 13 and Article 14 information 
 
The  GDPR  is  silent  on  the  timing  requirements  (and  indeed  the  methods)  that  apply  for 
notifications of changes to information that has previously been provided to a data subject 
under Article 13 or 14 (excluding an intended further purpose for processing, in which case 
information on that further purpose must be notified prior to the commencement of that 
further processing as per Articles 13.3 and 14.4 – see below at paragraph 45). However, as 
noted above in the context of the timing for the provision of Article 14 information, the data 
controller must again have regard to the fairness and accountability principles in terms of any 
reasonable expectations of the data subject, or the potential impact of those changes upon 
the data subject. If the change to the information is indicative of a fundamental change to 
the nature of the processing (e.g. enlargement of the categories of recipients or introduction 
of transfers to a third country) or a change which may not be fundamental in terms of the 
processing operation but which may be relevant to and impact upon the data subject, then 
that  information  should  be  provided  to  the  data  subject  well  in  advance  of  the  change 
actually  taking  effect  and  the  method  used  to  bring  the  changes  to  the  data  subject’s 
attention should be explicit and effective. This is to ensure the data subject does not “miss” 
the change and to allow the data subject a reasonable timeframe for them to (a) consider the 
nature and impact of the change and (b) exercise their rights under the GDPR in relation to 
the change (e.g. to withdraw consent or to object to the processing).  
 
Data controllers should carefully consider the circumstances and context of each situation 
where an update to transparency information is required, including the potential impact of 
the changes upon the data subject and the modality used to communicate the changes, and 
be  able  to  demonstrate  how  the  timeframe  between  notification  of  the  changes  and  the 

Page 17 of 40

31. 

 

change taking effect satisfies the principle of fairness to the data subject. Further, WP29’s 
position is that, consistent with the principle of fairness, when notifying such changes to data 
subjects, a data controller should also explain what will be the likely impact of those changes 
on  data  subjects.  However,  compliance  with  transparency  requirements  does  not 
“whitewash”  a  situation  where  the  changes  to  the  processing  are  so  significant  that  the 
processing becomes completely different in nature to what it was before. WP29 emphasises 
that  all  of  the  other  rules  in  the  GDPR,  including  those  relating  to  incompatible  further 
processing, continue to apply irrespective of compliance with the transparency obligations.  
 
Additionally,  even  when  transparency  information  (e.g.  contained  in  a  privacy  statement/ 
notice)  does  not  materially  change,  it  is  likely  that  data  subjects  who  have  been  using  a 
service for a significant period of time will not recall the information provided to them at the 
outset under Articles 13 and/or 14. WP29 recommends that controllers facilitate data subjects 
to have continuing easy access to the information to re-acquaint themselves with the scope 
of  the  data  processing.  In  accordance  with  the  accountability  principle,  controllers  should 
also consider whether, and at what intervals, it is appropriate for them to provide express 
reminders to data subjects as to the fact of the privacy statement/ notice and where they can 
find it. 

 

Modalities - format of information provision 
 
Both  Articles  13  and  14  refer  to  the  obligation  on  the  data  controller  to  “provide  the  data 
subject  with  all  of  the  following  information...”  The  operative  word  here  is  “provide”.  This 
means that the data controller must take active steps to furnish the information in question 
to the data subject or to actively direct the data subject to the location of it (e.g. by way of a 
direct  link,  use  of  a  QR  code,  etc.).  The  data  subject  must  not  have  to  actively  search  for 
information  covered  by  these  articles  amongst  other  information,  such  as  terms  and 
conditions of use of a website or app. The example at paragraph 11 illustrates this point. As 
noted  above  at  paragraph  17,  WP29  recommends  that  the  entirety  of  the  information 
addressed  to  data  subjects  should  also  be  available  to  them  in  one  single  place  or  one 
complete document (e.g. whether in a digital form on a website or in paper format) which 
can be easily accessed should they wish to consult the entirety of the information. 
 
 
There  is  an  inherent  tension  in  the  GDPR  between  the  requirements  on  the  one  hand  to 
provide the comprehensive information to data subjects which is required under the GDPR, 
and  on  the  other  hand  do  so  in  a  form  that  is  concise,  transparent,  intelligible  and  easily 
accessible.  As  such,  and  bearing  in  mind  the  fundamental principles  of  accountability  and 
fairness, controllers must undertake their own analysis of the nature, circumstances, scope 
and context of the processing of personal data which they carry out and decide, within the 
legal  requirements  of  the  GDPR  and  taking  account  of  the  recommendations  in  these 
Guidelines particularly at paragraph 36 below, how to prioritise information which must be 
provided  to  data  subjects  and  what  are  the  appropriate  levels  of  detail  and  methods  for 
conveying the information.

Layered approach in a digital environment and layered privacy statements/ notices 
 
In the digital context, in light of the volume of information which is required to be provided 
to the data subject, a layered approach may be followed by data controllers where they opt 
to use a combination of methods to ensure transparency. WP29 recommends in particular 
that layered privacy statements/ notices should be used to link to the various categories of 
information  which  must  be  provided  to  the  data  subject,  rather  than  displaying  all  such 
information in a single notice on the screen, in order to avoid information fatigue. Layered 
privacy  statements/  notices  can  help  resolve  the  tension  between  completeness  and 
understanding, notably by allowing users to navigate directly to the section of the statement/ 
notice that they wish to read. It should be noted that layered privacy statements/ notices are 
not merely nested pages that require several clicks to get to the relevant information. The 
design and layout of the first layer of the privacy statement/ notice should be such that the 
data subject has a clear overview of the information available to them on the processing of 
their personal data and where/ how they can find that detailed information within the layers 
of the privacy statement/ notice. It is also important that the information contained within 
the  different  layers  of  a  layered  notice  is  consistent  and  that  the  layers  do  not  provide 
conflicting information.  
 
As regards the content of the first modality used by a controller to inform data subjects in a 
layered approach (in other words the primary way in which the controller first engages with 
a data subject), or the content of the first layer of a layered privacy statement/ notice, WP29 
recommends  that  the  first  layer/  modality  should  include  the  details  of  the  purposes  of 
processing,  the  identity  of  controller  and  a  description  of  the  data  subject’s  rights. 
(Furthermore this information should be directly brought to the attention of a data subject 
at the time of collection of the personal data e.g. displayed as a data subject fills in an online 
form.) The importance of providing this information upfront arises in particular from Recital 
39.34  While  controllers  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  accountability  as  to  what  further 
information  they  decide  to  prioritise,  WP29’s  position  is  that,  in  line  with  the  fairness 
principle,  in  addition  to  the  information  detailed  above  in  this  paragraph,  the  first  layer/ 
modality should also contain information on the processing which has the most impact on 
the  data  subject  and  processing  which  could  surprise  them.  Therefore,  the  data  subject 
should be able to understand from information contained in the first layer/ modality what the 
consequences of the processing in question will be for the data subject (see  also above at 
paragraph 10).   
 
In a digital context, aside from providing an online layered privacy statement/ notice, data 
controllers  may  also  choose  to  use  additional  transparency  tools  (see  further  examples 
considered below) which provide tailored information to the individual data subject which is 
specific to the position of the individual data subject concerned and the goods/ services which 
that data subject is availing of. It should be noted however that while WP29 recommends the 

                                                           
34 Recital 39 states, on the principle of transparency, that “That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data 
subjects on the  identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and 
transparent processing in respect of natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication 
of personal data concerning them which are being processed.”

use of online layered privacy statements/ notices, this recommendation does not exclude the 
development  and  use  of  other  innovative  methods  of  compliance  with  transparency 
requirements.  

 

Layered approach in a non-digital environment 
 
A layered approach to the provision of transparency information to data subjects can also be 
deployed in an offline/ non-digital context (i.e. a real-world environment such as person-to-
person  engagement  or  telephone  communications)  where  multiple  modalities  may  be 
deployed by data controllers to facilitate the provision of information. (See also paragraphs 
33 to 37 and 39 to 40 in relation to different modalities for providing the information.) This 
approach  should  not  be  confused  with  the  separate  issue  of  layered  privacy  statements/ 
notices. Whatever the formats that are used in this layered approach, WP29 recommends 
that the first “layer” (in other words the primary way in which the controller first engages with 
the data subject) should generally convey the most important information (as referred to at 
paragraph  36  above),  namely  the  details  of  the  purposes  of  processing,  the  identity  of 
controller and the existence of the rights of the data subject, together with information on 
the greatest impact of processing or processing which could surprise the data subject. For 
example, where the first point of contact with a data subject is by telephone, this information 
could be provided during the telephone call with the data subject and they could be provided 
with the balance of the information required under Article 13/ 14 by way of further, different 
means, such as by sending a copy of the privacy policy by email and/ or sending the data 
subject a link to the controller’s layered online privacy statement/ notice.  
 

“Push” and “pull” notices 
 
Another possible way of providing transparency information is through the use of “push” and 
“pull” notices. Push notices involve the provision of “just-in-time” transparency information 
notices while “pull” notices facilitate access to information by methods such as permission 
management, privacy dashboards and “learn more” tutorials. These allow for a more user-
centric transparency experience for the data subject. 
 

 

A  privacy  dashboard  is  a  single  point  from  which  data  subjects  can  view  ‘privacy 
information’ and manage their privacy preferences by allowing or preventing their 
data from being used in certain ways by the service in question. This is particularly 
useful  when  the  same  service  is  used  by  data  subjects  on  a  variety  of  different 
devices as it gives them access to and control over their personal data no matter how 
they use the service. Allowing data subjects to manually adjust their privacy settings 
via a privacy dashboard can also make it easier for a privacy statement/ notice to be 
personalised by reflecting only the types of processing occurring for that particular 
data subject. Incorporating a privacy dashboard into the existing architecture of a 
service  (e.g.  by  using  the  same  design  and  branding  as  the  rest  of  the  service)  is 
preferable because it will ensure that access and use of it will be intuitive and may 
help to encourage users to engage with this information, in the same way that they 
would  with  other  aspects  of  the  service.  This  can  be  an  effective  way  of 

Page 20 of 40

demonstrating that ‘privacy information’ is a necessary and integral part of a service 
rather than a lengthy list of legalese. 

A just-in-time notice is used to provide specific ‘privacy information’ in an ad hoc 
manner, as and when it is most relevant for the data subject to read. This method is 
useful for providing information at various points throughout the process of  data 
collection;  it  helps  to  spread  the  provision  of  information  into  easily  digestible 
chunks  and  reduces  the  reliance  on  a  single  privacy statement/  notice  containing 
information  that  is  difficult  to  understand  out  of  context.  For  example,  if  a  data 
subject purchases a product online, brief explanatory information can be provided 
in  pop-ups  accompanying  relevant  fields  of  text.  The  information  next  to  a  field 
requesting the data subject’s telephone number could explain for example that this 
data is only being collected for the purposes of contact regarding the purchase and 
that it will only be disclosed to the delivery service.

Other types of “appropriate measures” 
 
Given the very high level of internet access in the EU and the fact that data subjects can go 
online at any time, from multiple locations and different devices, as stated above, WP29’s 
position is that an “appropriate measure” for providing transparency information in the case 
of data controllers who maintain a digital/ online presence, is to do so through an electronic 
privacy statement/ notice. However, based on the circumstances of the data collection and 
processing,  a  data  controller  may  need  to  additionally  (or  alternatively  where  the  data 
controller  does  not  have  any  digital/online  presence)  use  other  modalities  and  formats  to 
provide the information. Other possible ways to convey the information to the data subject 
arising from the following different personal data environments may include the following 
modes applicable to the relevant environment which are listed below. As noted previously, a 
layered approach may be followed by controllers where they opt to use a combination of such 
methods while ensuring that the most important information (see paragraph 36 and 38) is 
always conveyed in the first modality used to communicate with the data subject. 
 
a. 

Hard copy/ paper environment, for example when entering into contracts by postal 
means:  written  explanations,  leaflets,  information  in  contractual  documentation, 
cartoons, infographics or flowcharts; 
Telephonic environment: oral explanations by a real person to allow interaction and 
questions to be answered or automated or pre-recorded information with options to 
hear further more detailed information;  
Screenless  smart  technology/  IoT  environment  such  as  Wi-Fi  tracking  analytics: 
icons,  QR  codes,  voice  alerts,  written  details  incorporated  into  paper  set-up 
instructions, videos incorporated into digital set-up instructions, written information 
on the smart device, messages sent by SMS or email, visible boards containing the 
information, public signage or public information campaigns; 
Person  to  person  environment,  such  as  responding  to  opinion  polls,  registering  in 
person for a service: oral explanations or written explanations provided in hard or soft 
copy format;

information,  public  signage,  public  information  campaigns  or  newspaper/  media 
notices. 
 

Information on profiling and automated decision-making  
 
Information on the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred 
to in Articles 22.1 and 22.4, together with meaningful information about the logic involved  
and the significant and envisaged consequences of the processing for the data subject, forms 
part of the obligatory information which must be provided to a data subject under Articles 
13.2(f) and 14.2(g). WP29 has produced guidelines on automated individual decision-making 
and profiling35 which should be referred to for further guidance on how transparency should 
be given effect in the particular circumstances of profiling. It should be noted that, aside from 
the  specific  transparency  requirements  applicable  to  automated  decision-making  under 
Articles 13.2(f) and 14.2(g), the comments in these guidelines relating to the importance of 
informing data subjects as to the consequences of processing of their personal data, and the 
general principle that data subjects should not be taken by surprise by the processing of their 
personal  data,  equally  apply  to  profiling  generally  (not  just  profiling  which  is  captured  by 
Article 2236), as a type of processing.37 
 

Other issues – risks, rules and safeguards 
 
Recital  39  of  the  GDPR  also  refers  to  the  provision  of  certain  information  which  is  not 
explicitly covered by Articles 13 and Article 14 (see recital text above at paragraph 28). The 
reference in this recital to making data subjects aware of the risks, rules and safeguards in 
relation to the processing of personal data is connected to a number of other issues. These 
include data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). As set out in the WP29 Guidelines on 
DPIAs,38  data  controllers  may  consider  publication  of  the  DPIA  (or  part  of  it),  as  a  way  of 
fostering  trust 
in  the  processing  operations  and  demonstrating  transparency  and 
accountability,  although  such  publication  is  not  obligatory.  Furthermore,  adherence  to  a 
code of conduct (provided for under Article 40) may go towards demonstrating transparency, 
as codes of conduct may be drawn up for the purpose of specifying the application of the 
GDPR with regard to: fair and transparent processing; information provided to the public and 
to data subjects; and information provided to, and the protection of, children, amongst other 
issues.   
 
Another relevant issue relating to transparency is data protection by design and by default 
(as  required  under  Article  25).  These  principles  require  data  controllers  to  build  data 

41.

35 Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, WP 251 
36 This applies to decision-making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects 
concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affects him or her. 
37  Recital  60,  which  is  relevant  here,  states  that  “Furthermore,  the  data  subject  should  be  informed  of  the  existence  of 
profiling and the consequences of such profiling”.  
38 Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is “likely to result in a high 
risk” for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, WP 248 rev.1

protection considerations into their processing operations and systems from the ground up, 
rather than taking account of data protection as a last-minute compliance issue. Recital 78 
refers  to  data  controllers  implementing  measures  that  meet  the  requirements  of  data 
protection  by  design  and  by  default  including  measures  consisting  of  transparency  with 
regard to the functions and processing of personal data.  
 
Separately, the issue of joint controllers is also related to making data subjects aware of the 
risks, rules and safeguards. Article 26.1 requires joint controllers to determine their respective 
responsibilities for complying with obligations under the GDPR in a transparent manner, in 
particular with regard to the exercise by data subjects of their rights and the duties to provide 
the  information  under  Articles  13  and  14.  Article  26.2  requires  that  the  essence  of  the 
arrangement between the data controllers must be made available to the data subject. In 
other words, it must be completely clear to a data a subject as to which data controller he or 
she can approach where they intend to exercise one or more of their rights under the GDPR.39 
 

Information related to further processing 
 
45. 

Both Articles 13 and Article 14 contain a provision40 that requires a data controller to inform 
a data subject if it intends to further process their personal data for a purpose other than that 
for which it was collected/ obtained. If so, “the controller shall provide the data subject prior to 
that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further 
information  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  2”.  These  provisions  specifically  give  effect  to  the 
principle  in  Article  5.1(b)  that  personal  data  shall  be  collected  for  specified,  explicit  and 
legitimate  purposes,  and  further  processing  in  a  manner  that  is  incompatible  with  these 
purposes is prohibited.41 The second part of Article 5.1(b) states that further processing for 
archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest,  scientific  or  historical  research  purposes  or  for 
statistical  purposes,  shall,  in  accordance  with  Article  89.1,  not  be  considered  to  be 
incompatible  with  the  initial  purposes.  Where  personal  data  are  further  processed  for 
purposes  that  are  compatible  with  the  original  purposes  (Article  6.4  informs  this  issue42), 
Articles 13.3 and 14.4 apply. The requirements in these articles to inform a data subject about 
further processing promotes the position in the GDPR that a data subject should reasonably 
expect that at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data that processing 

                                                           
39 Under Article 26.3, irrespective of the terms of the arrangement between joint data controllers under Article 26.1, a data 
subject may exercise his or her rights under the GDPR in respect of and against each of the joint data controllers. 
40 At Articles 13.3 and 14.4, which are expressed in identical terms, apart from the word “collected”, which is used in Article 
13, and which is replaced with the word “obtained” in Article 14. 
41 See, for example on this principle, Recitals 47, 50, 61, 156, 158; Articles 6.4 and 89 
42 Article 6.4 sets out, in non-exhaustive fashion, the factors which are to be taken into account in ascertaining whether 
processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, namely: 
the link between the purposes; the context in which the personal data have been collected; the nature of the personal data 
(in particular whether special categories of personal data or personal data relating to criminal offences and convictions are 
included); the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate 
safeguards.

48. 

for a particular purpose may take place.43 In other words, a data subject should not be taken 
by surprise at the purpose of processing of their personal data.  
 
Articles 13.3 and 14.4, insofar as they refer to the provision of “any relevant further information 
as referred to in paragraph 2”, may be interpreted at first glance as leaving some element of 
appreciation  to  the  data  controller  as  to  the  extent  of  and  the  particular  categories  of 
information from the relevant sub-paragraph 2 (i.e. Article 13.2 or 14.2 as applicable) that 
should  be  provided  to  the  data  subject.  (Recital  61  refers  to  this  as  “other  necessary 
information”.) However the default position is that all such information set out in that sub-
article  should  be  provided  to  the  data  subject  unless  one  or  more  categories  of  the 
information does not exist or is not applicable.  
 
WP29 recommends that, in order to be transparent, fair and accountable, controllers should 
consider making information available to data subjects in their privacy statement/ notice on 
the  compatibility  analysis  carried  out  under  Article  6.444  where  a  legal  basis  other  than 
consent or national/ EU law is relied on for the new processing purpose. (In other words, an 
explanation as to how the processing for the other purpose(s) is compatible with the original 
purpose). This is to allow data subjects the opportunity to consider the compatibility of the 
further processing and the safeguards provided and to decide whether to exercise their rights 
e.g.  the  right  to  restriction  of  processing  or  the  right  to  object  to  processing,  amongst 
others.45  Where  controllers  choose  not  to  include  such  information  in  a  privacy  notice/ 
statement, WP29 recommends that they make it clear to data subjects that they can obtain 
the information on request. 
 
Connected to the exercise of data subject rights is the issue of timing. As emphasised above, 
the  provision  of  information  in  a  timely  manner  is  a  vital  element  of  the  transparency 
requirements  under  Articles  13  and  14  and  is  inherently  linked  to  the  concept  of  fair 
processing.  Information  in  relation  to  further  processing  must  be  provided  “prior  to  that 
further processing”. WP29’s position is that a reasonable period should occur between the 
notification  and  the  processing  commencing  rather  than  an  immediate  start  to  the 
processing upon notification being received by the data subject. This gives data subjects the 
practical benefits of the principle of transparency, allowing them a meaningful opportunity 
to consider (and potentially exercise their rights in relation to) the further processing. What 
is a reasonable period will depend on the particular circumstances. The principle of fairness 
requires  that  the  more  intrusive  (or  less  expected)  the  further  processing,  the  longer  the 
period should be. Equally, the principle of accountability requires that data controllers be able 
to  demonstrate  how  the  determinations  they  have  made  as  regards  the  timing  for  the 
provision of this information are justified in the circumstances and how the timing overall is 
fair to data subjects. (See also the previous comments in relation to ascertaining reasonable 
timeframes above at paragraphs 30 to 32.) 

                                                           
43 Recitals 47 and 50 
44 Also referenced in Recital 50 
45 As referenced in Recital 63, this will enable a data subject to exercise the right of access in order to be aware of and to 
verify the lawfulness of the processing.

Importantly, the principle of transparency in the GDPR is not limited to being effected simply 
through  language  communications  (whether  written  or  oral).  The  GDPR  provides  for 
visualisation  tools  (referencing  in  particular,  icons,  certification  mechanisms,  and  data 
protection seals and marks) where appropriate. Recital 5846 indicates that the accessibility of 
information addressed to the public or to data subjects is especially important in the online 
environment.47  
 

Icons 
 
Recital 60 makes provision for information to be provided to a data subject “in combination” 
with  standardised  icons,  thus  allowing  for  a  multi-layered  approach.  However,  the  use  of 
icons  should  not  simply  replace  information  necessary  for  the  exercise  of  a  data  subject’s 
rights  nor  should  they  be  used  as  a  substitute  to  compliance  with  the  data  controller’s 
obligations under Articles 13 and 14. Article 12.7 provides for the use of such icons stating 
that: 
 

“The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be 
provided  in  combination  with  standardised  icons  in  order  to  give  in  an  easily  visible, 
intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. 
Where icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable”. 

As Article 12.7 states that “Where the icons are presented electronically, they shall be machine-
readable”,  this  suggests  that  there  may  be  situations  where  icons  are  not  presented 
electronically,48  for  example  icons  on  physical  paperwork,  IoT  devices  or  IoT  device 
packaging, notices in public places about Wi-Fi tracking, QR codes and CCTV notices. 
 
Clearly, the purpose of using icons is to enhance transparency for data subjects by potentially 
reducing the need for vast amounts of written information to be presented to a data subject. 
However, the utility of icons to effectively convey information required under Articles 13 and 
14  to  data  subjects  is  dependent  upon  the  standardisation  of  symbols/  images  to  be 

                                                           
46  “Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. 
This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice 
make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data 
relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising.” 

47 In this context, controllers should take into account visually impaired data subjects (e.g. red-green colour blindness). 
48 There  is no definition of  “machine-readable”  in the GDPR but  Recital 21 of  Directive  2013/37/EU17 defines “machine-
readable” as:  

“a file format structured so that software applications can easily identify, recognize and  extract specific data, including 
individual statements of fact, and their internal structure. Data encoded in files that are structured in a machine-readable 
format are machine-readable data. Machine-readable formats can be open or proprietary; they can be formal standards or 
not. Documents encoded in a file format that limits automatic processing, because the data cannot, or cannot easily, be 
extracted  from  them,  should  not  be  considered  to  be  in  a  machine-readable  format.  Member  States  should  where 
appropriate encourage the use of open, machine-readable formats.”

universally  used  and  recognised  across  the  EU  as  shorthand  for  that  information.  In  this 
regard,  the  GDPR  assigns  responsibility  for  the  development  of  a  code  of  icons  to  the 
Commission but ultimately the European Data Protection Board may, either at the request 
of the Commission or of its own accord, provide the Commission with an opinion on such 
icons.49 WP29 recognises that, in line with Recital 166, the development of a code of icons 
should  be  centred  upon  an  evidence-based  approach  and  in  advance  of  any  such 
standardisation  it  will  be  necessary  for  extensive  research  to  be  conducted  in  conjunction 
with industry and the wider public as to the efficacy of icons in this context. 

 

53. 

Certification mechanisms, seals and marks 
 
Aside from the use of standardised icons, the GDPR (Article 42) also provides for the use of 
data protection certification mechanisms, data protection seals and marks for the purpose of 
demonstrating compliance with the GDPR of processing operations by data controllers and 
processors and enhancing transparency for data subjects.50 WP29 will be issuing guidelines 
on certification mechanisms in due course.  
 

Exercise of data subjects’ rights 
 
54. 

 

Transparency  places  a  triple  obligation  upon  data  controllers  insofar  as  the  rights  of  data 
subjects under the GDPR are concerned, as they must:51  
 
 

provide  information  to  data  subjects  on  their  rights52  (as  required  under  Articles 
13.2(b) and 14.2(c)); 
comply  with  the  principle  of  transparency  (i.e.  relating  to  the  quality  of  the 
communications as set out in Article 12.1) when communicating with data subjects 
in relation to their rights under Articles 15 to 22 and 34; and 
facilitate the exercise of data subjects’ rights under Articles 15 to 22.  

 
 
The  GDPR  requirements  in  relation  to  the  exercise  of  these  rights  and  the  nature  of  the 
information  required  are  designed  to  meaningfully  position  data  subjects  so  that  they  can 
vindicate  their  rights  and  hold  data  controllers  accountable  for  the  processing  of  their 
personal data. Recital 59 emphasises that “modalities should be provided for facilitating the 
exercise of the data subject’s rights” and that the data controller should “also provide means 

55. 

                                                           
49 Article 12.8 provides that the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts under Article 92 for the purpose of 
determining the information to be presented by the icons and the information for providing standardised icons. Recital 
166 (which deals with delegated acts of the Commission in general) is instructive, providing that the Commission must 
carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. However, the European Data 
Protection  Board  (EDPB)  also  has  an  important  consultative  role  to  play  in  relation  to  the  standardisation  of  icons  as 
Article 70.1(r) states that the EDPB shall on its own initiative or, where relevant, at the request of the Commission, provide 
the Commission with an opinion on icons.

for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic 
means”. The modality provided by a data controller for data subjects to exercise their rights 
should  be  appropriate  to  the  context  and  the  nature  of  the  relationship  and  interactions 
between the controller and a data subject. To this end, a data controller may wish to provide 
one or more different modalities for the exercise of rights that are reflective of the different 
ways in which data subjects interact with that data controller.  
 

Example 
 
A health service provider uses an electronic form on its website, and paper forms in 
the receptions of its health clinics, to facilitate the submission of access requests for 
personal data both online and in person. While it provides these modalities, the health 
service still accepts access requests submitted in other ways (such as by letter and by 
email) and provides a dedicated point of contact (which can be accessed by email and 
by telephone) to help data subjects with the exercise of their rights.  
 

Exceptions to the obligation to provide information  

 

56. 

Article 13 exceptions 
 
The only exception to a data controller’s Article 13 obligations where it has collected personal 
data directly from a data subject occurs “where and insofar as, the data subject already has the 
information”.53  The  principle  of  accountability  requires  that  data  controllers  demonstrate 
(and document) what information the data subject already has, how and when they received 
it and that no changes have since occurred to that information that would render it out of 
date. Further, the use of the phrase “insofar as” in Article 13.4 makes it clear that even if the 
data  subject  has  previously  been  provided  with  certain  categories  from  the  inventory  of 
information  set  out  in  Article  13,  there  is  still  an  obligation  on  the  data  controller  to 
supplement that information in order to ensure that the data subject now has a complete set 
of the information listed in Articles 13.1 and 13.2. The following is a best practice example 
concerning the limited manner in which the Article 13.4 exception should be construed. 
 

 
Example 
 
An individual signs up to an online email service and receives all of the required Article 
13.1 and 13.2 information at the point of sign-up. Six months later the data subject 
activates  a  connected  instant  message  functionality  through  the  email  service 
provider and provides their mobile telephone number to do so. The service provider 
gives the data subject certain Article 13.1 and 13.2 information about the processing 
of  the  telephone  number  (e.g.  purposes  and  legal  basis  for  processing,  recipients, 
retention period) but does not provide other information that the individual already 

                                                           
53 Article 13.4 

 

Page 27 of 40 

has from 6 months ago and which has not since changed (e.g. the identity and contact 
details of the controller and the data protection officer, information on data subject 
rights and the right to complain to the relevant supervisory authority). As a matter of 
best practice however, the complete suite of information should be provided to the 
data  subject  again  but  the  data  subject  also  should  be  able  to  easily  tell  what 
information amongst it is new. The new processing for the purposes of the instant 
messaging service may affect the data subject in a way which would prompt them to 
seek  to  exercise  a  right  they  may  have  forgotten  about,  having  been  informed  six 
months  prior.  Providing  all  the  information  again  helps  to  ensure  the  data  subject 
remains well informed about how their data is being used and their rights. 

 

 

Article 14 exceptions 
 
Article 14 carves out a much broader set of exceptions to the information obligation on a data 
controller  where  personal  data  has  not  been  obtained  from  the  data  subject.  These 
exceptions should, as a general rule, be interpreted and applied narrowly. In addition to the 
circumstances  where  the  data  subject  already  has  the  information  in  question  (Article 
14.5(a)), Article 14.5 also allows for the following exceptions: 
 
 

The provision of such information is impossible or would involve a disproportionate 
effort,  in  particular  for  processing  for  archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest, 
scientific  or  historical  research  purposes  or  statistical  purposes,  or  where  it  would 
make  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  processing  impossible  or  seriously 
impair them;  
The data controller is subject to a national law or EU law requirement to obtain or 
disclose the personal data and that the law provides appropriate protections for the 
data subject’s legitimate interests ; or  
An  obligation  of  professional  secrecy  (including  a  statutory  obligation  of  secrecy) 
which  is  regulated  by  national  or  EU  law  means  the  personal  data  must  remain 
confidential. 

 

 

 

Proves impossible, disproportionate effort and serious impairment of objectives 
 
Article  14.5(b)  allows  for  3  separate  situations  where  the  obligation  to  provide  the 
information set out in Articles 14.1, 14.2 and 14.4 is lifted: 
 
(i) 

Where it proves impossible (in particular for archiving, scientific/ historical research 
or statistical purposes); 
Where it would involve a disproportionate effort (in particular for archiving, scientific/ 
historical research or statistical purposes); or 

(ii) 

57. 

58. 

(iii)  Where  providing  the  information  required  under  Article  14.1  would  make  the 
achievement of the objectives of the processing impossible or seriously impair them.

“Proves impossible” 
 
The situation where it “proves impossible” under Article 14.5(b) to provide the information is 
an all or nothing situation because something is either impossible or it is not; there are no 
degrees  of  impossibility.  Thus  if  a  data  controller  seeks  to  rely  on  this  exemption  it  must 
demonstrate the factors that actually prevent it from providing the information in question 
to data subjects. If, after a certain period of time, the factors that caused the “impossibility” 
no longer exist and it becomes possible to provide the information to data subjects then the 
data  controller  should  immediately  do  so.  In  practice,  there  will  be  very  few  situations  in 
which  a  data  controller  can  demonstrate  that  it  is  actually  impossible  to  provide  the 
information to data subjects. The following example demonstrates this. 
  

Example 

A data subject registers for a post-paid online subscription service. After registration, the 
data controller collects credit data from a credit-reporting agency on the data subject in 
order to decide whether to provide the service. The controller’s protocol is to inform data 
subjects of the collection of this credit data within three days of collection, pursuant to 
Article 14.3(a). However, the data subject’s address and phone number is not registered 
in public registries (the data subject is in fact living abroad). The data subject did not leave 
an  email  address  when  registering  for  the  service  or  the  email  address  is  invalid.  The 
controller  finds  that  it  has  no  means  to  directly  contact  the  data  subject.  In  this  case, 
however, the controller may give information about collection of credit reporting data on 
its  website,  prior  to  registration.  In  this  case,  it  would  not  be  impossible  to  provide 
information pursuant to Article 14. 

Impossibility of providing the source of the data 
 
Recital 61 states that “where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data 
subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided”. The 
lifting of the requirement to provide data subjects with information on the source of their 
personal data applies only where this is not possible because different pieces of personal data 
relating to the same data subject cannot be attributed to a particular source. For example, 
the  mere  fact  that  a  database  comprising  the  personal  data  of  multiple  data subjects  has 
been  compiled  by  a  data  controller  using  more  than  one  source  is  not  enough  to  lift  this 
requirement if it is possible (although time consuming or burdensome) to identify the source 
from which the personal data of individual data subjects derived. Given the requirements of 
data protection by design and by default,54 transparency mechanisms should be built into 
processing systems from the ground up so that all sources of personal data received into an 
organisation  can  be  tracked  and  traced  back  to  their  source  at  any  point  in  the  data 
processing life cycle (see paragraph 43 above).

62. 

“Disproportionate effort” 
 
Under  Article  14.5(b),  as  with  the  “proves  impossible”  situation,  “disproportionate  effort”  
may  also  apply,  in  particular,  for  processing  “for  archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest, 
scientific  or  historical  research  purposes  or  statistical  purposes,  subject  to  the  safeguards 
referred  to  in  Article  89(1)”.  Recital  62  also  references  these  objectives  as  cases  where  the 
provision  of  information  to  the  data  subject  would  involve  a  disproportionate  effort  and 
states  that  in  this  regard,  the  number  of  data  subjects,  the  age  of  the  data  and  any 
appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration. Given the emphasis in 
Recital 62 and Article 14.5(b) on archiving, research and statistical purposes with regard to 
the  application  of  this  exemption,  WP29’s  position  is  that  this  exception  should  not  be 
routinely  relied  upon  by  data  controllers  who  are  not  processing  personal  data  for  the 
purposes of archiving in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or 
statistical purposes. WP29 emphasises the fact that where these are the purposes pursued, 
the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  89.1  must  still  be  complied  with  and  the  provision  of  the 
information must constitute a disproportionate effort. 
 
In  determining  what  may  constitute  either  impossibility  or  disproportionate  effort  under 
Article 14.5(b), it is relevant that there are no comparable exemptions under Article 13 (where 
personal data is collected from a data subject). The only difference between an Article 13 and 
an Article 14 situation is that in the latter, the personal data is not collected from the data 
subject. It therefore follows that impossibility or disproportionate effort typically arises by 
virtue of circumstances which do not apply if the personal data is collected from the data 
subject.  In  other  words,  the  impossibility  or  disproportionate  effort  must  be  directly 
connected to the fact that the personal data was obtained other than from the data subject.  

Example  
 
A  large  metropolitan  hospital  requires  all  patients  for  day  procedures,  longer-term 
admissions and appointments to fill in a Patient Information Form which seeks the details 
of  two  next-of-kin  (data  subjects).  Given  the  very  large  volume  of  patients  passing 
through the hospital on a daily basis, it would involve disproportionate effort on the part 
of the hospital to provide all persons who have been listed as next-of-kin on forms filled 
in by patients each day with the information required under Article 14. 

63. 

 
The factors referred to above in Recital 62 (number of data subjects, the age of the data and 
any appropriate safeguards adopted) may be indicative of the types of issues that contribute 
to  a  data  controller  having  to  use  disproportionate  effort  to  notify  a  data  subject  of  the 
relevant Article 14 information.  

 

 

Example  
 
Historical researchers seeking to trace lineage based on surnames indirectly obtain a 
large dataset relating to 20,000 data subjects. However, the dataset was collected 50 

Page 30 of 40 

years  ago,  has  not  been  updated  since,  and  does  not  contain  any  contact  details. 
Given the size of the database and more particularly, the age of the data, it would 
involve disproportionate effort for the researchers to try to trace the data subjects 
individually in order to provide them with Article 14 information.  

 

64.  Where  a  data  controller  seeks  to rely  on the exception  in  Article  14.5(b)  on  the  basis  that 
provision  of  the  information  would  involve  a  disproportionate  effort,  it  should  carry  out  a 
balancing  exercise  to  assess  the  effort  involved  for  the  data  controller  to  provide  the 
information to the data subject against the impact and effects on the data subject if he or she 
was not provided with the information. This assessment should be documented by the data 
controller  in  accordance  with  its  accountability  obligations.  In  such  a  case,  Article  14.5(b) 
specifies that the controller must take appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s 
rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. This applies equally where a controller determines 
that the provision of the information proves impossible, or would likely render impossible or 
seriously  impair  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  processing.  One  appropriate 
measure,  as  specified  in  Article  14.5(b),  that  controllers  must  always  take  is  to  make  the 
information publicly available. A controller can do this in a number of ways, for instance by 
putting  the  information  on  its  website,  or  by  proactively  advertising  the  information  in  a 
newspaper or on posters on its premises. Other appropriate measures, in addition to making 
the information publicly available, will depend on the circumstances of the processing, but 
may include: undertaking a data protection impact assessment; applying pseudonymisation 
techniques  to  the  data;  minimising  the  data  collected  and  the  storage  period;  and 
implementing  technical  and  organisational  measures  to  ensure  a  high  level  of  security. 
Furthermore,  there  may  be  situations  where  a  data  controller  is  processing  personal  data 
which does not require the identification of a data subject (for example with pseudonymised 
data). In such cases, Article 11.1 may also be relevant as it states that a data controller shall 
not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the 
data subject for the sole purposes of complying with the GDPR.  
 

Serious impairment of objectives 
 
The  final  situation  covered  by  Article  14.5(b)  is  where  a  data  controller’s  provision  of  the 
information to a data subject under Article 14.1 is likely to make impossible or seriously impair 
the achievement of the processing objectives. To rely on this exception, data controllers must 
demonstrate that the provision of the information set out in Article 14.1 alone would nullify 
the  objectives  of  the  processing.  Notably,  reliance  on  this  aspect  of  Article  14.5(b)  pre-
supposes that the data processing satisfies all of the principles set out in Article 5 and that 
most importantly, in all of the circumstances, the processing of the personal data is fair and 
that it has a legal basis. 
 

Example  
 
Bank  A  is  subject  to  a  mandatory  requirement  under  anti-money  laundering 
legislation to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held with it to the relevant 
financial  law  enforcement  authority.  Bank  A  receives  information  from  Bank  B  (in 

Page 31 of 40 

65. 

 

another Member State) that an account holder has instructed it to transfer money to 
another account held with Bank A which appears suspicious. Bank A passes this data 
concerning its account holder and the suspicious activities to the relevant financial 
law enforcement authority. The anti-money laundering legislation in question makes 
it a criminal offence for a reporting bank to “tip off” the account holder that they may 
be  subject  to  regulatory  investigations.  In  this  situation,  Article  14.5(b)  applies 
because providing the data subject (the account holder with Bank A) with Article 14 
information on the processing of account holder’s personal data received from Bank 
B  would  seriously  impair  the  objectives  of  the  legislation,  which  includes  the 
prevention  of  “tip-offs”.  However,  general  information  should  be  provided  to  all 
account holders with Bank A when an account is opened that their personal data may 
be processed for anti-money laundering purposes. 

 
 

Obtaining or disclosing is expressly laid down in law 
 
Article 14.5(c) allows for a lifting of the information requirements in Articles 14.1, 14.2 and 
14.4 insofar as the obtaining or disclosure of personal data “is expressly laid down by Union or 
Member State law to which the controller is subject”. This exemption is conditional upon the 
law  in  question  providing  “appropriate  measures  to  protect  the  data  subject’s  legitimate 
interests”. Such a law must directly address the data controller and the obtaining or disclosure 
in question should be mandatory upon the data controller. Accordingly, the data controller 
must be able to demonstrate how the law in question applies to them and requires them to 
either obtain or disclose the personal data in question. While it is for Union or Member State 
law to frame the law such that it provides “appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s 
legitimate interests”, the data controller should ensure (and be able to demonstrate) that its 
obtaining  or  disclosure  of  personal  data  complies  with  those  measures.  Furthermore,  the 
data controller should make it clear to data subjects that it obtains or discloses personal data 
in accordance with the law in question, unless there is a legal prohibition preventing the data 
controller from doing so. This is in line with Recital 41 of the GDPR, which states that a legal 
basis  or  legislative  measure  should  be  clear  and  precise,  and  its  application  should  be 
foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of 
the  EU  and  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights.  However,  Article  14.5(c)  will  not  apply 
where the data controller is under an obligation to obtain data directly from a data subject, in 
which case Article 13 will apply. In that case, the only exemption under the GDPR exempting 
the controller from providing the data subject with information on the processing will be that 
under Article 13.4 (i.e. where and insofar as the data subject already has the information). 
However, as referred to below at paragraph 68, at a national level, Member States may also 
legislate,  in  accordance  with  Article  23,  for  further  specific  restrictions  to  the  right  to 
transparency under Article 12 and to information under Articles 13 and 14. 

Example  
 
A tax authority is subject to a mandatory requirement under national law to obtain the 
details of employees’ salaries from their employers. The personal data is not obtained 

Page 32 of 40 

66. 

 

 

 

67. 

 

from the data subjects and therefore the tax authority is subject to the requirements of 
Article 14. As the obtaining of the personal data by the tax authority from employers is 
expressly laid down by law, the information requirements in Article 14 do not apply to the 
tax authority in this instance. 
 

Confidentiality by virtue of a secrecy obligation 
 
Article  14.5(d)  provides  for  an  exemption  to  the  information  requirement  upon  data 
controllers  where  the  personal  data  “must  remain  confidential  subject  to  an  obligation  of 
professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation 
of  secrecy”.  Where  a  data  controller  seeks  to  rely  on  this  exemption,  it  must  be  able  to 
demonstrate  that  it  has  appropriately  identified  such  an  exemption  and  to  show  how  the 
professional secrecy obligation directly addresses the data controller such that it prohibits 
the data controller from providing all of the information set out in Articles 14.1, 14.2 and 14.4 
to the data subject. 

Example  
 
A medical practitioner (data controller) is under a professional obligation of secrecy in 
relation to his patients’ medical information. A patient (in respect of whom the obligation 
of professional secrecy applies) provides the medical practitioner with information about 
her health relating to a genetic condition, which a number of her close relatives also have. 
The  patient  also  provides  the  medical  practitioner  with  certain  personal  data  of  her 
relatives (data subjects)  who have the same condition. The  medical practitioner is not 
required to provide those relatives with Article 14 information as the exemption in Article 
14.5(d) applies. If the medical practitioner were to provide the Article 14 information to 
the relatives, the obligation of professional secrecy, which he owes to his patient, would 
be violated. 
 

Restrictions on data subject rights 

68. 

 
Article 23 provides for Member States (or the EU) to legislate for further restrictions on the 
scope of the data subject rights in relation to transparency and the substantive data subject 
rights55 where such measures respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms 
and are necessary and proportionate to safeguard one or more of the ten objectives set out 
in Article 23.1(a) to (j). Where such national measures lessen either the specific data subject 
rights  or  the  general  transparency  obligations,  which  would  otherwise  apply  to  data 
controllers  under  the  GDPR,  the  data  controller  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  how  the 
national provision applies to them. As set out in Article 23.2(h), the legislative measure must 
contain a provision as to the right of the data subject to be informed about a restriction on 

                                                           
55 As set out in Articles 12 to 22 and 34, and in Article 5 insofar as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations 

provided for in Articles 12 to 22. 

 

Page 33 of 40 

their rights, unless so informing them may be prejudicial to the purpose of the restriction. 
Consistent  with  this,  and  in  line  with  principle  of  fairness,  the  data  controller  should  also 
inform data subjects that they are relying on (or will rely on, in the event of a particular data 
subject  right  being  exercised)  such  a  national  legislative  restriction  to  the  exercise  of  data 
subject rights, or to the transparency obligation, unless doing so would be prejudicial to the 
purpose  of  the  legislative  restriction.  As  such,  transparency  requires  data  controllers  to 
provide adequate upfront information to data subjects about their rights and any particular 
caveats to those rights which the controller may seek to rely on, so that the data subject is 
not taken by surprise at a purported restriction of a particular right when they later attempt 
to exercise it against the controller. In relation to pseudonymisation and data minimisation, 
and  insofar  as  data  controllers  may  purport  to  rely  on  Article  11  of  the  GDPR,  WP29  has 
previously confirmed in Opinion 3/ 201756 that Article 11 of the GDPR should be interpreted 
as  a  way  of  enforcing  genuine  data  minimisation  without  hindering  the  exercise  of  data 
subject rights, and that the exercise of data subject rights must be made possible with the 
help of additional information provided by the data subject.  
 
Additionally, Article 85 requires Member States, by law, to reconcile data protection with the 
right to freedom of expression and information. This  requires, amongst other things, that 
Member States provide for appropriate exemptions or derogations from certain provisions 
of  the  GDPR  (including  from  the  transparency  requirements  under  Articles  12  -  14)  for 
processing carried out for journalistic, academic, artistic or literary expression purposes, if 
they are necessary to reconcile the two rights. 

69. 

 

Transparency and data breaches 
 
70. 

WP29 has produced separate Guidelines on Data Breaches57 but for the purposes of these 
guidelines, a data controller’s obligations in relation to communication of data breaches to a 
data subject must take full account of the transparency requirements set out in Article 12.58 
The communication of a data breach must satisfy the same requirements, detailed above (in 
particular for the use of clear and plain language), that apply to any other communication 
with  a  data  subject  in  relation  to  their  rights  or  in  connection with  conveying information 
under Articles 13 and 14.
