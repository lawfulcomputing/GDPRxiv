INTRODUCTION  

 
The  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (the  GDPR)  introduces  the requirement  for a  personal  data 
breach (henceforth “breach”) to be notified to the competent national supervisory authority1 (or in the 
case of a cross-border breach, to the lead authority) and, in certain cases, to communicate the breach 
to the individuals whose personal data have been affected by the breach.  
 
Obligations to notify in cases of breaches presently exist for certain organisations, such as providers 
of publicly-available electronic communications services (as specified in Directive 2009/136/EC and 
Regulation (EU) No 611/2013)2. There are also some EU Member States that already have their own 
national breach notification obligation. This may include the obligation to notify breaches involving 
categories  of  controllers  in  addition  to  providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communication 
services (for example in Germany and Italy), or an obligation to report all breaches involving personal 
data  (such  as  in  the  Netherlands).  Other  Member  States  may  have  relevant  Codes  of  Practice  (for 
example,  in  Ireland3).  Whilst  a  number  of  EU  data  protection  authorities  currently  encourage 
controllers  to  report  breaches,  the  Data  Protection  Directive  95/46/EC4,  which  the  GDPR  replaces, 
does not contain a specific breach notification obligation and therefore such a requirement will be new 
for  many  organisations.  The  GDPR  now  makes  notification  mandatory  for  all  controllers  unless  a 
breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals5. Processors also have an 
important role to play and they must notify any breach to their controller6. 
 
The Article 29 Working Party (WP29) considers that the new notification requirement has a number 
of  benefits.  When  notifying  the  supervisory  authority,  controllers  can  obtain  advice  on  whether  the 
affected individuals need to be informed. Indeed, the supervisory authority may order the controller to 
inform  those  individuals  about  the  breach7.  Communicating  a  breach  to  individuals  allows  the 
controller to provide information  on the risks  presented as a result of the breach and the steps those 
individuals can take to protect themselves from its potential consequences. The focus of any breach 
response  plan  should  be  on  protecting  individuals  and  their  personal  data.  Consequently,  breach 
notification  should  be  seen  as  a  tool  enhancing  compliance  in  relation  to  the  protection  of  personal 
data. At the same time, it should be noted that failure to report a breach to either  an individual or a 
supervisory  authority  may  mean  that  under  Article  83  a  possible  sanction  is  applicable  to  the 
controller.

contractual relationship with subscribers) is obliged to notify the contracting provider in the event of a personal 
data breach.

Controllers and processors are therefore encouraged to plan in advance and put in place processes to 
be  able  to  detect  and  promptly  contain  a  breach,  to  assess  the  risk  to  individuals8,  and  then  to 
determine whether it is necessary to notify the competent supervisory authority, and to communicate 
the  breach  to  the  individuals  concerned  when  necessary.  Notification  to  the  supervisory  authority 
should form a part of that incident response plan.    

The GDPR contains provisions on when a breach needs to be notified, and to whom, as well as what 
information  should  be  provided  as  part  of  the  notification.  Information  required  for  the  notification 
can be provided in phases, but in any event controllers should act on any breach in a timely manner. 

In its Opinion 03/2014 on personal data breach notification9, WP29 provided guidance to controllers 
in  order  to  help  them  to  decide  whether  to  notify  data  subjects  in  case  of  a  breach.  The  opinion 
considered the obligation of providers of electronic communications regarding Directive 2002/58/EC 
and  provided  examples from  multiple sectors, in the context  of  the then  draft  GDPR,  and presented 
good practices for all controllers. 

The current Guidelines explain the mandatory breach notification and communication requirements of 
the GDPR and some of the steps controllers and processors can take to meet these new obligations. 
They also give examples of various types of breaches and who would need to be notified in different 
scenarios. 

 

I. 

Personal data breach notification under the GDPR  

A. 

Basic security considerations 

One  of  the  requirements  of  the  GDPR  is  that,  by  using  appropriate  technical  and  organisational 
measures,  personal  data  shall  be  processed  in  a  manner  to  ensure  the  appropriate  security  of  the 
personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental 
loss, destruction or damage10.  

Accordingly,  the  GDPR  requires  both  controllers  and  processors  to  have  in  place  appropriate 
technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the 
personal  data  being  processed.  They  should  take  into  account  the  state  of  the  art,  the  costs  of 
implementation and the nature, the scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of 
varying  likelihood  and  severity  for  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons11.  Also,  the  GDPR 
requires all appropriate technological protection an organisational measures to be in place to establish 
immediately  whether  a  breach  has  taken  place,  which  then  determines  whether  the  notification 
obligation is engaged12. 

Consequently,  a  key  element  of  any  data  security  policy  is  being  able,  where  possible, to  prevent  a 
breach and, where it nevertheless occurs, to react to it in a timely manner. 
                                                             
8 This can be ensured under the monitoring and review requirement of a DPIA, which is required for processing 
operations likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Article 35(1) and (11).

B. 

What is a personal data breach? 

1. 

Definition 

As  part  of  any  attempt  to address  a  breach the  controller  should  first  be  able to  recognise  one. The 
GDPR defines a “personal data breach” in Article 4(12) as: 

“a breach of security leading  to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised 
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.” 

What is meant by “destruction” of personal data should be quite clear: this is where the data no longer 
exists,  or  no  longer  exists  in  a  form  that  is  of  any  use  to  the  controller.  “Damage”  should  also  be 
relatively clear: this is where personal data has been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete. In 
terms of “loss” of personal data, this should be interpreted as the data may still exist, but the controller 
has lost control or access to it, or no longer has it in its possession. Finally, unauthorised or unlawful 
processing may include disclosure of personal data to (or access by) recipients who are not authorised 
to receive (or access) the data, or any other form of processing which violates the GDPR.  

Example 

An example of loss of personal data can include where a device containing a copy of a controller’s 
customer database has been lost or stolen. A further example of loss may be where the only copy of a 
set of personal data has been encrypted by ransomware, or has been encrypted by the controller using 
a key that is no longer in its possession. 

What should be clear is that a breach is a type of security incident. However, as indicated by Article 
4(12), the GDPR only applies  where there is a breach of  personal data. The consequence of  such a 
breach  is  that  the  controller  will  be  unable  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  principles  relating  to  the 
processing  of  personal  data  as  outlined  in  Article  5  of  the  GDPR.  This  highlights  the  difference 
between a security incident and a personal data breach – in essence, whilst all personal data breaches 
are security incidents, not all security incidents are necessarily personal data breaches13.  

The potential adverse effects of a breach on individuals are considered below. 

2. 

Types of personal data breaches 

In  its  Opinion  03/2014  on  breach  notification,  WP29  explained  that  breaches  can  be  categorised 
according to the following three well-known information security principles14:  

 

 
 

“Confidentiality  breach”  -  where  there  is  an  unauthorised  or  accidental  disclosure  of,  or 
access to, personal data. 
“Integrity breach” - where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data. 
 “Availability  breach”  -  where  there  is  an  accidental  or  unauthorised  loss  of  access15  to,  or 
destruction of, personal data. 

                                                             
13 It should be noted that a security incident is not limited to threat models where an attack is made on an 
organisation from an external source, but includes incidents from internal processing that breach security 
principles. 

14 See Opinion 03/2014 

15 It is well established that "access" is fundamentally part of "availability". See, for example, NIST SP800-
53rev4, which defines “availability” as: "Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information," 
 

7 

 

 

It  should  also  be  noted  that,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  a  breach  can  concern  confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of personal data at the same time, as well as any combination of these. 

Whereas  determining  if  there  has  been  a  breach  of  confidentiality  or  integrity  is  relatively  clear, 
whether there has been an availability breach may be less obvious. A breach will always be regarded 
as an availability breach when there has been a permanent loss of, or destruction of, personal data.   

Example 

Examples  of  a  loss  of  availability  include  where  data  has  been  deleted  either  accidentally  or  by  an 
unauthorised person, or, in the example of securely encrypted data, the decryption key has been lost. 
In the event that the controller cannot restore access to the data, for example, from a backup, then this 
is regarded as a permanent loss of availability.  

A loss of availability may also occur where there has been significant disruption to the normal service 
of  an  organisation,  for  example,  experiencing  a  power  failure  or  denial  of  service  attack,  rendering 
personal data unavailable. 

The  question  may  be  asked  whether  a  temporary  loss  of  availability  of  personal  data  should  be 
considered as a breach and, if so, one which needs to be notified. Article 32 of the GDPR, “security of 
processing,” explains that when implementing technical and organisational measures to ensure a level 
of security appropriate to the risk, consideration should be given, amongst other things, to “the ability 
to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of  processing systems and 
services,” and “the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in 
the event of a physical or technical incident”. 

Therefore, a security incident resulting in personal data being made unavailable for a period of time is 
also a type of breach, as the lack of access to the data can have a significant impact on the rights and 
freedoms  of  natural  persons. To  be  clear,  where  personal data  is  unavailable  due  to planned system 
maintenance being carried out this is not a ‘breach of security’ as defined in Article 4(12).  

As with a permanent loss or destruction of personal data (or indeed any other type of breach), a breach 
involving the temporary loss of availability  should be documented in accordance with Article 33(5). 
This assists the controller in demonstrating accountability to the supervisory authority, which may ask 
to  see  those  records16.However,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  the  breach,  it  may  or  may  not 
require  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority  and  communication  to  affected  individuals.  The 
controller will need to assess the likelihood and severity of the impact on the rights and freedoms of 
natural persons as a result of the lack of availability of personal data. In accordance with Article 33, 
the controller will need to notify unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals’ rights 
and freedoms. Of course, this will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  

Examples 

                                                                                                                                                                                              
available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf. CNSSI-4009 also refers 
to: " Timely, reliable access to data and information services for authorized users." See https://rmf.org/wp-
content/uploads/2017/10/CNSSI-4009.pdf. ISO/IEC 27000:2016 also defines “availability” as “Property of 
being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity”: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-
iec:27000:ed-4:v1:en  

16 See Article 33(5)

In the context of a hospital, if critical medical data about patients are unavailable, even temporarily, 
this could present a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms; for example, operations may be cancelled 
and lives put at risk.  

Conversely, in the case of a media company’s systems being unavailable for several hours (e.g. due to 
a power outage), if that company is then prevented from sending newsletters to its subscribers, this is 
unlikely to present a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. 

It  should  be  noted  that  although  a  loss  of  availability  of  a  controller’s  systems  might  be  only 
temporary and may not have an impact on individuals, it is important for the controller to consider all 
possible consequences of a breach, as it may still require notification for other reasons.  

Example 

Infection by ransomware (malicious software which encrypts the controller’s data until a ransom is 
paid) could lead to a temporary loss of availability if the data can be restored from backup. However, 
a network intrusion still occurred, and notification could be required if the incident is qualified as 
confidentiality breach (i.e. personal data is accessed by the attacker) and this presents a risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals.  

3. 

The possible consequences of a personal data breach 

A breach can potentially have a range of significant adverse effects on individuals, which can result in 
physical, material, or non-material damage. The GDPR explains that this can include loss of control 
over their personal data, limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, 
unauthorised  reversal  of  pseudonymisation,  damage  to  reputation,  and  loss  of  confidentiality  of 
personal data protected by professional secrecy. It can also include any other significant economic or 
social disadvantage to those individuals17. 

Accordingly,  the  GDPR  requires  the  controller  to  notify  a  breach  to  the  competent  supervisory 
authority, unless it is unlikely to result in a risk of such adverse effects taking place. Where there is a 
likely high risk of these adverse effects occurring, the GDPR requires the controller to communicate 
the breach to the affected individuals as soon as is reasonably feasible18. 

The importance of being able to identify a breach, to assess the risk to individuals, and then  notify if 
required, is emphasised in Recital 87 of the GDPR: 

“It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures 
have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and 
to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject. The fact that the notification was 
made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the nature and 
gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such 
notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and 
powers laid down in this Regulation.”  

Further guidelines on assessing the risk of adverse effects to individuals are considered in section IV.  
 
If controllers fail to notify either the supervisory authority or data subjects of a data breach or both 
even though the requirements of Articles 33 and/or 34 are fulfilled, then the supervisory authority is

presented with a choice that must include consideration of all of the corrective measures at its 
disposal, which would include consideration of the imposition of the appropriate administrative fine19, 
either accompanying a corrective measure under Article 58(2) or on its own. Where an administrative 
fine is chosen, its value can be up to 10,000,000 EUR or up to 2 % if the total worldwide annual 
turnover of an undertaking under Article 83(4)(a) of the GDPR. It is also important to bear in mind 
that in some cases, the failure to notify a breach could reveal either an absence of existing security 
measures or an inadequacy of the existing security measures. The WP29 guidelines on administrative 
fines state: “The occurrence of several different infringements committed together in any particular 
single case means that the supervisory authority is able to apply the administrative fines at a level 
which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive within the limit of the gravest infringement”. In that 
case, the supervisory authority will also have the possibility to issue sanctions for failure to notify or 
communicate the breach (Articles 33 and 34) on the one hand, and absence of (adequate) security 
measures (Article 32) on the other hand, as they are two separate infringements.   
 
 

II. 

Article 33 - Notification to the supervisory authority 

A. 

When to notify 

1. 

Article 33 requirements 

Article 33(1) provides that: 

“In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, 
not  later  than  72  hours  after  having  become  aware  of  it,  notify  the  personal  data  breach  to  the 
supervisory  authority  competent  in  accordance  with  Article  55,  unless  the  personal  data  breach  is 
unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the 
supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.” 

Recital 87 states20: 

“It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures 
have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and 
to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject. The fact that the notification was 
made  without  undue  delay  should  be  established  taking  into  account  in  particular  the  nature  and 
gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such 
notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and 
powers laid down in this Regulation.” 

2. 

When does a controller become “aware”? 

As  detailed  above,  the  GDPR  requires  that,  in  the  case  of  a  breach,  the  controller  shall  notify  the 
breach without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of 
it. This may raise the question of when a controller can be considered to have become “aware” of a 
breach.  WP29  considers  that  a  controller  should  be  regarded  as  having  become  “aware”  when  that

controller  has  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty  that  a  security  incident  has  occurred  that  has  led  to 
personal data being compromised.  

However, as indicated earlier, the GDPR requires the controller to implement all appropriate technical 
protection and organisational measures to establish immediately whether a breach has taken place and 
to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subjects. It also states that the fact that the 
notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the 
nature and gravity of the breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject21. This 
puts  an  obligation  on  the  controller to  ensure that  they  will  be  “aware”  of  any  breaches in  a  timely 
manner so that they can take appropriate action. 

When, exactly, a controller can be considered to be “aware” of a particular breach will depend on the 
circumstances  of  the  specific  breach.  In  some  cases,  it  will  be  relatively  clear  from  the  outset  that 
there has been a breach, whereas in others, it may take some time to establish if personal data have 
been compromised. However, the emphasis should be on prompt action to investigate an incident to 
determine  whether  personal  data  have  indeed  been  breached,  and  if  so,  to  take  remedial  action  and 
notify if required. 

Examples 
 
1.  In  the  case  of  a  loss  of  a  USB  key  with  unencrypted  personal  data  it  is  often  not  possible  to 
ascertain  whether  unauthorised  persons  gained  access  to  that  data.  Nevertheless,  even  though  the 
controller may not be able to establish if a confidentiality breach has taken place, such a case has to be 
notified  as  there  is  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty  that  an  availability  breach  has  occurred;  the 
controller would become “aware” when it realised the USB key had been lost.    

2. A third party informs a controller that they have accidentally received the personal data of one of its 
customers and provides evidence of the unauthorised disclosure. As the controller has been presented 
with clear evidence of a confidentiality breach then there can be no doubt that it has become “aware”. 

3. A controller detects that there has been a possible intrusion into its network. The controller checks 
its  systems  to  establish  whether  personal  data  held  on  that  system  has  been  compromised  and 
confirms this is the case. Once again, as the controller now has clear evidence of a breach there can be 
no doubt that it has become “aware”. 

4. A cybercriminal contacts the controller after having hacked its system in order to ask for a ransom. 
In that case, after checking its system to confirm it has been attacked the controller has clear evidence 
that a breach has occurred and there is no doubt that it has become aware. 

After  first  being  informed  of  a  potential  breach  by  an  individual,  a  media  organisation,  or  another 
source, or when it has itself detected a security incident, the controller may undertake a short period of 
investigation in order to establish whether or not a breach has in fact occurred. During this period of 
investigation  the  controller  may  not  be  regarded  as  being  “aware”.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the 
initial  investigation  should  begin  as  soon  as  possible  and  establish  with  a  reasonable  degree  of 
certainty whether a breach has taken place; a more detailed investigation can then follow.  

Once the controller has become aware, a notifiable breach must be notified without undue delay, and 
where feasible, not later than 72 hours. During this period, the controller should assess the likely risk 
to  individuals  in  order  to  determine  whether  the  requirement  for  notification  has  been  triggered,  as 
well as the action(s) needed to address the breach. However, a controller may already have an initial 
assessment  of  the  potential  risk  that  could  result  from  a  breach  as  part  of  a  data  protection  impact

assessment  (DPIA)22  made  prior  to  carrying  out  the  processing  operation  concerned.  However,  the 
DPIA may be more generalised in comparison to the specific circumstances of any actual breach, and 
so  in  any  event  an  additional  assessment  taking  into  account  those  circumstances  will  need  to  be 
made. For more detail on assessing risk, see section IV.  

In most cases these preliminary actions should be completed soon after the initial alert (i.e. when the 
controller or processor suspects there has been a security incident which may involve personal data.) – 
it should take longer than this only in exceptional cases. 

Example 

An  individual  informs  the  controller  that  they  have  received  an  email  impersonating  the  controller 
which contains personal data relating to his (actual) use of the controller’s service, suggesting that the 
security  of  the  controller  has  been  compromised.  The  controller  conducts  a  short  period  of 
investigation  and  identifies  an  intrusion  into  their  network  and  evidence  of  unauthorised  access  to 
personal data. The controller would now be considered as “aware” and notification to the supervisory 
authority is required unless this is unlikely to present a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. 
The controller will need to take appropriate remedial action to address the breach. 

The  controller  should  therefore  have  internal  processes  in  place  to  be  able  to  detect  and  address  a 
breach. For example, for finding some irregularities in data processing the controller or processor may 
use certain technical measures such as data flow and log analysers, from which is possible to define 
events  and  alerts  by  correlating  any  log  data23.  It  is  important  that  when  a  breach  is  detected  it  is 
reported  upwards  to  the  appropriate  level  of  management  so  it  can  be  addressed  and,  if  required, 
notified  in  accordance  with  Article  33  and,  if  necessary,  Article  34.  Such  measures  and  reporting 
mechanisms  could  be  detailed  in  the  controller’s  incident  response  plans  and/or  governance 
arrangements.  These  will  help  the  controller  to  plan  effectively  and  determine  who  has  operational 
responsibility  within  the  organisation  for  managing  a  breach  and  how  or  whether  to  escalate  an 
incident as appropriate. 

The controller should also have in place arrangements with any processors the controller uses, which 
themselves have an obligation to notify the controller in the event of a breach (see below).  

Whilst it is the responsibility of controllers and processors to put in place suitable measures to be able 
to prevent, react and address a breach, there are some practical steps that should be taken in all cases. 

 

Information concerning all security-related events should be directed towards a responsible 
person or persons with the task of addressing incidents, establishing the existence of a breach 
and assessing risk. 

  Risk to individuals as a result of a breach should then be assessed (likelihood of no risk, risk 

or high risk), with relevant sections of the organisation being informed. 

  Notification to the supervisory authority, and potentially communication of the breach to the 

affected individuals should be made, if required. 

  At the same time, the controller should act to contain and recover the breach. 
  Documentation of the breach should take place as it develops. 

Accordingly, it should be clear that there is an obligation on the controller to act on any initial alert 
and  establish  whether  or  not  a  breach  has,  in  fact,  occurred.  This  brief  period  allows  for  some 
                                                             
22 See WP29 Guidelines on DPIAs here: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44137    

23 It should be noted that log data facilitating auditability of, e.g., storage, modifications or erasure of data may 
also qualify as personal data relating to the person who initiated the respective processing operation.

investigation, and for the controller to gather evidence and other relevant details. However, once the 
controller  has  established  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty  that  a  breach  has  occurred,  if  the 
conditions in Article 33(1) have been met, it must then notify the supervisory authority without undue 
delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours24. If a controller fails to act in a timely manner and it 
becomes apparent that a breach did occur, this could be considered as a failure to notify in accordance 
with Article 33. 

Article  32  makes  clear  that  the  controller  and  processor  should  have  appropriate  technical  and 
organisational measures in place to ensure an appropriate level of security of personal data: the ability 
to detect, address, and report a breach in a timely manner should be seen as essential elements of these 
measures.  

3. 

Joint controllers 

Article 26 concerns joint controllers and specifies that joint controllers shall determine their respective 
responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR25. This will include determining which party will have 
responsibility for  complying with the obligations under Articles 33 and 34. WP29 recommends that 
the  contractual  arrangements  between  joint  controllers  include  provisions  that  determine  which 
controller will take the lead on, or be responsible for, compliance with the GDPR’s breach notification 
obligations.  

4. 

Processor obligations 

The controller retains overall responsibility for the protection of personal data, but the processor has 
an  important  role  to  play  to  enable  the  controller  to  comply  with  its  obligations;  and  this  includes 
breach  notification.  Indeed,  Article  28(3)  specifies  that  the  processing  by  a  processor  shall  be 
governed  by  a  contract  or  other  legal  act.  Article  28(3)(f)  states  that  the  contract  or  other  legal  act 
shall stipulate that the  processor   “assists the controller in ensuring  compliance with the  obligations 
pursuant  to  Articles  32  to  36  taking  into  account  the  nature  of  processing  and  the  information 
available to the processor”.  

Article  33(2)  makes  it  clear  that  if  a  processor  is  used  by  a  controller  and  the  processor  becomes 
aware of a breach of the personal data it is processing on behalf of the controller, it must notify the 
controller “without undue delay”. It should be noted that the processor does not need to first assess the 
likelihood of risk arising  from a breach before notifying the controller; it is the controller that must 
make this assessment on becoming aware of the breach. The processor just needs to establish whether 
a breach has occurred and then notify the controller. The controller uses the processor to achieve its 
purposes;  therefore,  in  principle,  the  controller  should  be  considered  as  “aware”  once  the  processor 
has  informed  it  of  the  breach.  The  obligation  on  the  processor  to  notify  its  controller  allows  the 
controller to address the breach and to determine whether or not it is required to notify the supervisory 
authority  in  accordance  with  Article  33(1)  and  the  affected  individuals  in  accordance  with  Article 
34(1).  The  controller  might  also  want  to  investigate  the  breach,  as  the  processor  might  not  be  in  a 
position  to  know  all  the  relevant  facts  relating  to  the  matter,  for  example,  if  a  copy  or  backup  of 
personal data destroyed or lost by the processor is still held by the controller. This may affect whether 
the controller would then need to notify.  

The  GDPR  does  not  provide  an  explicit  time  limit  within  which  the  processor  must  alert  the 
controller,  except  that  it  must  do  so  “without  undue  delay”.  Therefore,  WP29  recommends  the 

                                                             
24 See Regulation No 1182/71 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits, available at: 
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31971R1182&from=EN  

25 See also Recital 79. 

 

13 

 

processor  promptly  notifies  the  controller,  with  further  information  about  the  breach  provided  in 
phases as more details become available. This is important in order to help the controller to meet the 
requirement of notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.  

As  is  explained  above,  the  contract  between  the  controller  and  processor  should  specify  how  the 
requirements expressed in Article 33(2) should be met in addition to other provisions in the GDPR. 
This  can  include  requirements  for  early  notification  by  the  processor  that  in  turn  support  the 
controller’s obligations to report to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.    

Where  the  processor  provides  services  to  multiple  controllers  that  are  all  affected  by  the  same 
incident, the processor will have to report details of the incident to each controller. 

A  processor  could  make  a  notification  on  behalf  of  the  controller,  if  the  controller  has  given  the 
processor the proper authorisation and this is part of the contractual arrangements between controller 
and processor. Such notification must be made in accordance with Article 33 and 34. However, it is 
important to note that the legal responsibility to notify remains with the controller. 

B. 

Providing information to the supervisory authority 

1. 

Information to be provided 

When  a  controller  notifies  a  breach  to  the  supervisory  authority,  Article  33(3)  states  that,  at  the 
minimum, it should: 

“(a)  describe  the  nature  of  the  personal  data  breach  including  where  possible,  the  categories  and 
approximate  number  of  data  subjects  concerned  and  the  categories  and  approximate  number  of 
personal data records concerned;  

(b)  communicate  the  name  and  contact  details  of  the  data  protection  officer  or  other  contact  point 
where more information can be obtained;  

(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;  

(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data 
breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.” 

The  GDPR  does  not  define  categories  of  data  subjects  or  personal  data  records.  However,  WP29 
suggests  categories  of  data  subjects  to  refer  to the  various  types  of individuals whose  personal  data 
has been affected by a breach: depending on the descriptors used, this could include, amongst others, 
children  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  people  with  disabilities,  employees  or  customers.  Similarly, 
categories of personal data records can refer to the different types of records that the controller may 
process,  such  as  health  data,  educational  records,  social  care  information,  financial  details,  bank 
account numbers, passport numbers and so on. 

Recital  85  makes  it  clear  that  one  of  the  purposes  of  notification  is  limiting  damage  to  individuals. 
Accordingly,  if  the  types  of  data  subjects  or  the  types  of  personal  data  indicate  a  risk  of  particular 
damage occurring as a result of a breach (e.g. identity theft, fraud, financial loss, threat to professional 
secrecy), then it is important the notification indicates these categories. In this way, it is linked to the 
requirement of describing the likely consequences of the breach. 

Where  precise  information  is  not  available  (e.g.  exact  number  of  data  subjects affected) this  should 
not be a barrier to timely breach notification. The GDPR allows for approximations to be made in the 
number of individuals affected and the number of personal data records concerned. The focus should 
be directed towards addressing the adverse effects of the breach rather than providing precise figures. 

14 

 

 

Thus, when it has become clear that here has been a breach, but the extent of it is not yet known, a 
notification in phases (see below) is a safe way to meet the notification obligations.  

Article 33(3) states that the controller “shall at least” provide this information with a notification, so a 
controller  can,  if  necessary,  choose  to  provide  further  details.  Different  types  of  breaches 
(confidentiality,  integrity  or  availability)  might  require  further  information  to  be  provided  to  fully 
explain the circumstances of each case. 

Example 

As  part  of  its  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority,  a  controller  may  find  it  useful  to  name  its 
processor if it is at the root cause of a breach, particularly if  this has led to an incident affecting the 
personal data records of many other controllers that use the same processor. 

In  any  event,  the supervisory  authority  may  request  further  details  as  part of its  investigation  into  a 
breach. 

2. 

Notification in phases 

Depending  on  the  nature  of  a  breach,  further  investigation  by  the  controller  may  be  necessary  to 
establish all of the relevant facts relating to the incident. Article 33(4) therefore states: 

“Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information 
may be provided in phases without undue further delay.” 

This  means  that  the  GDPR  recognises  that  controllers  will  not  always  have  all  of  the  necessary 
information concerning a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, as full and comprehensive 
details of the incident may not always be available during this initial period. As such, it allows for a 
notification in phases. It is more likely this will be the case for more complex breaches, such as some 
types  of  cyber  security  incidents  where,  for  example,  an  in-depth  forensic  investigation  may  be 
necessary to fully establish the nature of the breach and the extent to which personal data have been 
compromised.  Consequently,  in  many  cases  the  controller  will  have  to  do  more  investigation  and 
follow-up  with  additional  information  at  a  later  point.  This  is  permissible,  providing  the  controller 
gives  reasons  for  the  delay,  in  accordance  with  Article  33(1).  WP29  recommends  that  when  the 
controller  first  notifies  the  supervisory  authority,  the  controller  should  also  inform  the  supervisory 
authority if the controller does not yet have all the required information and will provide more details 
later  on.  The  supervisory  authority  should  agree  how  and  when  additional  information  should  be 
provided. This does not prevent the controller from providing further information at any other stage, if 
it  becomes  aware  of  additional  relevant  details  about  the  breach  that  need  to  be  provided  to  the 
supervisory authority. 

The  focus  of  the  notification  requirement  is  to  encourage  controllers  to  act  promptly  on  a  breach, 
contain it and, if possible, recover the  compromised personal data, and to seek relevant advice from 
the supervisory authority. Notifying the supervisory authority within the first 72 hours can allow the 
controller to make sure that decisions about notifying or not notifying individuals are correct. 

However,  the  purpose  of  notifying  the  supervisory  authority  is  not  solely  to  obtain  guidance  on 
whether to notify the affected individuals. It will be obvious in some cases that, due to the nature of 
the  breach  and  the  severity  of  the  risk,  the  controller  will  need  to  notify  the  affected  individuals 
without delay. For example, if there is an immediate threat of identity theft, or if special categories of 
personal  data26  are  disclosed  online,  the  controller  should  act  without  undue  delay  to  contain  the 
                                                             
26 See Article 9.

breach  and  to  communicate  it  to  the  individuals  concerned  (see  section  III).  In  exceptional 
circumstances, this might even take place before notifying the supervisory authority. More generally, 
notification of the supervisory authority may not serve as a justification for failure to communicate the 
breach to the data subject where it is required.  

It  should  also  be  clear  that  after  making  an  initial  notification,  a  controller  could  update  the 
supervisory  authority  if  a  follow-up  investigation  uncovers  evidence  that  the  security  incident  was 
contained and no breach actually occurred. This information could then be added to the information 
already given to the supervisory authority and the incident recorded accordingly as not being a breach. 
There is no penalty for reporting an incident that ultimately transpires not to be a breach.  

Example 

A controller notifies the supervisory authority within 72 hours of detecting a breach that it has lost a 
USB key containing a copy of the personal data of some of its customers. The USB key is later found 
misfiled  within  the  controller’s  premises  and  recovered.  The  controller  updates  the  supervisory 
authority and requests the notification be amended. 

It  should  be  noted  that  a  phased  approach  to  notification  is  already  the  case  under  the  existing 
obligations of Directive 2002/58/EC, Regulation 611/2013 and other self-reported incidents. 

3. 

Delayed notifications 

Article 33(1) makes it clear that where notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 
hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. This, along with the concept of notification in 
phases, recognises that a controller may not always be able to notify a breach within that time period, 
and that a delayed notification may be permissible. 

Such  a  scenario  might  take  place  where,  for  example,  a  controller  experiences  multiple,  similar 
confidentiality  breaches  over  a  short  period  of  time,  affecting  large  numbers  of  data  subjects  in  the 
same way. A controller could become aware of a breach and, whilst beginning its investigation, and 
before  notification,  detect  further  similar  breaches,  which  have  different  causes.  Depending  on  the 
circumstances, it may take the controller some time to establish the extent of the breaches and, rather 
than  notify  each  breach  individually,  the  controller  instead  organises  a  meaningful  notification  that 
represents several very similar breaches, with possible different causes. This could lead to notification 
to  the  supervisory  authority  being  delayed  by  more  than  72  hours  after  the  controller  first  becomes 
aware of these breaches. 

Strictly  speaking,  each  individual  breach  is  a  reportable  incident.  However,  to  avoid  being  overly 
burdensome,  the  controller  may  be  able  to  submit  a  “bundled”  notification  representing  all  these 
breaches, provided that they concern the same type of personal data breached in the same way, over a 
relatively  short  space  of  time.  If  a  series  of  breaches  take  place  that  concern  different  types  of 
personal data,  breached  in different  ways,  then  notification  should  proceed  in  the  normal  way,  with 
each breach being reported in accordance with Article 33.  

Whilst the GDPR allows for delayed notifications to an extent, this should not be seen as something 
that  regularly  takes  place.  It  is  worth  pointing  out  that  bundled  notifications  can  also  be  made  for 
multiple similar breaches reported within 72 hours. 

C. 

Cross-border breaches and breaches at non-EU establishments  

1. 

Cross-border breaches 

 

16 

 

Where there is cross-border processing27 of personal data, a breach may affect data subjects in more 
than one Member State. Article 33(1) makes it clear that when a breach has occurred, the controller 
should  notify  the  supervisory  authority  competent  in  accordance  with  Article  55  of  the  GDPR28. 
Article 55(1) says that: 

“Each supervisory authority shall be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the 
exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation on the territory of its own 
Member State.” 

However, Article 56(1) states: 

“Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single 
establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for 
the  cross-border  processing  carried  out  by  that  controller  or  processor  in  accordance  with  the 
procedure provided in Article 60.” 

Furthermore, Article 56(6) states: 

“The  lead  supervisory  authority  shall  be  the  sole  interlocutor  of  the  controller  or  processor  for  the 
cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor.” 

This  means  that  whenever  a  breach  takes  place  in  the  context  of  cross-border  processing  and 
notification is required, the controller will need to notify the  lead supervisory authority29. Therefore, 
when drafting its breach response plan, a controller must make an assessment as to which supervisory 
authority is the lead supervisory authority that it will need to notify30. This will allow the controller to 
respond promptly to a breach and to meet its obligations in respect of Article 33. It should be clear 
that in the event of a breach involving cross-border processing, notification must be made to the lead 
supervisory authority, which is not necessarily where the affected data subjects are located, or indeed 
where the  breach  has  taken  place. When  notifying  the  lead  authority,  the  controller  should  indicate, 
where appropriate, whether the breach involves establishments located in other Member States, and in 
which Member States data subjects are likely to have been affected by the breach. If the controller has 
any doubt as to the identity of the lead supervisory authority then it should, at a minimum, notify the 
local supervisory authority where the breach has taken place.  

2. 

Breaches at non-EU establishments 

Article  3  concerns the  territorial  scope  of  the  GDPR, including  when it  applies to  the  processing  of 
personal data by a controller or processor that is not established in the EU. In particular, Article 3(2) 
states31: 

                                                             
27 See Article 4(23) 

28 See also Recital 122.

http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44102

“This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a 
controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:  

(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, 
to such data subjects in the Union; or  

(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.” 

Article 3(3) is also relevant and states32: 

“This  Regulation  applies  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  a  controller  not  established  in  the 
Union, but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law.” 

Where a controller not established in the EU is subject to Article 3(2) or Article 3(3) and experiences 
a breach, it is therefore still bound by the notification obligations under Articles 33 and 34. Article 27 
requires  a  controller  (and  processor)  to  designate  a  representative  in  the  EU  where  Article  3(2) 
applies.  In  such  cases,  WP29  recommends  that  notification  should  be  made  to  the  supervisory 
authority  in  the  Member  State  where  the  controller’s  representative  in  the  EU  is  established33. 
Similarly,  where  a  processor  is  subject  to  Article  3(2),  it  will  be  bound  by  the  obligations  on 
processors,  of  particular  relevance  here,  the  duty  to  notify  a  breach  to  the  controller  under  Article 
33(2). 

D. 

Conditions where notification is not required  

Article  33(1)  makes  it  clear  that  breaches  that  are  “unlikely  to  result  in  a  risk  to  the  rights  and 
freedoms  of  natural  persons”  do  not  require  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority.  An  example 
might be where personal data are already publically available and a disclosure of such data does not 
constitute a likely risk to the individual. This is in contrast to existing breach notification requirements 
for  providers  of  publically  available  electronic  communications  services  in  Directive  2009/136/EC 
that state all relevant breaches have to be notified to the competent authority.  

In  its  Opinion  03/2014  on  breach  notification34,  WP29  explained  that  a  confidentiality  breach  of 
personal data that were encrypted with a state of the art algorithm is still a personal data breach, and 
has  to  be  notified.  However,  if  the  confidentiality  of  the  key  is  intact  –  i.e.,  the  key  was  not 
compromised in any security breach, and was generated so that it cannot be ascertained by available 
technical  means  by  any  person  who  is  not  authorised  to  access  it  –  then  the  data  are  in  principle 
unintelligible.  Thus,  the  breach  is  unlikely  to  adversely  affect  individuals  and  therefore  would  not 
require  communication  to  those  individuals35.  However,  even  where  data  is  encrypted,  a  loss  or 
alteration  can  have  negative  consequences  for  data  subjects  where  the  controller  has  no  adequate 
backups. In that instance communication to data subjects would be required, even if the data itself was 
subject to adequate encryption measures.  

                                                             
32 See also Recital 25 

33 See Recital 80 and Article 27 

34 WP29, Opinion 03/2014 on breach notification, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-
29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf  

35 See also Article 4(1) and (2) of Regulation 611/2013. 

 

18 

 

WP29  also  explained  this  would  similarly  be  the  case  if  personal  data,  such  as  passwords,  were 
securely hashed and salted, the hashed value was calculated with a state of the art cryptographic keyed 
hash function, the key used to hash the data was not compromised in any breach, and the key used to 
hash  the  data  has  been  generated  in  a  way  that  it  cannot  be  ascertained  by  available  technological 
means by any person who is not authorised to access it. 

Consequently, if personal data have been made essentially unintelligible to  unauthorised parties and 
where  the  data  are  a  copy  or  a  backup  exists,  a  confidentiality  breach  involving  properly  encrypted 
personal data may not need to be notified to the supervisory authority. This is because such a breach is 
unlikely to pose a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. This of course means that  the individual 
would not need to be informed either as there is likely no high risk. However, it should be borne in 
mind  that  while  notification  may  initially  not  be  required  if  there  is  no  likely  risk  to  the  rights  and 
freedoms of individuals, this may change over time and the risk would have to be re-evaluated. For 
example,  if  the  key  is  subsequently  found  to  be  compromised,  or  a  vulnerability  in  the  encryption 
software is exposed, then notification may still be required.   

Furthermore, it should be noted that if there is a breach where there are no backups of the encrypted 
personal data then there will have been an availability breach, which could pose risks to individuals 
and  therefore  may  require  notification.  Similarly,  where  a  breach  occurs  involving  the  loss  of 
encrypted  data,  even  if  a  backup  of  the  personal  data  exists  this  may  still  be  a  reportable  breach, 
depending on the length of time taken to restore the data from that backup and the effect that lack of 
availability  has on individuals.  As  Article  32(1)(c)  states,  an important factor  of  security  is  the “the 
ability  to  restore  the  availability  and  access  to  personal  data  in  a  timely  manner  in  the  event  of  a 
physical or technical incident”. 

Example 

A  breach  that  would  not  require  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority  would  be  the  loss  of  a 
securely encrypted mobile device, utilised by the controller and its staff. Provided the encryption key 
remains within the secure possession of the controller and this is not the sole copy of the personal data 
then the personal data would be inaccessible to an attacker. This means the breach is unlikely to result 
in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects in question. If it later becomes evident that the 
encryption key was compromised or that the encryption software or algorithm is vulnerable, then the 
risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons  will  change  and  thus  notification  may  now  be 
required. 

However,  a  failure  to  comply  with  Article  33  will  exist  where  a  controller  does  not  notify  the 
supervisory  authority  in  a  situation  where  the  data  has  not  actually  been  securely  encrypted. 
Therefore, when selecting encryption software controllers should carefully weigh the quality  and the 
proper  implementation  of  the  encryption  offered,  understand  what  level  of  protection  it  actually 
provides  and  whether  this  is  appropriate  to  the  risks  presented.  Controllers  should  also  be  familiar 
with the specifics of how their encryption product functions. For instance, a device may be encrypted 
once  it  is  switched  off,  but  not  while  it  is  in  stand-by  mode.  Some  products  using  encryption  have 
“default keys” that need to be changed by each customer to be effective. The encryption may also be 
considered  currently  adequate  by  security  experts,  but  may  become  outdated  in  a  few  years’  time, 
meaning  it  is  questionable  whether  the  data  would  be  sufficiently  encrypted  by  that  product  and 
provide an appropriate level of protection. 

 

III. 

Article 34 – Communication to the data subject 

A. 

Informing individuals 

 

19 

 

In  certain  cases,  as  well  as  notifying  the  supervisory  authority,  the  controller  is  also  required  to 
communicate a breach to the affected individuals.  

Article 34(1) states: 

“When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural 
persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue 
delay.” 

Controllers  should  recall  that  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority  is  mandatory  unless  there  is 
unlikely  to  be  a  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  individuals  as  a  result  of  a  breach.  In  addition, 
where  there  is  likely  a  high  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  individuals  as  the  result  of  a  breach, 
individuals  must  also  be  informed.  The  threshold  for  communicating  a  breach  to  individuals  is 
therefore  higher  than  for  notifying  supervisory  authorities  and  not  all  breaches  will  therefore  be 
required  to  be  communicated  to  individuals,  thus  protecting  them  from  unnecessary  notification 
fatigue.   

The  GDPR  states  that  communication  of  a  breach  to  individuals  should  be  made  “without  undue 
delay,”  which  means  as  soon  as  possible.    The  main  objective  of  notification  to  individuals  is  to 
provide  specific  information  about  steps  they  should  take  to  protect  themselves36.  As  noted  above, 
depending on the nature of the breach and the risk posed, timely communication will help individuals 
to take steps to protect themselves from any negative consequences of the breach.  

Annex  B  of  these  Guidelines  provides  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  examples  of  when  a  breach  may  be 
likely to result in high risk to individuals and consequently instances when a controller will have to 
notify a breach to those affected. 

B. 

Information to be provided 

When notifying individuals, Article 34(2) specifies that: 

“The  communication  to  the  data  subject  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article  shall  describe  in 
clear  and  plain  language  the  nature  of  the  personal  data  breach  and  contain  at  least the  information 
and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).” 

According to this provision, the controller should at least provide the following information: 

 
 
 
 

a description of the nature of the breach; 
the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point;  
a description of the likely consequences of the breach; and  
a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the 
breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. 

As an example of the measures taken to address the breach and to mitigate its possible adverse effects, 
the controller  could state  that,  after  having  notified  the  breach to the  relevant  supervisory  authority, 
the  controller  has  received  advice  on  managing  the  breach  and  lessening  its  impact.  The  controller 
should  also,  where  appropriate,  provide  specific  advice  to  individuals  to  protect  themselves  from 
possible  adverse  consequences  of  the  breach,  such  as  resetting  passwords  in  the  case  where  their 
access credentials have been compromised. Again, a controller can choose to provide information in 
addition to what is required here.   

                                                             
36 See also Recital 86.

C. 

Contacting individuals 

In principle, the relevant breach should be communicated to the affected data subjects directly, unless 
doing  so  would  involve  a  disproportionate  effort.  In  such  a  case,  there  shall  instead  be  a  public 
communication  or  similar  measure  whereby  the  data  subjects  are  informed  in  an  equally  effective 
manner (Article 34(3)c). 

Dedicated messages should be used when  communicating a breach to  data subjects and they should 
not  be sent  with  other  information, such  as  regular  updates, newsletters,  or  standard  messages. This 
helps to make the communication of the breach to be clear and transparent. 

Examples  of  transparent  communication  methods  include  direct  messaging  (e.g.  email,  SMS,  direct 
message),  prominent  website  banners  or  notification,  postal  communications  and  prominent 
advertisements in print media. A notification solely confined within a press release or corporate blog 
would not be an effective means of communicating a breach to an individual. WP29 recommends that 
controllers should choose a means that maximizes the chance of properly communicating information 
to  all  affected  individuals.  Depending  on  the  circumstances,  this  may  mean  the  controller  employs 
several methods of communication, as opposed to using a single contact channel.    

Controllers  may  also  need  to  ensure  that  the  communication  is  accessible  in  appropriate  alternative 
formats  and  relevant  languages  to  ensure  individuals  are  able  to  understand  the  information  being 
provided  to  them.  For  example,  when  communicating  a  breach  to  an  individual,  the  language  used 
during  the  previous  normal  course  of  business  with  the  recipient  will  generally  be  appropriate. 
However, if the breach affects data subjects who the controller has not previously interacted with, or 
particularly  those  who  reside  in  a  different  Member  State  or  other  non-EU  country  from  where  the 
controller  is  established,  communication  in  the  local  national  language  could  be  acceptable,  taking 
into account the resource required. The key is to help data subjects understand the nature of the breach 
and steps they can take to protect themselves. 

Controllers  are  best  placed  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  contact  channel  to  communicate  a 
breach to individuals, particularly if they interact with their customers on a frequent basis. However, 
clearly  a  controller  should  be  wary  of  using  a  contact  channel  compromised  by  the  breach  as  this 
channel could also be used by attackers impersonating the controller.  

At the same time, Recital 86 explains that:  

“Such  communications  to data  subjects  should  be  made  as  soon  as  reasonably  feasible and  in  close 
cooperation  with  the  supervisory  authority,  respecting  guidance  provided  by  it  or  by  other  relevant 
authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk 
of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement 
appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for 
communication.” 

Controllers  might  therefore  wish  to  contact  and  consult  the  supervisory  authority  not  only  to  seek 
advice  about  informing  data  subjects  about  a  breach  in  accordance  with  Article  34,  but  also  on  the 
appropriate messages to be sent to, and the most appropriate way to contact, individuals.  

Linked to this is the advice given in Recital 88 that notification of a breach should “take into account 
the  legitimate  interests  of  law-enforcement  authorities  where  early  disclosure  could  unnecessarily 
hamper  the  investigation  of  the  circumstances  of  a  personal  data  breach”.  This  may  mean  that  in 
certain  circumstances,  where  justified,  and  on  the  advice  of  law-enforcement  authorities,  the 
controller may delay communicating the breach to the affected individuals until such time as it would 
not  prejudice  such  investigations.  However,  data  subjects  would  still  need  to  be  promptly  informed 
after this time. 

21 

 

 

Whenever it is not possible for the controller to communicate a breach to an individual because there 
is  insufficient  data  stored  to  contact  the  individual,  in  that  particular  circumstance  the  controller 
should  inform  the  individual  as  soon  as  it  is  reasonably  feasible  to  do  so  (e.g.  when  an  individual 
exercises  their  Article  15  right  to  access  personal  data  and  provides  the  controller  with  necessary 
additional information to contact them). 

D. 

Conditions where communication is not required 

Article 34(3) states three conditions that, if met, do not require notification to individuals in the event 
of a breach. These are: 

 

  The  controller  has  applied  appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures  to  protect 
personal  data  prior  to  the  breach,  in  particular  those  measures  that  render  personal  data 
unintelligible  to  any  person  who  is  not  authorised  to  access  it.  This  could,  for  example, 
include protecting personal data with state-of-the-art encryption, or by tokenization. 
Immediately  following  a  breach,  the  controller  has  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  the  high  risk 
posed  to  individuals’  rights  and  freedoms  is  no  longer  likely  to  materialise.  For  example, 
depending  on  the  circumstances  of  the case, the  controller  may  have  immediately  identified 
and taken action against the individual who has accessed personal data before they were able 
to do anything with it. Due regard still needs to be given to the possible consequences of any 
breach of confidentiality, again, depending on the nature of the data concerned.   
It would involve disproportionate effort37 to contact individuals, perhaps where their contact 
details  have  been  lost  as  a  result  of  the  breach  or  are  not  known  in  the  first  place.  For 
example,  the  warehouse  of  a  statistical  office  has  flooded  and  the  documents  containing 
personal  data  were  stored  only  in  paper  form.  Instead,  the  controller  must  make  a  public 
communication or take a similar measure, whereby the individuals are informed in an equally 
effective manner. In the case of disproportionate effort, technical arrangements could also be 
envisaged  to  make  information  about  the  breach  available  on  demand,  which  could  prove 
useful  to  those  individuals  who  may  be  affected  by  a  breach,  but  the  controller  cannot 
otherwise contact.  

 

In  accordance  with  the  accountability  principle  controllers  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  to  the 
supervisory authority that they meet one or more of these conditions 38.  It should be borne in mind that 
while notification may initially not be required if there is no risk to the rights and freedoms of natural 
persons, this may change over time and the risk would have to be re-evaluated. 

If a controller decides not to communicate a breach to the individual, Article 34(4) explains that the 
supervisory authority can require it to do so, if it considers the breach is likely to result in a high risk 
to  individuals.  Alternatively,  it  may  consider  that  the  conditions  in  Article  34(3)  have  been  met  in 
which case notification to individuals is not required. If the supervisory authority determines that the 
decision  not  to  notify  data  subjects  is  not  well  founded,  it  may  consider  employing  its  available 
powers and sanctions.

Assessing risk and high risk 

A. 

Risk as a trigger for notification 

                                                             
37 See WP29 Guidelines on transparency, which will consider the issue of disproportionate effort, available at 
http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?doc_id=48850 

38 See Article 5(2) 

 

22 

 

Although the GDPR introduces the obligation to notify a breach, it is not a requirement to do so in all 
circumstances:  

  Notification to the competent supervisory authority is required unless a breach is unlikely to 

result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. 

  Communication of a breach to the individual is only triggered where it is likely to result in a 

high risk to their rights and freedoms.  

This  means  that  immediately  upon  becoming  aware  of  a  breach,  it  is  vitally  important  that  the 
controller  should  not  only  seek  to  contain  the  incident  but  it  should  also  assess  the  risk  that  could 
result  from  it.  There  are  two  important  reasons  for  this:  firstly,  knowing  the  likelihood  and  the 
potential  severity  of  the  impact  on  the  individual  will  help  the  controller  to  take  effective  steps  to 
contain and address the breach; secondly, it will help it to determine whether notification is required 
to the supervisory authority and, if necessary, to the individuals concerned.  

As explained above, notification of a breach is required unless it is unlikely to result in a risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals, and the key trigger requiring communication of a breach to data 
subjects is where it is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. This risk 
exists  when  the  breach  may  lead  to  physical,  material  or  non-material  damage  for  the  individuals 
whose data have been breached. Examples of such damage are discrimination, identity theft or fraud, 
financial loss and damage to reputation. When the breach involves personal data that reveals racial or 
ethnic  origin,  political  opinion,  religion  or  philosophical  beliefs,  or  trade  union  membership,  or 
includes genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life, or criminal convictions and 
offences or related security measures, such damage should be considered likely to occur39.  

B. 

Factors to consider when assessing risk 

Recitals 75 and 76 of the GDPR suggest that generally when assessing risk, consideration should be 
given  to  both  the  likelihood  and  severity  of  the  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects.  It 
further states that risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment. 

It should be noted that assessing the risk to people’s rights and freedoms as a result of a breach has a 
different  focus  to  the  risk  considered  in  a  DPIA)40.  The  DPIA  considers  both  the  risks  of  the  data 
processing  being  carried  out  as  planned,  and  the  risks  in  case  of  a  breach.  When  considering  a 
potential breach, it looks in general terms at the likelihood of  this occurring, and the damage to the 
data  subject  that  might  ensue;  in  other  words,  it  is  an  assessment  of  a  hypothetical  event.  With  an 
actual breach, the event has already occurred, and so the focus is wholly about the resulting risk of the 
impact of the breach on individuals. 

Example 
 
A  DPIA  suggests  that  the proposed use  of  a  particular  security  software  product  to  protect  personal 
data is  a  suitable  measure  to  ensure  a  level  of  security  appropriate to  the  risk  the  processing  would 
otherwise present to individuals. However, if a vulnerability becomes subsequently known, this would 
change the software’s suitability to contain the risk to the personal data protected and so it would need 
to be re-assessed as part of an ongoing DPIA. 
 

                                                             
39 See Recital 75 and Recital 85. 

40 See WP Guidelines on DPIAs here: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44137    

 

23 

 

A vulnerability in the product is later exploited and a breach occurs. The controller should assess the 
specific  circumstances  of  the  breach,  the  data  affected,  and  the  potential  level  of  impact  on 
individuals, as well as how likely this risk will materialise.  

 

Accordingly,  when  assessing  the  risk  to  individuals  as  a  result  of  a  breach,  the  controller  should 
consider the specific circumstances of the breach, including the severity of the potential impact and 
the likelihood of this occurring. WP29 therefore recommends the assessment should take into account 
the following criteria41: 

  The type of breach 

The  type  of  breach  that  has  occurred  may  affect  the  level  of  risk  presented  to  individuals.  For 
example,  a  confidentiality  breach  whereby  medical  information  has  been  disclosed  to  unauthorised 
parties may have a different set of consequences for an individual to a breach where an individual’s 
medical details have been lost, and are no longer available.  

  The nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data 

Of course, when assessing risk, a key factor is the type and sensitivity of personal data that has been 
compromised by the breach.  Usually, the more sensitive the data, the higher the risk of harm will be 
to the people affected, but consideration should also be given to other personal data that may already 
be  available  about  the  data  subject.  For  example,  the  disclosure  of  the  name  and  address  of  an 
individual  in  ordinary  circumstances  is  unlikely  to  cause  substantial  damage.  However,  if  the  name 
and address of an adoptive parent is disclosed to a birth parent, the consequences could be very severe 
for both the adoptive parent and child. 

Breaches involving health data, identity documents, or financial data such as  credit card details, can 
all cause harm on their own, but if used together they could be used for identity theft. A combination 
of personal data is typically more sensitive than a single piece of personal data. 

Some  types  of  personal  data  may  seem  at  first  relatively  innocuous,  however,  what  that  data  may 
reveal  about  the  affected  individual  should  be  carefully  considered.  A  list  of  customers  accepting 
regular  deliveries  may  not  be  particularly  sensitive,  but  the  same  data  about  customers  who  have 
requested that their deliveries be stopped while on holiday would be useful information to criminals. 

Similarly, a small amount of highly sensitive personal data can have a high impact on an individual, 
and  a  large  range  of  details  can  reveal  a  greater  range  of  information  about  that  individual.  Also,  a 
breach  affecting  large  volumes  of  personal  data  about  many  data  subjects  can  have  an  effect  on  a 
corresponding large number of individuals. 

  Ease of identification of individuals 

An  important  factor  to  consider  is  how  easy  it  will  be  for  a  party  who  has  access  to  compromised 
personal  data  to  identify  specific  individuals,  or  match  the  data  with  other  information  to  identify 
individuals.  Depending  on  the  circumstances,  identification  could  be  possible  directly  from  the 
personal data breached with no special research needed to discover the individual’s identity, or it may 
be extremely difficult to match  personal data  to a particular  individual, but it could  still be possible 

                                                             
41 Article 3.2 of Regulation 611/2013 provides guidance the factors that should be taken into consideration in 
relation to the notification of breaches in the electronic communication services sector, which may be useful in 
the context of notification under the GDPR. See http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:0002:0008:en:PDF  

24 

 

 

under certain conditions. Identification may be directly or indirectly possible from the breached data, 
but it may also depend on the specific context of the breach, and public availability of related personal 
details. This may be more relevant for confidentiality and availability breaches.  

As stated above, personal data protected by an appropriate level of encryption will be unintelligible to 
unauthorised  persons  without 
the  decryption  key.  Additionally,  appropriately-implemented 
pseudonymisation (defined in  Article 4(5) as “the processing of personal data in such a manner that 
the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information,  provided  that  such  additional  information  is  kept  separately  and  is  subject  to  technical 
and  organisational  measures  to  ensure  that  the  personal  data  are  not  attributed  to  an  identified  or 
identifiable natural person”) can also reduce the likelihood of individuals being identified in the event 
of  a  breach.  However,  pseudonymisation  techniques  alone  cannot  be  regarded  as  making  the  data 
unintelligible. 

  Severity of consequences for individuals. 

Depending on the nature of the personal data involved in a breach, for example, special categories of 
data, the potential damage to individuals that could result can be especially severe, in particular where 
the breach could result in identity theft or fraud, physical harm, psychological distress, humiliation or 
damage to reputation. If the breach concerns personal data about vulnerable individuals, they could be 
placed at greater risk of harm.  

Whether  the  controller  is  aware  that  personal  data  is  in  the  hands  of  people  whose  intentions  are 
unknown  or  possibly  malicious  can  have  a  bearing  on  the  level  of  potential  risk.  There  may  be  a 
confidentiality breach, whereby personal data is disclosed to a third party, as defined in Article 4(10), 
or other recipient in error. This may occur, for example, where personal data is sent accidentally to the 
wrong  department  of  an  organisation,  or  to  a  commonly  used  supplier  organisation.  The  controller 
may request the recipient to either return or securely destroy the data it has received. In both cases, 
given  that  the  controller  has  an  ongoing  relationship  with  them,  and  it  may  be  aware  of  their 
procedures,  history  and  other  relevant  details,  the  recipient  may  be  considered  “trusted”.  In  other 
words, the controller may have a level of assurance with the recipient so that it can reasonably expect 
that party not to read or access the data sent in error, and to comply with its instructions to return it. 
Even if the data has been accessed, the controller could still possibly trust the recipient not to take any 
further  action  with  it  and  to  return  the  data  to  the  controller  promptly  and  to  co-operate  with  its 
recovery.  In  such  cases,  this  may  be  factored  into  the  risk  assessment  the  controller  carries  out 
following  the  breach  –  the  fact  that  the  recipient  is  trusted  may  eradicate  the  severity  of  the 
consequences of the breach but does not mean that a breach has not occurred. However, this in turn 
may  remove  the  likelihood  of  risk  to  individuals,  thus  no  longer  requiring  notification  to  the 
supervisory  authority,  or  to  the  affected  individuals.  Again,  this  will  depend  on  case-by-case  basis. 
Nevertheless, the controller still has to keep information concerning the breach as part of the general 
duty to maintain records of breaches (see section V, below).  

Consideration should also be given to the permanence of the consequences for individuals, where the 
impact may be viewed as greater if the effects are long-term. 

  Special characteristics of the individual 

A breach may affect personal data concerning children or other vulnerable individuals, who may be 
placed at greater risk of danger as a result. There may be other factors about the individual that may 
affect the level of impact of the breach on them. 

  Special characteristics of the data controller 

The nature and role of the controller and its activities may affect the level of risk to individuals as a 
result  of  a  breach.  For  example,  a  medical  organisation  will  process  special  categories  of  personal 

25 

 

 

data, meaning that there is a greater threat to individuals if their personal data is breached, compared 
with a mailing list of a newspaper. 

  The number of affected individuals 

A breach may affect only one or a few individuals or several thousand, if not many more. Generally, 
the higher the number of individuals affected, the greater the impact of a breach can have. However, a 
breach can have a severe impact on even one individual, depending on the nature of the personal data 
and the context in which it has been compromised. Again, the key is to consider the likelihood and 
severity of the impact on those affected. 

  General points 

Therefore, when assessing the risk that is likely to result from a breach, the controller should consider 
a combination of the severity of the potential impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals and the 
likelihood of these occurring. Clearly, where the consequences of a breach are more severe, the risk is 
higher and similarly where the likelihood of these occurring is greater, the risk is also heightened. If in 
doubt,  the  controller  should  err  on  the  side  of  caution  and  notify.  Annex  B  provides  some  useful 
examples of different types of breaches involving risk or high risk to individuals. 

The  European  Union  Agency  for  Network  and  Information  Security  (ENISA)  has  produced 
recommendations  for  a  methodology  of  assessing  the  severity  of  a  breach,  which  controllers  and 
processors may find useful when designing their breach management response plan42. 

 

V. 

Accountability and record keeping 

A. 

Documenting breaches 

Regardless of whether or not a breach needs to be notified to the supervisory authority, the controller 
must keep documentation of all breaches, as Article 33(5) explains: 

“The  controller  shall  document  any  personal  data  breaches,  comprising  the  facts  relating  to  the 
personal  data  breach,  its  effects  and the  remedial  action  taken.  That  documentation  shall  enable  the 
supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.” 

This is linked to the accountability principle of the GDPR, contained in Article 5(2). The purpose of 
recording  non-notifiable  breaches,  as  well  notifiable  breaches,  also  relates  to  the  controller’s 
obligations  under  Article  24,  and  the  supervisory  authority  can  request  to  see  these  records. 
Controllers  are  therefore  encouraged  to  establish  an  internal  register  of  breaches,  regardless  of 
whether they are required to notify or not43.  

Whilst it is up to the controller to determine what  method and structure to use when documenting a 
breach, in terms of recordable information there are key elements that should be included in all cases. 
As  is  required  by  Article  33(5),  the  controller  needs  to  record  details  concerning  the  breach,  which 

                                                             
42 ENISA, Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal data breaches,  
https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/dbn-severity  

43 The controller may choose to document breaches as part of if its record of processing activities which is 
maintained pursuant to article 30. A separate register is not required, provided the information relevant to the 
breach is clearly identifiable as such and can be extracted upon request.

should  include its  causes,  what took  place and the personal  data  affected.  It  should also  include the 
effects and consequences of the breach, along with the remedial action taken by the controller. 

The GDPR does not specify a retention period for such documentation. Where such records contain 
personal data, it will be incumbent on the controller to determine the appropriate period of retention in 
accordance  with  the  principles  in  relation  to  the  processing  of  personal  data44  and  to  meet  a  lawful 
basis for processing45. It will need to retain documentation in accordance with Article 33(5) insofar as 
it  may  be  called  to  provide  evidence  of  compliance  with  that  Article,  or  with  the  accountability 
principle  more  generally,  to  the  supervisory  authority.  Clearly,  if  the  records  themselves  contain  no 
personal data then the storage limitation principle46 of the GDPR does not apply. 

In addition to these details, WP29 recommends that the controller also document its reasoning for the 
decisions taken in response to a breach. In particular, if a breach is not notified, a justification for that 
decision should be documented. This should include reasons why the controller considers the breach 
is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals47. Alternatively, if the controller 
considers  that  any  of  the  conditions  in  Article  34(3)  are  met,  then  it  should  be  able  to  provide 
appropriate evidence that this is the case. 

Where the controller does notify a breach to the supervisory authority, but the notification is delayed, 
the controller must be able to provide reasons for that delay; documentation relating to this could help 
to demonstrate that the delay in reporting is justified and not excessive.  

Where the controller communicates a breach to the affected individuals, it should be transparent about 
the  breach  and  communicate  in  an  effective  and  timely  manner.  Accordingly,  it  would  help  the 
controller 
to  demonstrate  accountability  and  compliance  by  retaining  evidence  of  such 
communication. 

To  aid  compliance  with  Articles  33  and  34,  it  would  be  advantageous  to  both  controllers  and 
processors  to  have  a  documented  notification  procedure  in  place,  setting  out  the  process  to  follow 
once a breach has been detected, including how to contain, manage and recover the incident, as well 
as  assessing  risk,  and  notifying  the  breach.  In  this  regard,  to  show  compliance with  GDPR  it  might 
also  be  useful  to  demonstrate  that  employees  have  been  informed  about  the  existence  of  such 
procedures and mechanisms and that they know how to react to breaches.  

It  should  be  noted  that  failure  to  properly  document  a  breach  can  lead  to  the  supervisory  authority 
exercising  its  powers  under  Article  58  and,  or  imposing  an  administrative  fine  in  accordance  with 
Article 83. 

B. 

Role of the Data Protection Officer 

A controller or processor may have a Data Protection Officer (DPO)48, either as required by Article 
37, or voluntarily as a matter of good practice. Article 39 of the GDPR sets a number of mandatory 
tasks for the DPO, but does not prevent further tasks being allocated by the controller, if appropriate.  

                                                             
44 See Article 5 

45 See Article 6 and also Article 9. 

46 See Article 5(1)(e). 

47 See Recital 85 

48 See WP Guidelines on DPOs here: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=50083  

 

27 

 

Of  particular  relevance  to  breach  notification,  the  mandatory  tasks  of  the  DPO  includes,  amongst 
other  duties,  providing  data  protection  advice  and  information  to  the  controller  or  processor, 
monitoring  compliance  with  the  GDPR,  and  providing  advice  in  relation  to  DPIAs.  The  DPO  must 
also cooperate with the supervisory authority and act as a contact point for the supervisory authority 
and  for  data  subjects.  It  should  also  be  noted  that,  when  notifying  the  breach  to  the  supervisory 
authority, Article 33(3)(b) requires the controller to provide the name and contact details of its DPO, 
or other contact point.  

In terms of documenting breaches, the controller or processor may wish to obtain the opinion of its 
DPO as to the structure, the setting up and the administration of this documentation. The DPO could 
also be additionally tasked with maintaining such records. 

These factors mean that the DPO should play an key role in assisting the prevention of or preparation 
for  a  breach  by  providing  advice  and  monitoring  compliance,  as  well  as  during  a  breach  (i.e.  when 
notifying  the  supervisory  authority),  and  during  any  subsequent  investigation  by  the  supervisory 
authority. In this light, WP29 recommends that the DPO is promptly informed about the existence of a 
breach and is involved throughout the breach management and notification process. 

 

VI. 

Notification obligations under other legal instruments 

In addition to, and separate from, the notification and communication of breaches  under the GDPR, 
controllers should also be aware of any requirement to notify security incidents under other associated 
legislation that may apply to them and whether this may also require them to notify the supervisory 
authority  of  a  personal  data  breach  at  the  same  time.  Such  requirements  can  vary  between  Member 
States, but examples of notification requirements in other legal instruments, and how these inter-relate 
with the GDPR, include the following:  

  Regulation  (EU)  910/2014  on  electronic  identification  and  trust  services  for  electronic 

transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation)49. 

Article 19(2) of the eIDAS Regulation requires trust service providers to notify their supervisory body 
of a breach of security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided or 
on the personal data maintained therein. Where applicable—i.e., where such a breach or loss is also a 
personal data breach under the GDPR—the trust service provider should also notify the supervisory 
authority. 

  Directive  (EU)  2016/1148  concerning  measures  for  a  high  common  level  of  security  of 

network and information systems across the Union (NIS Directive)50. 

Articles  14  and  16  of  the  NIS  Directive  require  operators  of  essential  services  and  digital  service 
providers  to  notify  security  incidents  to  their  competent  authority.  As  recognised  by  Recital  63  of 
NIS51,  security  incidents  can  often  include  a  compromise  of  personal  data.  Whilst  NIS  requires 
competent  authorities  and  supervisory  authorities  to  co-operate  and  exchange  information  that 
context, it remains the case that where such incidents are, or become, personal data breaches under the 

                                                             
49 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  

50 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  

51 Recital 63: “Personal data are in many cases compromised as a result of incidents. In this context, 
competent authorities and data protection authorities should cooperate and exchange information on all 
relevant matters to tackle any personal data breaches resulting from incidents.” 

 

28 

 

GDPR,  those  operators  and/or  providers  would  be  required  to  notify  the  supervisory  authority 
separately from the incident notification requirements of NIS.  

Example 

A  cloud  service  provider  notifying  a  breach  under  the  NIS  Directive  may  also  need  to  notify  a 
controller, if this includes a personal data breach. Similarly, a trust service provider notifying under 
eIDAS may also be required to notify the relevant data protection authority in the event of a breach. 

  Directive 2009/136/EC (the Citizens’ Rights Directive) and Regulation 611/2013 (the Breach 

Notification Regulation).  

Providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communication  services  within  the  context  of  Directive 
2002/58/EC52 must notify breaches to the competent national authorities.  

Controllers should also be aware of any additional legal, medical, or professional notification duties 
under other applicable regimes. 

 

                                                             
52 On 10 January 2017, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic 
Communications which will replace Directive 2009/136/EC and remove notification requirements. However, 
until this proposal is approved by the European Parliament the existing notification requirement remains in 
force, see https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-privacy-and-electronic-
communications

Example 

i. A controller stored a 
backup of an archive 
of personal data 
encrypted on a USB 
key. The key is stolen 
during a break-in.   

ii. A controller 
maintains an online 
service. As a result of 
a cyber attack on that 
service, personal data 
of individuals are 
exfiltrated.  

The controller has 
customers in a single 
Member State.  

iii. A brief power 
outage lasting several 
minutes at a

that there was no other 
malware present in the 
system. 

v. An individual 
phones a bank’s call 
centre to report a data 
breach. The individual 
has received a monthly 
statement for someone 
else.  

The controller 
undertakes a short 
investigation (i.e. 
completed within 24 
hours) and establishes 
with a reasonable 
confidence that a 
personal data breach 
has occurred and 
whether it has a 
systemic flaw that may 
mean other individuals 
are or might be 
affected.  

 

vi. A controller 
operates an online 
marketplace and has 
customers in multiple 
Member States. The 
marketplace suffers a 
cyber-attack and 
usernames, passwords 
and purchase history 
are published online 
by the attacker.

if the supervisory 
authority became aware 
of the incident by other 
means, it may consider an 
investigation to assess 
compliance with the 
broader security 
requirements of Article 
32.   

If, after further 
investigation, it is 
identified that more 
individuals are affected, 
an update to the 
supervisory authority 
must be made and the 
controller takes the 
additional step of 
notifying other 
individuals if there is 
high risk to them. 

The controller should 
take action, e.g. by 
forcing password resets 
of the affected accounts, 
as well as other steps to 
mitigate the risk. 

The controller should 
also consider any other 
notification obligations, 
e.g. under the NIS 
Directive as a digital 
service provider.  

The website hosting 
company (processor) 
must consider any other 
notification obligations

Assuming that the 
website hosting 
company has 
conducted its own 
investigation the 
affected controllers 
should be reasonably 
confident as to 
whether each has 
suffered a breach and 
therefore is likely to be 
considered as having 
“become aware” once 
they have been 
notified by the hosting 
company (the 
processor). The 
controller then must 
notify the supervisory 
authority. 

 

viii. Medical records 
in a hospital are 
unavailable for the 
period of 30 hours due 
to a cyber-attack. 

Yes, the hospital is 
obliged to notify as 
high-risk to patient’s 
well-being and privacy 
may occur.

ix. Personal data of a 
large number of 
students are 
mistakenly sent to the 
wrong mailing list 
with 1000+ recipients. 

x. A direct marketing 
e-mail is sent to 
recipients in the “to:” 
or “cc:” fields, thereby 
enabling each recipient 
to see the email 
address of other 
recipients. 

Yes, report to 
supervisory authority. 

Yes, notifying the 
supervisory authority 
may be obligatory if a 
large number of 
individuals are 
affected, if sensitive 
data are revealed (e.g.
