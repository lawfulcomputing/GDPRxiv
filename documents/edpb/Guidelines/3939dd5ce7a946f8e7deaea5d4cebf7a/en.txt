INTRODUCTION 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are currently great scientific research efforts in the fight against 
the SARS-CoV-2 in order to produce research results as fast as possible. 

At the same time, legal questions  concerning the use  of health data pursuant to Article 4 (15) GDPR 
for such research purposes keep arising. The present guidelines aim to shed light on the most urgent 
of  these  questions  such  as  the  legal  basis,  the  implementation  of  adequate  safeguards  for  such 
processing of health data and the exercise of the data subject rights. 

Please note that the development of a further and more detailed guidance for the processing of health 
data for the purpose  of  scientific research is  part of  the annual work plan of  the EDPB. Also, please 
note  that  the  current  guidelines  do  not  revolve  around  the  processing  of  personal  data  for 
epidemiological surveillance. 

2  APPLICATION OF THE GDPR 

Data protection rules (such as the GDPR) do not hinder measures taken in the fight against the COVID -
19 pandemic.1 The GDPR is a broad piece of legislation and provides for several provisions  that allow 
to  handle  the  processing  of  personal  data for  the  purpose  of  scientific  research  connected to  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  in  compliance  with  the  fundamental  rights  to  privacy  and  personal  data 
protection.2 The GDPR also foresees a specific  derogation to the prohibition of  processing of certain 
special categories of personal  data, such as health data, where it is necessary for these purposes of 
scientific research. 3  

5. 

Fundamental  Rights  of  the  EU  must  be  applied  when  processing  health  data for  the  purpose  of 
scientific research connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither the Data Protection Rules nor the 
Freedom  of  Science  pursuant  to  Article  13  of  the  Charter of  Fundamental  Rights of  the  EU  have

precedence  over  the  other.  Rather, these  rights  and  freedoms  must  be  carefully  assessed  and 
balanced, resulting in an outcome which respects the essence of both.  

3  DEFINITIONS 

6. 

7. 

It is important to understand which processing operations benefit from the special regime foreseen in 
the GDPR and elaborated on in the present guidelines. Therefore, the terms “data concerning health”, 
“processing for the purpose of scientific research” as well as “further processing” (also referred to as 
“primary and secondary usage of health data”) must be defined. 

3.1  “Data concerning health” 
According  to  Article  4  (15)  GDPR, “data concerning  health”  means  “personal  data  related to  the 
physical  or mental health of a  natural person, including  the provision  of  health care services, which 
reveal information about his or her health status”. As indicated by Recital 53, data concerning health 
deserves higher protection, as the use of such sensitive data may have significant adverse impacts for 
data subjects.  In  the  light of  this  and  the  relevant jurisprudence  of  the  European  Court  of  Justice 
(“ECJ”),4 the term “data concerning health” must be given a wide interpretation. 

8. 

Data concerning health can be derived from different sources, for example: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Information collected by  a health care provider in  a patient record (such  as medical history 
and results of examinations and treatments). 

Information that becomes health data by cross referencing with other data thus revealing the 
state of  health  or  health  risks  (such  as  the  assumption  that a  person  has  a  higher  risk  of 
suffering  heart attacks based on the high blood  pressure measured over a certain period of 
time). 

Information from a “self check” survey, where data subjects answer questions related to their 
health (such as stating symptoms). 

Information  that  becomes  health  data  because  of  its  usage  in  a  specific  context  (such  as 
information  regarding  a  recent  trip  to  or  presence  in  a  region  affected  with  COVID-19 
processed by a medical professional  to make a diagnosis). 

9. 

 “Processing for the purpose of scientific research” 

3.2 
Article  4  GDPR  does  not  entail  an  explicit  definition  of  “processing  for  the  purpose  of  scientific 
research”. As  indicated by  Recital 159, “the term processing of personal  data for scientific research 
purposes should  be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development 
and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, 
it should take into account the Union’s objective under Article 179 (1) TFEU of  achieving a European 
Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies conducted in the public interest 
in the area of public health.”  

10. 

The  former  Article 29-Working-Party  has  already pointed  out  that the  term may  not  be  stretched 
beyond its common meaning though and understands that “scientific research” in this context means 

                                                             
4 See for example, regarding the Directive 95/46/EC, ECJ 6.11.2003, C-101/01 (Lindqvist) paragraph 50. 

Adopted

“a  research project  set  up  in  accordance with  relevant  sector-related methodological  and  ethical 
standards, in conformity with good practice”.5 

11. 

3.3  “Further processing” 
Finally, when talking about “processing of health data for the purpose of scientific research”, there are 
two types of data usages: 

1.  Research on personal (health) data which consists in the use of data directly collected for the 

purpose of scientific studies (“primary use”). 

2.  Research on  personal  (health) data which  consists  of  the further processing  of data initially 

collected for another purpose (“secondary use”). 

12. 

13. 

14. 

Example 1:  For conducting  a clinical  trial on  individuals  suspected  to be  infected with  SARS-CoV-2, 
health data are collected and questionnaires are used. This is a case of “primary use” of health data as 
defined above. 

Example 2: A data subject has consulted a health care provider as a patient regarding symptoms of the 
SARS-CoV-2. If health data recorded by  the health care provider is being used for scientific  research 
purposes later on, this usage is classified as further processing of health data (secondary use) that has 
been collected for another initial purpose.  

The distinction  between scientific research based  on primary or secondary usage of health data will 
become particularly important when talking about the legal basis for the processing, the information 
obligations and the purpose  limitation principle pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR as outlined below.  

4  LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROCESSING 

15.  All  processing  of  personal  data  concerning  health  must  comply  with  the  principles  relating  to 
processing  set out  in Article 5 GDPR and with one  of the legal grounds  and the specific derogations 
listed respectively in Article 6 and Article 9 GDPR for the lawful processing  of this special category of 
personal data.6  

16. 

Legal bases and applicable derogations for processing health data for the purpose of scientific research 
are provided  for respectively in Article 6 and Article 9. In the following  section, the rules concerning 
consent and respective national legislation are addressed. It has to be noted that there is no ranking 
between the legal bases stipulated in the GDPR. 

17. 

4.1  Consent 
The consent of the data subject, collected pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) and Article 9 (2) (a) GDPR, may 
provide a legal basis for the processing of data concerning health in the COVID-19 context.  

18.  However, it  has to  be noted  that all  the conditions  for  explicit consent, particularly those  found  in 
Article 4 (11), Article 6 (1) (a), Article 7 and Article 9 (2) (a) GDPR, must be fulfilled.  Notably, consent 
must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, and it must be made by way of a statement 
or “clear affirmative action”.

19.  As stated in Recital 43, consent cannot be considered freely given if there is a clear imbalance between 
the data subject and the controller. It is therefore important that a data subject is not pressured and 
does not suffer from disadvantages if they decide not to give consent. The EDPB has already addressed 
consent in the context of clinical trials. 7 Further guidance, particularly on the topic of explicit consent, 
can be found in the consent guidelines of the former Article 29-Working-Party.8  

20. 

21. 

Example:  A  survey  is  conducted  as  part  of  a  non-interventional  study  on  a  given  population, 
researching symptoms  and  the progress  of  a  disease.   For  the  processing  of  such  health data, the 
researchers may seek the consent of the data subject under the conditions  as stipulated in  Article 7 
GDPR. 

In the view of the EDPB, the example above is not considered a case of “clear imbalance of power” as 
mentioned in Recital 43 and the data subject should be able to give the consent to the researchers. 9 In 
the example, the data subjects are not in a situation of whatsoever dependency with the researchers 
that could inappropriately influence the exercise of their free will and it is  also clear that it will have 
no adverse consequences if they refuse to give their consent. 

22.  However, researchers should  be aware that if consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, there 
must  be a possibility  for individuals  to withdraw that consent  at any time pursuant  to Article 7  (3) 
GDPR. If consent  is  withdrawn, all  data processing  operations  that were based  on  consent  remain 
lawful in accordance with the GDPR, but the controller shall stop the processing actions concerned and 
if  there is  no  other  lawful  basis  justifying  the retention  for  further processing,  the  data  should  be 
deleted by the controller.10  

4.2  National legislations 

23.  Article 6 (1)  e or 6 (1)  f GDPR in combination with the enacted derogations under Article 9 (2) (j) or 
Article 9 (2) (i) GDPR can provide a legal basis for the processing of personal (health) data for scientific 
research. In the context of clinical trial this has already been clarified by the Board. 11 

24. 

Example: A large population based study conducted on medical charts of COVID-19 patients.  

25.  As outlined above, the EU as well as the national legislator of each Member State may enact specific 
laws pursuant to Article 9 (2) (j) or Article 9 (2) (i) GDPR to provide  a legal basis for the processing of 
health data for the purpose  of  scientific research. Therefore, the conditions and the extent for such 
processing vary depending on the enacted laws of the particular Member State.  

26.  As stipulated  in Article 9 (2) (i)  GDPR, such laws shall provide  “for suitable and  specific measures to 
safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy”. As similarly 
stipulated  in  Article 9  (2)  (j)  GDPR, such  enacted laws  “shall  be  proportionate to  the aim  pursued, 
respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to 
safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject”.

Furthermore, such enacted laws must be interpreted in the light of the principles pursuant to Article 5 
GDPR and in consideration of the jurisprudence of the ECJ. In particular, derogations and limitations in 
relation to the protection of data provided in Article 9 (2) (j) and Article 89 GDPR must apply only in so 
far as is strictly necessary.12 

5  DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES 

28. 

29. 

30. 

31. 

The principles relating to processing of personal data pursuant to Article 5 GDPR shall be respected by 
the  controller  and  processor,  especially  considering  that a great amount  of  personal  data may  be 
processed for the purpose of scientific research. Considering the context of the present guidelines, the 
most important aspects of these principles are addressed in the following. 

5.1  Transparency and information to data subjects 
The principle of transparency means that personal data shall be processed fairly and in a transparent 
manner  in  relation  to  the  data  subject.  This  principle  is  strongly  connected  with  the  information 
obligations pursuant to Article 13 or Article 14 GDPR.  

In general, a data subject must be individually  informed of the existence of the processing operation 
and that personal (health) data is being processed for scientific purposes. The information delivered 
should  contain all the elements stated in Article 13 or Article 14 GDPR. 

It has to be noted that researchers often process health data that they have not obtained directly from 
the data subject, for instance using data from patient records or data from patients in other countries. 
Therefore, Article 14 GDPR, which covers information obligations where personal data is not collected 
directly from the data subject, will be the focus of this section. 

5.1.1  When must the data subject be informed? 

32.  When personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, Article 14 (3) (a) GDPR stipulates 
that  the  controller  shall  provide  the  information  “within  a  reasonable  period  after  obtaining  the 
personal data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which 
the personal data are processed”.  

33. 

34. 

In the current context, it has to be particularly noted that according to Article 14 (4) GDPR, where “the 
controller intends  to further process the personal  data for  a purpose  other than  that for which  the 
personal  data  were  obtained,  the  controller  shall  provide  the  data  subject  prior  to  that  further 
processing with information on that other purpose”. 

In  the  case  of  the  further  processing  of  data for  scientific  purposes  and  taking  into  account  the 
sensitivity of the data processed, an appropriate safeguard according to Article 89 (1) is to deliver the 
information to the data subject within a reasonable period of time before the implementation of the 
new  research  project. This  allows  the  data subject  to  become  aware of  the  research  project  and 
enables the possibility  to exercise his/her rights beforehand. 

5.1.2  Exemptions 

35.  However, Article (14) (5) GDPR stipulates four exemptions of the information obligation. In the current 
context,  the  exemption  pursuant  to  Article  (14)  (5)  (b)  (“proves  impossible  or  would  involve  a 
disproportionate effort”) and (c) (“obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member

37. 

State law“) GDPR are of  particular relevance, especially  for  the information  obligation  pursuant  to 
Article 14 (4) GDPR. 

5.1.2.1  Proves impossible 
In its  Guidelines  regarding the principle  of Transparency, 13 the former Article 29-Working-Party  has 
already pointed out that “the situation where it “proves impossible” under Article 14 (5) (b) to provide 
the information is an all or nothing situation because something is either impossible or it is not; there 
are  no  degrees  of  impossibility.  Thus,  if  a  data  controller seeks  to  rely on  this  exemption it  must 
demonstrate the factors that actually  prevent it from providing  the information in  question to data 
subjects. If, after a certain period of time, the factors that caused the “impossibility” no  longer exist 
and it becomes possible  to provide the information  to data subjects then the data controller should 
immediately  do  so.  In  practice,  there will  be  very  few  situations  in  which  a  data  controller  can 
demonstrate that it is actually impossible to provide the information to data subjects.” 

5.1.2.2  Disproportionate effort 
In  determining  what  constitutes  disproportionate  effort,  Recital 62  refers  to  the  number  of  data  
subjects,  the  age  of  the  data  and  appropriate  safeguards  in  place  as possible  indicative factors. 
In  the  Transparency  Guidelines  mentioned  above, 14  it  is  recommended  that  the controller  should 
therefore carry out  a balancing exercise to assess  the effort  involved  to provide  the information  to 
data subjects  against the impact and  effects on  the  data subject  if  they  are not provided  with the 
information. 

38. 

Example: A large number of data subjects where there is no available contact information could be 
considered as a disproportionate effort to provide the information. 

39. 

40. 

 Serious impairment of objectives  

5.1.2.3 
To rely on this exception, data controllers must demonstrate that the provision of the information set 
out  in  Article  14  (1)  per  se would  render  impossible  or seriously  impair  the  achievement  of  the 
objectives of the processing.  

In a case where the exemption of Article (14) (5) (b) GDPR applies, “the controller shall take appropriate 
measures to protect the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making 
the information publicly available”. 

5.1.2.4  Obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law 

41.  Article 14 (5) (c) GDPR allows for a derogation of the information requirements in Articles 14 (1), (2) 
and  (4)  insofar  as  the obtaining  or  disclosure  of  personal  data  “is  expressly laid  down by  Union  or 
Member State law to which the controller is subject”. This exemption is conditional upon the law in 
question providing “appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s legitimate interests”. As stated 
in the above mentioned Transparency Guidelines, 15 such law must directly address the data controller 
and  the  obtaining or  disclosure  in  question  should  be  mandatory  upon  the data controller. When 
relying on this exemption, the EDPB recalls that the data controller must be able to demonstrate how

the law in  question applies to them and requires them to either obtain or disclose  the personal data 
in question. 

5.2  Purpose limitation and presumption of compatibility  

42.  As a general rule, data shall be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further 

processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes” pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR. 

43.  However  the  “compatibility  presumption”  provided  by  Article  5  (1)  (b)  GDPR states  that  “further 
processing  for  […]  scientific  research purposes  […]  shall,  in  accordance  with  Article 89  (1),  not  be 
considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes”. This topic, due to its horizontal and complex 
nature, will be considered in  more detail in the planned EDPB guidelines on  the processing of health 
data for the purpose of scientific research. 

44.  Article 89 (1)  GDPR stipulates that the processing of data for research purposes “shall  be subject to 
appropriate safeguards”  and  that those  “safeguards  shall  ensure that technical  and  organisational 
measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. 
Those measures may  include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes  can be fulfilled  in  that 
manner”.  

45. 

46. 

47. 

The requirements of Article 89 (1) GDPR emphasise the importance of the data minimisation principle 
and the principle of  integrity and confidentiality as well as the principle of data protection by  design 
and by  default (see below).16 Consequently,  considering  the sensitive nature of health data and the 
risks when re-using health data for the purpose of scientific research, strong measures must be taken 
in order to ensure an appropriate level of security as required by Article 32 (1) GDPR. 

5.3  Data minimisation and storage limitation 
In scientific research, data minimisation  can be achieved through the requirement of specifying  the 
research questions  and  assessing  the type and amount  of data necessary to properly  answer these 
research questions.  Which  data is  needed depends  on  the purpose  of  the research even  when the 
research has an explorative nature and should  always comply  with the purpose  limitation principle 
pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR. It has to be noted that the data has to be anonymised  where it is 
possible  to perform the scientific research with anonymised  data. 

In addition, proportionate storage periods shall be set. As stipulated by Article 5 (1) (e) GDPR “personal 
data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving 
[…]  scientific  purposes  […]  in  accordance  with  Article  89  (1)  subject  to  implementation  of  the 
appropriate technical and organisational  measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard 
the rights and freedoms of the data subject” 

48. 

In  order  to  define  storage periods  (timelines),  criteria such  as  the length  and  the  purpose  of  the 
research should be taken into account. It has to be noted that national provisions  may stipulate rules 
concerning the storage period as well. 

5.4 

Integrity and confidentiality 

49.  As mentioned above, sensitive  data such as health data merit higher protection as their processing is 
likelier to lead to negative impacts for data subjects. This consideration especially applies in the COVID-

19 outbreak as the foreseeable re-use of health data for scientific purposes leads to an increase in the 
number and type of entities processing such data.  

It has to be noted that the principle of  integrity and confidentiality must be read in conjunction with 
the requirements of Article 32 (1) GDPR and Article 89 (1) GDPR. The cited provisions  must  be fully 
complied  with. Therefore, considering  the  high  risks  as  outlined  above,  appropriate technical  and 
organisational up-to-date measures must be implemented to ensure a sufficient level of security.  

Such measures should  at least consist of pseudonymisation,17  encryption, non-disclosure  agreements 
and strict access role distribution, access role restrictions as well as access logs. It has to be noted that 
national  provisions  may  stipulate  concrete  technical  requirements  or  other  safeguards  such  as 
adherence to professional  secrecy rules. 

Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment  pursuant to Article 35 GDPR must be carried out 
when such processing  is “likely to result in a high risk  to the rights and freedoms of natural persons" 
pursuant to Article 35 (1) GDPR. The lists pursuant to Article 35 (4) and (5) GDPR shall be taken into 
account. 

53.  At this point, the EDPB emphasises the importance of data protection officers. Where applicable, data 
protection  officers  should  be  consulted  on  processing  of  health data  for  the  purpose  of  scientific 
research in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

54. 

Finally,  the  adopted  measures  to  protect  data  (including  during  transfers)  should  be  properly 
documented in the record of processing activities. 

6  EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS 

55. 

56. 

In principle, situations as the current COVID-19 outbreak do not suspend or restrict the possibility of 
data subjects to exercise their rights pursuant to Article 12 to 22 GDPR. However, Article 89 (2) GDPR 
allows the national legislator to restrict (some) of  the data subject’s rights as set in Chapter 3 of the 
regulation. Because of this, the restrictions of the rights of  data subjects may vary depending on the 
enacted laws of the particular Member State.  

Furthermore, some restrictions of the rights of data subjects can be based directly on the Regulation, 
such as the access right restriction pursuant to Article 15 (4) GDPR and the restriction of the right to 
erasure pursuant to Article 17 (3) (d) GDPR. The information obligation exemptions pursuant to Article 
14 (5) GDPR have already been addressed above. 

57. 

It has to be noted that, in the light of the jurisprudence of the ECJ, all restrictions of the rights of data 
subjects must apply only in so far as it is strictly necessary. 18 

                                                             
17 It has to be noted that personal (health data) that has been pseudonymised is still regarded as “personal data“ 
pursuant to Article 4 (1) GDPR and must not be confused with “anonymised data” where it is no longer possible 
for anyone to refer back to individual data subjects. See for example Recital 28. 
18 See for example, regarding the Directive 95/46/EC ECJ 14.2.2019, C–345/17 (Buivids) paragraph 64.

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
PURPOSES 

58.  Within  the context of  research and  specifically in  the context of  the COVID-19 pandemic, there will 
probably be a need for international cooperation that may also imply international transfers of health 
data for the purpose of scientific research outside of the EEA. 

59.  When personal  data is transferred to a non-EEA country or international organisation, in addition to 
complying with the rules set out in GDPR, 19 especially its Articles 5 (data protection principles), Article 
6  (lawfulness)  and Article 9  (special  categories of  data), 20 the data exporter shall  also  comply  with 
Chapter V (data transfers).21 

60. 

61. 

62. 

In addition to the regular transparency requirement as mentioned on page 7 of the present guidelines,  
a duty rests on the data exporter to inform data subjects that it intends to transfer personal data to a 
third country or international organisation. This includes  information about the existence or absence 
of an adequacy decision  by the European Commission,  or whether the transfer is based on a suitable 
safeguard from Article 46 or on a derogation of Article 49 (1). This duty exists  irrespective of whether 
the personal data was obtained directly from the data subject or not. 

In general, when considering how  to address such  conditions  for  transfers of personal  data to third 
countries or international organisations, data exporters should assess  the risks  to the rights and the 
freedoms  of  data subjects  of each transfer22 and  favour  solutions  that guarantee data subjects  the 
continuous  protection of  their fundamental rights and safeguards as regards the processing  of their 
data, even  after it  has  been  transferred. This  will  be  the case  for  transfers  to countries  having  an 
adequate level of protection,23 or in case of use of one of the appropriate safeguards included in Article 
46 GDPR,24 ensuring that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects. 

In the absence  of  an adequacy  decision  pursuant  to Article 45  (3)  GDPR or appropriate safeguards 
pursuant  to  Article  46  GDPR, Article  49  GDPR  envisages  certain  specific  situations  under  which 
transfers of personal data can take place as an exception. The derogations enshrined in Article 49 GDPR 
are thus exemptions from the general rule and, therefore, must be interpreted restrictively, and on a 
case-by-case  basis.25  Applied  to  the  current COVID-19  crisis,  those  addressed  in  Article 49  (1)  (d) 
(“transfer necessary for important reasons of public interest”) and (a) (“explicit consent”) may apply.  

63. 

The COVID-19 pandemic causes an exceptional sanitary crisis  of an unprecedented nature and scale. 
In this context, the EDPB considers that the fight against COVID-19 has been recognised by the EU and

most of its Member States as an important public  interest,26 which may require urgent action in the 
field of scientific research (for example to identify treatments and/or develop vaccines), and may also 
involve transfers to third countries or international organisations. 27 

64.  Not only public authorities, but also private entities playing a role in pursuing such public interest (for 
example, a university’s research institute cooperating on the development of a vaccine in the context 
of an international partnership) could, under the current pandemic context, rely upon  the derogation 
mentioned above.  

65. 

In addition, in certain situations, in particular where transfers are performed by private entities for the 
purpose  of medical research aiming at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic,28 such  transfers of  personal 
data could alternatively take place on the basis of the explicit consent of the data subjects. 29  

66.  Public authorities and private entities may, under the current pandemic context, when it is not possible 
to rely on an adequacy decision  pursuant  to Article 45 (3) or on appropriate safeguards pursuant to 
Article 46, rely upon the applicable derogations mentioned above, mainly as a temporary measure due 
to the urgency of the medical situation globally. 

67. 

68. 

Indeed, if the nature of the COVID-19 crisis may justify the use of the applicable derogations for initial 
transfers carried out for the purpose of  research in this context, repetitive transfers of data to third 
countries  part  of  a  long  lasting  research  project  in  this  regard  would  need  to  be  framed  with 
appropriate safeguards in accordance with Article 46 GDPR. 30 

Finally, it has to be noted that any such transfers will need to take into consideration on a case-by-case 
basis the respective roles (controller, processor, joint controller) and related obligations of the actors 
involved (sponsor, investigator) in order to identify the appropriate measures for framing the transfer. 

8  SUMMARY 

69. 

The key findings of these guidelines are: 

1.  The GDPR provides special rules for the processing of health data for the purpose of scientific 

research that are also applicable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

2.  The national legislator of  each Member State may enact specific laws pursuant to Article (9) 
(2) (i)  and (j)  GDPR to enable the processing of  health data for scientific  research purposes.  
The processing of health data for the purpose of  scientific research must also be covered by 

                                                             
26 Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises a high level of human health 
protection as an important objective that should be ensured in the implementation of all Union policies and 
activities. On this basis, Union action supports national policies to improve public health, including in combatting 
against major health scourges and serious cross-border threats to health, e.g. by promoting res earch into their 
causes, transmission and prevention. Similarly, Recitals 46 and 112 of the GDPR refer to processing carried out 
in the context of the fight against epidemics as an example of processing serving important grounds of public 
interest. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU has adopted a series of measures in a broad range of 
areas (e.g. funding of healthcare systems, support to cross-border patients and deployment of medical staff, 
financial assistance to the most deprived, transport, medical devices etc.) premised on the understanding that 
the EU is facing a major public health emergency requiring an urgent response. 
27 The EDPB underlines that the GDPR, in its Recital 112, refers to the international data exchange between 
services competent for public health purposes as an example of the application of this derogation. 
28 In accordance with Article 49 (3) GDPR, consent cannot be used for activities carried out by public authorities 
in the exercise of their public powers.

one of the legal bases in Article 6 (1) GDPR. Therefore, the conditions and the extent for such 
processing varies depending on the enacted laws of the particular member state.  

3.  All enacted laws based on Article (9) (2) (i) and (j) GDPR must be interpreted in the light of the 
principles  pursuant to Article 5 GDPR and in consideration of the jurisprudence  of the ECJ. In 
particular, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided in Article 
9 (2) (j) and Article 89 (2) GDPR must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. 

4.  Considering the processing risks in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, high emphasise must 
be put on compliance with Article 5 (1) (f), Article 32 (1) and Article 89 (1) GDPR. There must 
be an assessment if a DPIA pursuant to Article 35 GDPR has to be carried out. 

5.  Storage periods  (timelines)  shall be  set and  must be  proportionate. In order  to define  such 
storage periods, criteria such as the length and the purpose  of the research should  be taken 
into account. National provisions may stipulate rules concerning the storage period as well and 
must therefore be considered. 

6. 

In  principle,  situations  as  the  current  COVID-19  outbreak  do  not  suspend  or  restrict  the 
possibility  of data subjects to exercise their rights pursuant to Article 12 to 22 GDPR. However, 
Article 89 (2) GDPR allows the national legislator to restrict (some) of the data subject’s rights 
as set in Chapter 3 of the GDPR. Because of this, the restrictions of the rights of data subjects 
may vary depending on the enacted laws of the particular Member State. 

7.  With respect to international transfers, in  the absence of  an adequacy decision  pursuant to 
Article 45 (3) GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR, public authorities 
and private entities may rely  upon  the applicable derogations pursuant  to Article 49 GDPR. 
However, the derogations of Article 49 GDPR do have exceptional character only.
