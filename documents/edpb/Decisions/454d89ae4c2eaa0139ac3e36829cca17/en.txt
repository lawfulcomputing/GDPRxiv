The European Data Protection Board
Having  regard  to  Article  63  and  Article  65(1)(a)  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the  European
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “GDPR”)1,
Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20182,

Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure3,

Whereas:
(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “EDPB” or the “Board”) is to
ensure the consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it follows from Article
60  GDPR  that  the  lead  supervisory  authority (hereinafter  “LSA”) shall  cooperate  with  the  other
supervisory authorities concerned (hereinafter “CSAs”) in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the
LSA and CSAs shall exchange all relevant information with each other, and that the LSA shall, without
delay,  communicate  the  relevant  information  on  the  matter  to  the  other  supervisory  authorities
concerned. The LSA shall without delay submit a draft decision to the other CSAs for their opinion and
take due account of their views.
(2) Where any of the CSAs expressed a reasoned and relevant objection (“RRO”) on the draft decision
in accordance with Article 4(24) and Article 60(4) GDPR and the LSA does not intend to follow the RRO
or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA shall submit this matter to the
consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR.

(3) Pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall issue a binding decision concerning all the matters
which are the subject of the RROs, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.

(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure,
within one month after the Chair and the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file
is complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of
the subject-matter upon decision of the Chair on its own initiative or at the request of at least one
third of the members of the EDPB.

(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of
the extension by a simple majority of its members.

1 SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE

1.

2.

This document contains a binding decision adopted by the EDPB in accordance with Article 65(1)(a)
GDPR.  The  decision concerns  the  dispute arisen following a draft  decision (hereinafter  “Draft
Decision”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission”, hereinafter the “IE
SA”,  also  referred  to  in  this  context  as  the  “LSA”)  and the  subsequent  objections expressed  by a
number of CSAs (“Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde”, hereinafter the “AT SA”; “Der Hamburgische
Beauftragte  für  Datenschutz  und  Informationsfreiheit”4,  hereinafter  the  ”DE  SA”;  “Datatilsynet”,
hereinafter  the  “DK SA”;  “Agencia  Española  de  Protección  de  Datos", hereinafter  the  “ES  SA”;
“Commission  Nationale  de  l'Informatique  et  des  Libertés", hereinafter  the  “FR  SA”;  “Nemzeti
Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság”, hereinafter the “HU SA”; “Garante per la protezione
dei dati personali", hereinafter the “IT SA”; “Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, hereinafter the “NL SA”).
The draft decision at issue relates to an “own-volition inquiry” which was commenced by the IE SA
following the notification of a personal data breach on 8 January 2019 (the “Breach”) by Twitter
International Company, a company established in Dublin, Ireland (hereinafter “TIC”)5.
The data breach arose from a bug in Twitter's design, due to which, if a user on an Android device
changed  the  email  address  associated  with  their  Twitter  account,  the  protected  tweets  became
unprotected and therefore accessible to a wider public (and not just the user's followers), without the
user's knowledge6. The bug was discovered on 26 December 2018 by the external contractor managing
the company’s “bug bounty programme”, which is a programme whereby anyone may submit a bug
report7.

4.

3. During its investigation, Twitter discovered additional user actions that would also lead to the same
unintentional result. The bug in the code was traced back to a code change made on 4 November
20148.
TIC informed the IE SA that, as far as they can identify, between 5 September 2017 and 11 January
2019, 88,726 EU and EEA users were affected by this bug. Twitter has confirmed that it dates the bug
to 4 November 2014, but it has also confirmed that it can only identify users affected from 5 September
2017 due to a retention policy applicable to the logs9. As a result, TIC acknowledged the possibility that
more users were impacted by the breach10.

5.

The decision of the IE SA to commence the inquiry was taken in circumstances where TIC had, in its
breach  notification  form,  identified  the potential  impact  for  affected  individuals  as  being
“significant”11.

“Berliner  Beauftragte 

Informationsfreiheit  Baden-Württemberg”, 

4 The objection by the Hamburg SA was submitted representing also “Der Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz
und  die 
für  Datenschutz  und
Informationsfreiheit“, “Der  Landesbeauftragte  für  Datenschutz  und 
Informationsfreiheit  Mecklenburg-
Vorpommern”,  “Die Landesbeauftragte  für  den  Datenschutz  Niedersachsen”. The  objection  has  been  also
coordinated with other SAs in Germany.

The IE SA stated in its Draft Decision that it was satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning
of the GDPR, for TIC, as controller in respect of the cross-border processing of personal data carried
out by TIC that was the subject of the breach12.

The following table presents a summary timeline of the events part of the procedure leading to the
submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism:

Twitter, Inc., a company incorporated in the USA receives a bug report through
their bug bounty programme. The report was sent by a third party contractor
managing  the  bug  bounty  programme  (Contractor  1)  to  the third  party
contractor engaged by Twitter, Inc. to search for and assess bugs (Contractor 2).
Contractor 2 shares the result with Twitter, Inc. via a JIRA ticket.
Twitter, Inc.'s Information Security Team reviews the JIRA ticket and decides it
was not a security issue but that it might be a data protection issue.
Twitter, Inc.'s Legal Team is notified.
Twitter, Inc.'s Legal Team decides that the issue should be treated as an incident.
Twitter,  Inc.  triggers  the incident  response  process,  but  due  to a  mistake  in
applying the internal procedure, the Global DPO is not added as ‘watcher’ to the
ticket. Therefore, they are not notified.
The Global DPO is notified of the Data Breach during a meeting.
TIC notifies  the Breach to  the  IE  SA  using  the  IE  SA's cross-border  breach
notification form.
The  scope  and  legal  basis  of  the  inquiry  were  set  out  in  the  notice  of
commencement of inquiry that was sent to TIC on 22 January 2019.
The IE SA commences the inquiry and requests information from TIC.

TIC  makes  further  submissions  to  the  IE  SA  in  response  to  the  IE  SA’s
correspondence of 11 and 28 November 2019.

12 The IE SA has confirmed that its assessment in this regard was based both on its determination that (1) TIC, as
the provider of the Twitter service in the EU/EEA, is the relevant controller and (2) that TIC’s main establishment
in the EU is located in Dublin, Ireland, where decisions on the purposes and means of processing of personal data
of Twitter users in the EU/EEA are taken by TIC, in accordance with Article 4(16) GDPR. Draft Decision, paragraphs

The IE SA issues a Preliminary Draft Decision (hereinafter “the Preliminary Draft
Decision”) to TIC, concluding that TIC infringed Articles 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR;
hence intends to issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 52(2) GDPR and
an administrative fine in accordance with Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) GDPR.
TIC provides submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision to the IE SA.
The IE SA takes account of TIC’s submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft
Decision and prepares its draft decision for submission to the CSAs in accordance
with Article 60 GDPR.
The IE SA shares its Draft Decision with the CSAs in accordance with Article 60(3)
GDPR. Several CSAs (AT SA, DE SA (represented by the DE-Hamburg SA), DK SA,
ES SA, FR SA, HU SA, IT SA and NL SA) raise objections in accordance with Article
60(4) GDPR.
The  IE  SA  issues  a Composite  Memorandum  setting  out  its  replies  to  such
(hereinafter,  “Composite
objections  and 
Memorandum”).  The  IE  SA  requests the  relevant CSAs  to  confirm  whether,
having considered the IE SA’s position in relation to the objections as set out in
the Composite Memorandum, the CSAs intend to maintain their objections.
In  light  of  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  IE  SA  in  the  Composite
Memorandum,  the  DK  SA  informs  the  IE  SA  that  it  does not  maintain  its
objection, and the ES SA informs the IE SA that it withdraws its objection in part.
The other CSAs (i.e., the AT, DE, ES, FR, HU, IT and NL SAs), confirm to the IE SA
that they maintain their remaining objections.
The IE SA refers the matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR,
thereby initiating the dispute resolution procedure under Article 65(1)(a).

The  IE  SA triggered  the  dispute  resolution  process  on  the  IMI  on  19  August  2020. Following  the
submission by the LSA of this matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR, the EDPB
Secretariat assessed the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair in line with Article 11(2) of the
EDPB Rules of Procedure. The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA for the first time on 20 August
2020, asking for additional documents and information to be submitted in IMI and requesting the IE
SA to confirm the completeness of the file. The IE SA provided the documents and information and
confirmed the completeness of the file on 21 August 2020. A matter of particular importance that was
scrutinized by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the
Charter of the Fundamental Rights. On 4 September 2020, the Secretariat contacted the IE SA with
additional questions in order to confirm whether TIC has been given the opportunity to exercise its'
right to be heard regarding all the documents that were submitted to the Board for making its decision.
On 8 September 2020, the IE SA confirmed that it was the case and provided the documents to prove
it13.

9. On 8 September 2020, the decision on the completeness of the file was taken, and it was circulated by

the EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB.

13 Amongst the documents sent by IE SA, there were emails from the Global DPO acknowledging receipt of the
relevant documents.

10. The Chair decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) of the EDPB
Rules of Procedure, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on
account of the complexity of the subject-matter.

2 CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION

11. The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the Board are set forth in Article 60(4)

and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR14.

2.1 Objection(s) expressed by CSA(s) in relation to a draft decision

12. The  EDPB  notes  that CSAs  raised  objections  to  the Draft  Decision via  the  information  and
communication system mentioned in Article 17 of the EDPB Rules of Procedure, namely the Internal
Market Information System. The objections were raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR.

13. More specifically, objections were raised by CSAs in relation to the following matters:

 the competence of the LSA;
 the qualification of the roles of TIC and Twitter, Inc., respectively;
 the infringements of the GDPR identified by the LSA;
 the existence of possible additional (or alternative) infringements of the GDPR;
 the lack of a reprimand;
 the calculation of the proposed fine.

14. Each of these objections was submitted within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR.

2.2 The  LSA  does  not follow  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objections  to  the  draft

decision or is of the opinion that the objections are not relevant or reasoned

15. On 15 July 2020, IE SA provided to the CSAs a detailed analysis of the objections raised by the CSAs in
the Composite Memorandum, where it outlined whether it considered the objections to be “relevant
and reasoned” in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR, and whether it decided to follow any of the
objections15.

16. More  specifically,  the  IE  SA  considered  that only the  objections raised  by  CSAs  in  relation  to  the
calculation of the fine meet the threshold put forward by Article 4(24) GDPR in so far as they relate to
the compliance with the GDPR of the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor and
also  set  out  the risks  posed  as  regards  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects16.
However, the IE SA concluded that it would not follow the objections, for the reasons set out in the
Composite Memorandum and below.

17. The IE SA considered that the other objections expressed by CSAs were not “relevant and reasoned”

within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR.

14 According to Article 65(1)(a) of the GDPR, the Board will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority
has raised a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA or the LSA has rejected such an
objection as being not relevant or reasoned.
15 The purpose of the document, as stated by the IE SA, was to facilitate further cooperation with the CSAs in
relation  to  the  Draft  Decision  and  to  comply  with  the  requirement  in  Article  60(1)  GDPR  that  the  LSA  shall
cooperate with the other CSAs in an endeavour to reach consensus.
16 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 5.59.

Adopted

2.3 Conclusion

18. The case  at  issue  fulfils  all  the  elements  listed  by  Article  65(1)(a)  GDPR,  since several CSAs raised
objections to a draft decision of the LSA within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, and the
LSA has not followed objections or rejected them as not relevant or reasoned.

19. The EDPB is therefore competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which
are  the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection(s),  in  particular  whether  there  is  an
infringement of the GDPR17.

20. All results in this decision are without any prejudice to any assessment or binding decision made in
other cases by the EDPB, including with the same parties, depending on further and/or new findings.

3 THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION

21. The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights, in particular Article 41 (right

to good administration). This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB Rules of Procedure18.

22. The EDPB decision “shall be  reasoned  and  addressed  to  the  lead  supervisory authority  and  all  the
supervisory authorities concerned and binding on them” (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is not aiming to address
directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possibility that TIC might
be affected by the EDPB decision, the EDPB assessed if TIC was offered the opportunity to exercise its
right to be heard in relation to the procedure led by the LSA and in particular if all the documents
received  in  this  procedure  and  used  by  the  EDPB  to  take  its  decision  have already  been  shared
previously to TIC and if TIC has been heard on them.

23. Considering that TIC has been already heard by the IE SA on all the information received by the EDPB
and used to take its decision19 and the LSA has shared to the EDPB the written observations of TIC, in
line with Article 11(2) EDPB Rules of Procedure20, in relation to the issues raised in this specific Draft
Decision, the EDPB is satisfied that the Article 41 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights has been
respected.

4 ON THE QUALIFICATION OF CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR AND THE

COMPETENCE OF THE LSA

4.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

24. The Draft Decision states that “[i]n commencing the Inquiry, the appointed investigator within the [IE
SA] [...] was satisfied that TIC is the controller, within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, in respect
of the personal data that was the subject of the Breach”, and that “[i]n this regard, TIC confirmed that

17 Article 65(1)(a) in fine GDPR. Some CSAs raised comments and not per se objections, which were, therefore,
not taken into account by the EDPB.

it was the controller” in the data breach notification form and in the correspondence with the IE SA21.
The Draft Decision further states that "TIC also confirmed that the Breach had arisen in the context of
processing carried out on its behalf by Twitter Inc., its processor"22 and "TIC is the data controller for
the personal data which is the subject of the Inquiry. TIC has an agreement in place with Twitter Inc.
(its processor) to provide data processing services"23.

25. Additionally, the Draft Decision specifies that the IE SA was further satisfied that it was competent to
act as LSA in respect of cross-border processing carried out by TIC, in relation to the personal data that
was the subject of the Breach24.

26.

In this regard, the Draft Decision further states that TIC confirmed to the IE SA in notifying the Breach
that it was “an Irish company”, and the “provider of the Twitter services in Europe”, and that TIC’s
Privacy Policy (updated on Jan 2016) informed users of the Twitter service in the EU that they had the
right to raise concerns either with their local supervisory authority or with TIC’s LSA, the IE SA25.

27. The IE SA further included in the Draft Decision an excerpt from TIC’s Annual Report and Financial
Statements  relating  to  the  Financial  Year ended  31  December  2018  specifying  that  the  “ultimate
controlling party and the largest group of undertakings for which group financial statements are drawn
up, and of which the company is a member, is Twitter, Inc., a company incorporated in the United States
of America and listed on the New York Stock Exchange”26.

28. The IE SA initially faced uncertainty arising from the use of the terms “we” and “our” in the data breach
notification form to refer interchangeably to TIC and Twitter, Inc. The IE SA sought clarifications in this
regard and TIC indicated that employees of TIC and Twitter, Inc. habitually use “we” and “our” loosely
to refer to the group by its name. In addition, TIC indicated that whilst TIC is the controller and makes
decisions with respect to the purposes and means of data processing, it does not operate alone: “TIC,
and its employees, are part of [...] the Twitter Group [....]. All employees of the Twitter Group use the
same computer systems, they adhere to the same general policies…and work together to ensure the
global round-the-clock support required to keep the Twitter platform operational”27.

4.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

29.

In its objection, the ES SA states that the Draft Decision does not sufficiently justify the role of TIC as
controller. The ES SA stresses that an assessment on which entity really decides on the purposes and
means  should  be  carried  out,  alongside  with  a  critical  analysis  of  all  the  facts  which  took  place.
According to the ES SA, the elements underlying the Draft Decision seem to suggest a conclusion that
is different from the one reached by the IE SA. In particular, the ES SA considers that the decisions on
the essential purposes of the data processing are actually taken by Twitter, Inc. The ES SA supported
its reasoning by listing some factors that, in its view, could suggest that TIC does not decide on the
purposes and means. First, the ES SA recalled that TIC is a subsidiary of Twitter, Inc. and highlighted
that it would therefore be hard to understand how TIC could “issue orders” to Twitter, Inc. relating to
processing of personal data of EEA users. According to the ES SA, TIC was never in the position to
independently choose Twitter, Inc. as its processor and would not be able to replace it. Additionally,

the ES SA argued that Twitter, Inc. does not seem to act as processor due to the “absence of a direct
channel” between the two companies in the management of data breach cases other than the sending
of an email with the Global DPO in copy. Thirdly, the ES SA stated that it was not clear how TIC could
have independently adopted or influenced the decisions leading to the correction of the IT bug in the
system managed and controlled by Twitter, Inc., and that it was rather Twitter, Inc. who undertook
decisions relating to the solution of the Breach, whose effects were not limited only to European users.

30. The NL  SA also raised  an  objection  regarding  the legal  qualification  of TIC  and  Twitter, Inc. as
respectively controller and processor. Specifically, the objection relates to the way the IE SA has argued
that TIC is the sole controller in this case and that Twitter, Inc. is a processor acting on their behalf. The
NL SA considers that assessment of controllership is a fundamental aspect of this case and therefore
any conclusion regarding the role of controller, processor or joint controllers should be supported by
legal and factual evidence. In its objection, the NL SA essentially submits that the Draft Decision does
not contain enough evidence to legally and factually establish the roles of the entities concerned, in
particular to support the conclusion (i) that TIC is the (sole) controller and (ii) that Twitter, Inc. is merely
a processor acting under instruction of TIC for the operation of the global Twitter service and/or the
purposes that are relevant in this case. According to the NL SA, the LSA should verify whether the legal
statements of the organisation and/or their privacy policy corresponds with their actual activities.
The NL SA requested the IE SA to include more information on and/or a description of the factors that
lead to the determination of roles in the Draft Decision document itself. The NL SA also mentions, as
examples of factors to take into account: instructions from TIC to Twitter, Inc., or other objective
evidence or practical clues from daily operations as well as examples from written records such as a
data processing agreement.
In  its  objection,  the DE  SA argues that the  relationship between  Twitter, Inc.  and  TIC  is  not  a
controller-processor  relationship,  but rather  a joint-controllers relationship.  The objection in  first
instance relies on the fact that Twitter, Inc. and TIC do not operate separate data processing systems.
According to the DE SA, the basic system operated by Twitter, Inc. is modified based on decisions made
by TIC and that for EEA users, whereas the main processing system stays the same. The DE SA also
highlighted that all the employees of the group use the same computer system and adhere to the same
general policies.

31.

32. Finally, the FR SA raised an objection regarding the competence of the IE SA, stating that it seemed
that the IE SA came to the conclusion that the decision-making power on the purposes and means of
the processing at stake was exercised by TIC. According to the FR SA, the Draft Decision does not
clearly indicate that other elements than the company TIC’s statements were taken into account by
the authority to consider that this company had a decision-making power on the processing. The FR
SA also specified that the Draft Decision does not clearly indicate if the competence of the authority is
based either on the fact that the company TIC should be considered as the controller, or because TIC
should be regarded as the main establishment as defined by Article 4(16) GDPR. The FR SA concluded
that in its current state the Draft Decision does not prevent the risk of forum shopping, which the one-
stop-shop mechanism is meant to avoid. The FR SA invited the IE SA to provide more elements allowing
to prove that the company TIC has a decision-making power regarding the purposes and means of the
processing for the social network Twitter.

4.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

33.

In its Composite Memorandum, the IE SA considered that an objection based on the role or designation
of the parties as controller and processor and/or on the competence of the IE SA “neither disputes the
finding of an infringement nor the envisaged action and, therefore, does not satisfy the definition at

Adopted

11

Article 4(24)” and that it “does not fall within the meaning of the definition of ‘relevant and reasoned’
objection under Article 4(24)”28. The IE SA nevertheless analysed such objections and, in doing so, set
out  the  factors  which  it  had  considered  in  determining  TIC’s  status  as  controller  and  as  main
establishment. In this regard, the IE SA outlined (by way of summary29) the facts and legal analysis
leading to its conclusion in respect of TIC’s status as controller, in essence:

 Twitter’s previous confirmation in 2015 that it proposed to make TIC in Ireland the controller for

personal data of Twitter users in the EU30;

 TIC’s  confirmation that  it was  controller  for  the  personal  data  affected  by  the  Breach  both  in

notifying the Breach to the IE SA and during the course of the inquiry;

 TIC’s confirmation that a data processing agreement is in place between it and Twitter, Inc. as its

processor, which includes the provisions required by Article 28 GDPR;

 the interactions between TIC and Twitter, Inc. following 7 January 2019, when TIC (through its
DPO)  was  actually  made  aware  of  the  Breach, demonstrating  according  to  the  IE  SA that  TIC
exercised control and decision-making authority over Twitter, Inc. concerning the remediation
activities and notification of the Breach and in relation to the underlying processing of personal
data affected by the Breach; and

 the actions of Twitter, Inc. when it was notified of the incident by Contactor 2, which according to
the IE SA also support the status of the relationship between the two entities as one in which TIC
exercised authority and bore responsibilities as the controller.

34. The IE SA then set out, by way of summary31, the facts and legal analysis leading to its conclusion that

TIC is main established in Ireland, in essence (beyond the points above):

 TIC’s designation and declaration of itself as main establishment;

 TIC’s confirmation in its Privacy Policy of its status as the relevant controller for personal data of

Twitter users in the EU;

 TIC’s place of central administration is in Dublin, where it has approximately 170 employees;

 TIC’s direct employment of a global DPO for the purposes of the GDPR, the reporting line for the
Global DPO within TIC and the Global DPO’s representation of TIC on a range of privacy and data
processing related activities, including the ability to veto data processing;

 the historical and ongoing supervision of TIC by the IE SA, during which it has been apparent that

TIC determines the purposes and means for which personal data are processed within the EU.

The IE SA reiterated that, notwithstanding its response to the substance of the objections raised on
the matters of competence and/or the designation of the parties, it did not consider that the objections
in relation to these issues satisfied the definition of being a “relevant and reasoned objection” under
Article 4(24) GDPR. The IE SA stated that, in light of both its assessment that these matters did not

29 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 5.35.
30 In  this  regard,  the  Composite  Memorandum  explains  that  TIC  informed  the  IE  SA  on  8  April  2015  that  it
proposed to make TIC in Ireland the controller for the personal data of its users outside of the USA and that TIC
notified this fact to other EU supervisory authorities in May 2015 (paragraph 5.15).

satisfy the definition under Article 4(24) GDPR, and in light of its demonstration that it had adequately
addressed  the  questions  of  main  establishment,
its competence,  and  the  controller, processor
designation in its Draft Decision, it did not intend to follow the objections on these matters32.

4.4 Analysis of the EDPB

4.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

35. The EDPB will begin its analysis of the objections raised by assessing whether the aforementioned
objections are to be considered as a “relevant and reasoned objection” within the meaning of Article
4(24) GDPR.

36. Article 4(24) of the GDPR defines “relevant and reasoned objection” as an “objection to a draft decision
as to whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to
the controller or processor complies with this Regulation, which clearly demonstrates the significance
of the risks posed by the draft decision as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects
and, where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union”33.

37. As clarified in the Guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection, an objection needs
to be both “relevant” and “reasoned”. In order for the objection to be “relevant”, there must be a
direct connection between the objection and the draft decision and it needs to concern either whether
there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or
processor complies with the GDPR34.

38. According to the same Guidelines, an objection is “reasoned” when it is coherent, clear, precise and
detailed in providing clarifications and arguments as to why an amendment of the decision is proposed
and  how  the  change would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion35 and when  it  clearly demonstrates the
significance  of  the  risks  posed  by the  draft  decision  for  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  data
subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the European Union. The CSA
should  thus  “show  the  implications  the  draft  decision  would  have  for  the  protected  values”,  by
“advancing  sufficient  arguments  to  show  that  such  risks  are  substantial  and  plausible”36.  The
evaluation of the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of data subjects37 can rely, inter alia, on the
appropriateness,  necessity,  and  proportionality  of  the  measures  envisaged38 and  on  the  possible
reduction of future infringements of the GDPR39.

33 GDPR, Article 4(24).

In terms of content, the objection can, as a first alternative, concern the existence of an infringement
of the GDPR. In this case, it should explain why the CSA disagrees as to whether the activities carried
out by the controller or processor led to the infringement of a given provision of the GDPR, and to
which  infringement(s)  specifically40.  This objection may  also  include  a  disagreement  as  to  the
conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the investigation (e.g. by stating that the findings amount
to an infringement other than / in addition to those already analysed)41 or could go as far as identifying
gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation by the LSA42. However, this is less
likely to happen when the obligation for the LSA to cooperate with the CSAs and exchange all relevant
information has been duly complied with in the time preceding the issuance of the draft decision43.
Alternatively, the content of the objection can refer to the compliance of the action in relation to the
controller or processor (corrective measure or other) envisaged in the draft decision with the GDPR,
by explaining why the action foreseen is not in line with the GDPR44.

40. The EDPB considers it possible for an objection concerning the existence of an infringement of the
GDPR to concern the absence or insufficiency of assessment or reasoning (with the consequence that
the conclusion in the draft decision is not adequately supported by the assessment carried out and the
evidence presented, as required in Article 58 GDPR), as long as the whole threshold set forth by Article
4(24) GDPR is met and provided there is a link between the allegedly insufficient analysis and whether
there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether envisaged action complies with the GDPR45.

41. The EDPB considers that an objection concerning the role, or designation, of the parties can fall within
the meaning of the definition of ‘relevant and reasoned’ objection under Article 4(24) GDPR, as this
can affect the determination as to whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, or whether
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this Regulation. However, the
EDPB considers that an objection on the competence of the supervisory authority acting as LSA should
not be raised through an objection pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR and falls outside of the scope of
Article 4(24) GDPR46.

a) Assessment of the objection raised by the NL SA

42. The objection raised by the NL SA in first instance relates to an “absence or insufficiency of assessment
or reasoning”47 leading to the conclusions drawn by the IE SA as to the legal qualification of TIC and
Twitter, Inc. As the NL SA points out, the assessment of controllership is indeed a fundamental aspect
of the case. A different conclusion as to the legal qualification of TIC and Twitter, Inc. would affect the

40 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 25.
41 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27.
42 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 28 (which also specifies that “In this regard, a distinction must be made between,
on one hand, own-volition inquiries and, on the other hand, investigations triggered by complaints or by reports
on potential infringements shared by concerned supervisory authorities”).
43 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27.
44 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 33. This means that the objection may, inter alia, challenge the elements relied
upon to calculate the amount of the fine (Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 34).
45 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 29.
46 The procedure pursuant to Article 65(1)(b) GDPR is applicable in this case and can be launched at any stage,
Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 31.
47 Guidelines  on  RRO,  paragraph  29.  A  relevant  and  reasoned  objection  concerning  whether  there  is  an
infringement of the GDPR can concern “insufficient factual information or description of the case at stake”, a
“disagreement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the investigation” (Guidelines on RRO,
paragraph 27) or refer to an “absence or insufficiency of assessment or reasoning (with the consequence that the
conclusion in the draft decision is not adequately supported by the assessment carried out and the evidence
presented, as required in Article 58 GDPR)” (Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 29).

conclusions of the supervisory authority, both in relation to the determination of an infringement of
Article 33 GDPR, as well as the decision on the corrective measures resulting from the investigation.

43. The EDPB recalls that each legally binding measure adopted by a supervisory authority must give the
reasons  for  the  measure48. The  determination  as  to  whether  there  is  an  infringement  of  this
Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this
Regulation, hinges on the correct identification of the roles of parties who shall be the subject of the
measure. Therefore, a draft decision must contain sufficient legal and factual elements to support the
proposed decision49. As a result, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the NL SA concerns
both  “whether  there  is  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR”  and  “whether  or  not  the  envisaged  action
complies with the GDPR”.

44. While the EDPB considers that the objection of the NL SA is therefore relevant and includes legal
arguments supporting its position, it does not put forward arguments how such consequences would
pose significant risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects and/or the free flow of data50. The
EDPB recalls that the obligation to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the draft
decision - established by the GDPR - lies with the CSA51. While the possibility for CSAs to provide such
demonstration may also depend on the degree of detail of the draft decision itself and on the previous
exchanges of information52, such a circumstance, where applicable, cannot completely absolve the CSA
from the obligation to clearly set out why it considers that the draft decision, if left unchanged, results
in significant risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals.

45. The EDPB finds that the objection raised by the NL SA does not clearly demonstrate the risks for the
rights and freedoms of individuals as such. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised
by the NL SA does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

b) Assessment of the objection raised by the ES SA

46. The objection raised by the ES SA also challenges the sufficiency of the assessment or reasoning in
relation to the conclusions drawn by the IE SA as to the legal qualification of TIC and Twitter, Inc.
respectively. The objection also makes clear that the correct qualification of the TIC and Twitter, Inc.
is key for determining their respective responsibilities, as well as for the competence of the IE SA. As a
result, the EDPB also considers that the objection raised by the ES SA concerns both “whether there is
an infringement of the GDPR” and “whether or not the envisaged action complies with the GDPR”. The
objection of the ES SA also sets out why it considers that a change to the Draft Decision is necessary
and how the change would lead to a different conclusion.

47. While the EDPB considers that the objection of the ES SA is therefore relevant and includes legal
arguments supporting its position, it does not clearly articulate why the decision, if left unchanged in
this  respect,  would  pose  significant  risks  for the  rights  and  freedoms of  data  subjects and,  where
applicable, the free flow of personal data. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised
by the ES SA does not meet the requirements set out in Article 4(24) GDPR.

c) Assessment of the objection raised by the DE SA

48. While the objections expressed by the NL and ES SA primarily relate to an “absence of reasoning”
justifying the conclusion that TIC acts as (sole) controller, the DE SA disagrees as to the conclusions to
be drawn from the findings of the investigation53. In particular, the DE SA considers that the factual
elements included in the file are sufficient to justify the conclusion that Twitter, Inc. does not qualify
as a processor, but rather as a joint controller, together with TIC.

49.

In  its  objection,  the  DE  SA  also  sets  out  why  the  qualification  of  the  parties  is  relevant  to  the
determination of “whether there is in infringement”. In particular, the DE SA argues that the legal
assessment of the relationship between Twitter, Inc. and TIC affects the determination of the moment
of becoming aware of the Breach. According to the DE SA, knowledge must be equally attributed to
both (joint) controllers in light of Article 26(1) GDPR. Taking this into account, the DE SA argues that
the relevant date when TIC as joint controller obtained knowledge (or rather should have obtained
knowledge) needs to be reconsidered by the IE SA.

50. The EDPB considers that the objection raised by the DE SE clearly sets out why changing the Draft
Decision is  considered  necessary  and  how  the  objection,  if  followed, would  lead  to  a  different
conclusion. That being said, the EDPB does not find that the objection raised by the DE SA includes a
clear statement regarding the risks posed by the Draft Decision as regards the fundamental rights and
freedoms of data subjects in relation to the qualification of the parties as such. On this basis, the EDPB
considers that the objection raised by the DE SA does not meet the requirements set out in Article
4(24) GDPR.

d) Assessment of the objection raised by the FR SA

51. The FR SA in essence also considers that the Draft Decision suffers from “an absence or insufficiency
of assessment or reasoning”, in that it does not clearly indicate that other elements than TIC’s own
statements were taken into account by the IE SA to consider that TIC exercised decision-making power
over the processing. Similar to the NL SA and ES SA, the FR SA also stresses the importance that the
decision of the LSA is sufficiently reasoned. Different from the NL SA and ES SA, however, the FR SA
focuses in its objection primarily on the importance of including such reasoning in establishing the
competence of an authority of the LSA, in particular with a view of preventing forum shopping.

52. The EDPB recalls that a disagreement on the competence of the supervisory authority acting as LSA to
issue a decision in the specific case should not be raised through an objection pursuant to Article 60(4)
GDPR and falls outside of the scope of Article 4(24) GDPR54. The EDPB considers that the objection
raised by the FR SA does not advance sufficient arguments to clearly demonstrate the significance of
the risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects posed by the Draft Decision. As a result, the EDPB
considers that the objection raised by the FR SA does not amount to a relevant and reasoned objection
within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR.

4.4.2 Conclusion

53. The EDPB considers that the aforementioned objections satisfy several of the criteria of Article 4(24)
GDPR. Differently to  the  conclusion  made  by  the IE  SA,  the  EDPB  considers  that  each  of those
objections satisfied the condition of referring alternatively to whether there is an infringement of this
Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this

53 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27.
54 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 31. The Guidelines go on to state that unlike the objection pursuant to Article
60(4) GDPR, the procedure pursuant to Article 65(1)(b) GDPR is applicable at any stage.

Adopted

16

Regulation. In addition, the EDPB considers that an objection based on the role, or designation, of the
parties can in principle fall within the meaning of the definition of ‘relevant and reasoned’ objection
under Article 4(24) GDPR.

54. However, as stated above, the aforementioned objections do not meet the threshold of providing a
clear demonstration as to the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision as regards the
fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal
data within the European Union.

55.

In addition, as regards the aforementioned objection raised by the FR SA, in addition to not advancing
sufficient arguments to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risk for the rights and freedoms of
data subjects posed by the Draft Decision, the objection concerns a disagreement on the competence
of the supervisory authority acting as LSA. The EDPB recalls that such disagreement should not be
raised through an objection pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR and falls outside of the scope of Article
4(24) GDPR55.

56. As a result, the EDPB considers that the aforementioned objections do not meet the requirements set

out in Article 4(24) GDPR.

57. As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised
by these objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any
assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties,
taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

5 ON THE INFRINGEMENTS OF THE GDPR FOUND BY THE LSA

5.1 On the findings of an infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR

5.1.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

58. The IE SA concluded that TIC did not meet its obligations as a controller under Article 33(1) GDPR,
which  "cannot  be  viewed  in  isolation  and  must  be  understood  within  the  context  of  the  broader
obligations on controllers under the GDPR, in particular, the obligation of accountability under Article
5(2), the relationship between controllers and processors (Article 28), and the obligation to implement
appropriate (and effective) technical and organisational measures"56.

59. With regard to the moment at which the controller became aware of the Breach, the Draft Decision
concluded that in case the Breach is suffered by the processor, the controller becomes aware when it
is  notified  of  the Breach by  the  processor57,  but  the  controller  must  ensure  that  it  has  sufficient
measures  in  place  to  facilitate  this  awareness58.  Because  TIC  as  controller  was  responsible  for

56 Draft  Decision,  paragraph  6.20.  See  also  Draft  Decision,  paragraphs  6.5,  6.7,  and  6.13. The  Draft  Decision
(paragraph 7.129 (i)) also states that the “requirement under Article 33(1) [...] is predicated upon the controller
ensuring that it has internal systems and procedures (and where applicable, systems and procedures in place with
any external parties including processors) that are configured, and followed, so as to facilitate prompt awareness,
and timely notification, of breaches”.
57 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (iii).
58 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.98.

Adopted

17

overseeing the processing operations carried out by its processor Twitter, Inc.59, the Draft Decision
stated that where the processor does not follow the procedure or the procedure fails otherwise the
controller cannot excuse its own delayed notification on the basis of the processor’s fault60, as the
performance by a controller of its obligation to notify cannot be contingent upon the compliance by
its  processor  with  its  obligations  under  Article  33(2) GDPR61.  The  IE  SA  found  that  in  these
circumstances the controller must be considered as having constructive awareness of the personal
Breach through  its  processor62,  and  that  such  an  interpretation  reflects  the  responsibility  and
accountability of the controller in the GDPR63.

60. According to the Draft Decision, therefore, TIC became actually aware of the Breach on 7 January
201964 but should have been aware of the Breach at the latest by 3 January 2019, since on that date
Twitter, Inc. as processor first assessed the incident as being a potential data breach and the Twitter,
Inc. legal team instructed that the incident be opened65. The Draft Decision also stated that even in the
particular circumstances of this situation (where earlier delays had also arisen66, any arrangements in
place with Twitter, Inc. should have enabled this67. Instead, due to the “ineffectiveness of the process”
in the “particular circumstances” of the case at stake and/or “a failure by [the processor’s] staff to
follow its incident management process” there was a delay leading to the controller being notified only
on 7 January 201968. This led to the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR even if less than 72 hours
elapsed between the moment at which TIC became actually aware of the Breach (7 January 2019) and
the notification (8 January 2019).

5.1.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

61. The FR SA raised an objection stating that the findings do not correspond to an infringement of Article
33(1) GDPR, but rather of Article 28 or Article 32 GDPR, which set out the obligations of the controller
when it decides to have recourse to a processor. This argument relies on the fact that the finding of
the infringement of Article 33(1) is mainly based on the failures in the application of the procedure

59 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (iv).
60 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (iv).
61 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (x).
62 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (v).
63 Draft  Decision,  paragraph  7.98.  According  to  the  Draft  Decision,  an  alternative  interpretation  leading  to
consider that a controller is  only “aware” when informed by its processor, leaves a significant lacuna in the
protection provided by the GDPR, as it could result in the controller avoiding responsibilities even in case of major
delays if it showed it satisfied its obligations in choosing a processor and having proper systems in place, but such
systems were disregarded by the processor (Draft Decision, paragraph 7.99). The IE SA further outlined in the
Draft Decision that “the alternative application of Article 33(1), and that which was suggested by TIC, whereby
the performance by a controller of its obligation to notify is, essentially, contingent upon the compliance by its
processor with its obligations under Article 33(2), would undermine the effectiveness of the Article 33 obligations
on a controller [and that] [s]uch an approach would be at odds with the overall purpose of the GDPR and the
intention of the EU legislator”.
64 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (vi).
65 Draft Decision, paragraph 7.129 (vi).
66 In identifying the 3 January 2019 as the date on which TIC ought to have been aware of the breach, the IE SA
also took into account that an earlier delay had arisen during the period from when the incident was first notified
by the External Contractor (Contractor 2) to Twitter, Inc. on 29 December 2018 to when Twitter, Inc. commenced
its review of same, on 2 January 2019. TIC confirmed, during the course of the inquiry, that this was “due to the
winter holiday schedule”.

established between TIC and its processor in case of a data breach, whereas Article 33(1) GDPR refers
only to the obligation of the controller to notify data breaches to the competent authority.

62. The objections of the DE SA, instead, focused on the reasoning leading to the conclusion that Article
33(1) GDPR was infringed, without challenging such conclusion per se, and referred more specifically
to the determination of the dies a quo of the 72-hour deadline.

63. The DE SA argued in its objection that the issue of the allocation of roles affects the determination of
the moment of awareness of the Breach, as the knowledge of a breach must be equally attributed to
both joint controllers. According to the DE SA, this may lead to considering 26 December 2018 as the
date when TIC as joint controller got knowledge/should have got knowledge of the Breach.

5.1.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

64. With regard to the objection raised by the FR SA, the IE SA considers that it requests consideration of
alternative provisions of the GDPR and that the request by CSAs to consider alternate provisions of the
GDPR, would essentially seek to re-scope the Inquiry conducted69: the IE SA concluded that such an
objection does not fall within the definition of “relevant and reasoned objection” for the purposes of
Article 4(24) GDPR70. The IE SA also stressed its view that an infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR has
occurred and did not propose to consider infringements of any other provisions of the GDPR as an
alternative to Article 33(1)71, underlining that expanding the range of the infringements to other GDPR
obligations at the request of CSAs would “jeopardise the entirety of the Inquiry and Article 60 process
by exposing it to the risk of claims of procedural unfairness”72. The IE SA also pointed out that it is
examining TIC’s compliance with its broader obligations under the GDPR in the context of another
ongoing inquiry73.

65. Concerning the objection raised by the DE SA, with specific regard to the determination of the moment
of awareness of the breach, the IE SA submitted that even if a relationship of joint controllership did
exist (a view that, as outlined above in Section 4.3, the IE SA did not share) it would not necessarily
mean that awareness of the Breach could be equally attributed to both joint controllers74.

5.1.4 Analysis of the EDPB

5.1.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

66. As recalled above (see Section 4.4.1), it is necessary to assess whether the objections raised by the

CSAs meet the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR.

67. Although  the  objection of  the FR  SA is  relevant,  since  it  outlines  a  disagreement  on  whether  an
particular infringement of the GDPR has taken place in the specific case, and it includes legal arguments
supporting the objection, it fails to meet the Article 4(24) GDPR standard because it does not include
justifications concerning the consequences of issuing a decision without the changes proposed in the
objection, and how such consequences would pose significant risks to the rights and freedoms of data

subjects75. Thus, the objection cannot be said to “clearly demonstrate” the significance of the risks
posed by the issuance of the Draft Decision (if it were to be issued as final) since it does not provide
sufficient arguments as to why such rights and freedoms of data subjects with specific regard to the
finding  of  an  infringement  of  Article  33(1)  (instead  of  Article  32  /  28)  GDPR  are  substantial  and
plausible76. Therefore, the EDPB concludes the objection of the FR SA is not relevant and reasoned due
to the lack of a clear demonstration of the risks as specifically required by the Article 4(24) GDPR.

68. Additionally, with regard to the DE SA’s objection specifically in relation to the determination of the
dies a quo for the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR as depending on the qualification of the parties,
the EDPB would like to recall the analysis performed above in Section 4.4 and finds that the objection
does not show the implications the Draft Decision with its current content - specifically concerning the
reasoning underlying the finding of a Breach of Article 33(1) GDPR - would have for the protected
values77 (rights and freedoms of data subjects or, where applicable, free flow of personal data).

5.1.4.2

Conclusion

69. The EDPB  considers  that  the  aforementioned  objections  satisfied  the condition  of  referring
alternatively as to whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, or whether envisaged action in
relation  to  the  controller  or  processor  complies  with  this  Regulation,  but  they  do  not  clearly
demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision as regards the fundamental rights
and  freedoms  of  data  subjects  and,  where  applicable,  the  free  flow  of  personal  data  within  the
European Union.

70. Therefore, the FR and DE SA’s objections do not to meet the requirements in Article 4(24) GDPR78.

5.2 On the findings of an infringement of Article 33(5) GDPR

5.2.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

71.

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA found that TIC did not comply with its obligations under Article 33(5)
GDPR to document the Breach, since the documentation furnished by TIC in the course of the inquiry
was not considered to contain sufficient information and was not considered to contain a record or
document of, specifically, a “personal data breach”, as they amounted to “documentation of a more
generalised nature”79.

72. On a different note, the IE SA acknowledged that TIC fully cooperated during the inquiry (although this

was not considered as a mitigating factor)80.

5.2.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

73. The EDPB takes the opportunity to highlight, for the sake of clarity, that none of the objections raised

challenged the conclusion that TIC infringed Article 33(5) GDPR.

75 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 19.
76 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 37.
77 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 37.
78 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of
the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

74. However, the IT SA raised an objection arguing that the finding related to the violation of Article 33(5)
GDPR does not appear consistent with the reasoning and elaborations put forward by the LSA as the
inadequacy of the documentation that was produced during such an extensive investigation, as based
upon multiple interactions between the LSA and the controller, allegedly points to the controller’s poor
cooperation with the DPA. According to the IT SA, the finding in the Draft Decision that TIC provided
full cooperation during the investigative phase should be reviewed as such full cooperation can only
be considered to exist if adequate, exhaustive documentation is made available by the controller in a
straightforward manner.

5.2.3

Position of the LSA on the objections

75. The IE SA is of the opinion that the obligation under Article 33(5) GDPR applies independently of the
obligation under Article 31 GDPR to co-operate with the supervisory authority and of how TIC behaved
towards,  and  interacted with,  the  LSA  at  the  time  that  the  latter  initiated  its  regulatory  activities
regarding TIC’s Breach81. The IE SA argued the deficiencies on how TIC documented the Breach do not
necessarily correlate with a lack of cooperation on TIC’s part82. In addition, the IE SA highlighted that
TIC cooperated with the IE SA during the inquiry by responding to all requests for information and by
providing all the requested documents, without seeking to disrupt or obstruct the inquiry in any way83.
In  any  case,  the IE  SA did  not  consider TIC’s  cooperation  as  a  mitigating  factor84. For  the  above-
mentioned reasons, the IE SA considered that it was “questionable” as to whether the objection raised
by the IT SA is reasoned and relevant, since while it relates to an infringement of the GDPR it does not
demonstrate how the IE SA’s position on TIC’s degree of cooperation results in risks posed by the draft
decision regarding fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects85. The IE SA concluded it would
not follow said objection86.

5.2.4 Analysis of the EDPB

5.2.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

76. The IT SA in its objection does not dispute that an infringement of Article 33(5) GDPR has occurred. A
relevant and reasoned objection may question the reasoning underlying the conclusions reached by
the  LSA  in  the  draft  decision  only  insofar  as  such  reasoning  has  a  link  with  such  conclusions,  the
objection is adequately reasoned. In this case, the objection does not clearly argue how following it
could entail a change in the Draft Decision. Additionally, the objection does not meet the criteria
outlined in Article 4(24) GDPR because it fails to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks posed
by the Draft Decision as it does not show the implications the alleged mistake in the Draft Decision
would have for the protected values.

5.2.4.2

Conclusion

77. As the IT SA’s objection does not meet the requirements of the Article 4(24) GDPR, the Board does not
take a position on the merit of the substantial issues raised by this objection. The EDPB reiterates that
its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make

6 ON  POTENTIAL  FURTHER (OR  ALTERNATIVE) INFRINGEMENTS  OF

THE GDPR IDENTIFIED BY THE CSAS

6.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

78. Based on the information provided by TIC when it notified the Breach to the IE SA, the IE SA noticed
that it appeared from the breach notification form that a period of in excess of 72 hours had elapsed
from when TIC (as controller) became aware of the Breach87. For this reason, the IE SA decided to
commence, on its own volition, an inquiry to examine whether TIC had complied with its obligations
under Article 33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR88.

79.

In order to determine whether TIC complies with its obligations under Article 33(1) GDPR, the IE SA
considered them in the context of a controller's broader obligations, including those of accountability
(Article 5(2) GDPR), of engagement of a processor (Article 28 GDPR), and in respect of the security of
processing of personal data (Article 32 GDPR)89. However, if the IE SA considered the factors and factual
matters that led to TIC's delay in being made aware of the Breach by its processor and ultimately in
notifying the Breach, the IE SA did not consider whether or not TIC complied with any or each of these
obligations other than for the purpose of assessing TIC’s compliance with its obligations under Article
33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR90.

6.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

80. The DE, FR, HU, and IT SAs raised objections that TIC infringed other provisions of the GDPR in addition

to, or instead of, Article 33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR.

6.2.1 Infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR on the principle of integrity and

confidentiality

81. The DE SA raised an objection stating that the "underlying bug" in TIC's application that resulted in the
Breach notified to the IE SA should have been considered by the IE SA in its Draft Decision, so as to
determine  whether  this  bug  actually  constituted  a  significant  violation  of  the  confidentiality  of
personal data, ultimately infringing Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, in addition to Article 33(1) and Article 33(5)
GDPR.

82. The HU SA raised an objection stating that given the “bug” in TIC’s application over the years and its
serious nature affecting data security, the IE SA should investigate whether TIC also infringed Article
5(1)(f) GDPR on the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

6.2.2 Infringement of Article 5(2) GDPR on the principle of accountability

83. The IT SA raised an objection stating that the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR highlights a much
more  severe  violation  of  the  accountability  principle  (under  Article  5(2) GDPR),  since  the  lack  of

Adopted

22

corporate policies to handle security incidents or the failure to comply with them shows that the
measures implemented by the controller are inadequate to ensure compliance and to document it.
The IT SA argued that these procedural shortcomings are highlighted by the Draft Decision, but the
Draft Decision fails to make this the subject of a specific analysis. As this may affect the handling of
future data breaches, too, the findings on whether TIC complied with Article 5(2) GDPR should also be
part of the IE SA's final decision according to the IT SA. The IT SA also considered that the infringement
of Article 5(2) GDPR is confirmed by the controller's inability to state the exact number and nature of
the personal data affected, or the total number of data subjects involved.

6.2.3 Infringement of Article 24 GDPR on the responsibility of the controller

84. The DE SA raised an objection stating that the Draft Decision is not clear on why the IE SA did not assess
if the significant violation of the confidentiality of personal data caused by an "underlying bug" is due
to an infringement of the requirements of Article 24 GDPR.

6.2.4 Infringement of Article 28 GDPR on the relationship with processors

85. The FR SA expressed an objection stating that TIC did not respect the obligation of the controller to
verify the validity of the procedures set up by its processor. Therefore, the FR SA considers that there
is no infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR, but of Article 28 GDPR instead (or Article 32 GDPR - see below
Section 6.2.5). The FR SA argued that if TIC's processor is its parent company, “it was all the more easy
for  TIC  to  verify  the  validity  of  the procedures  set  out  by  the  parent  company  and  to  demand  a
correction if necessary”.

86. The IT SA expressed an objection stating that TIC’s failure to involve the Global DPO in the Detection
and Response Team of the processor (Twitter, Inc.), in spite of the fact that this practice was envisaged
in TIC's internal policies, shows that the safeguards provided by the processor in terms of implementing
the  appropriate  organisational  measures  under  Article  28(1) GDPR  are  not  extensive  enough.  In
addition, the IT SA argued in its objections that the processor infringed its obligation to assist the
controller, according to Article 28(3)(f) GDPR.

6.2.5 Infringement of Article 32 GDPR on the security of the processing

87. The DE SA raised objections stating that the IE SA should have examined if all appropriate technical
and  organisational measures  (according  to  Article 32  GDPR)  were  complied  with  in  this  case,  and
whether infringements in this area should have been made the subject of these proceedings. The DE
SA also argues that the Draft Decision is not clear on why the IE SA did not assess if the significant
violation  of  the  confidentiality  of  personal  data  caused  by  an  "underlying  bug"  is  due  to  an
infringement of the requirements of Article 32 GDPR.

88. The FR SA expressed an objection concerning the legal characterisation of the facts carried out by the
IE SA and stated that the TIC’s failure to respect the obligation of the controller to verify the validity of
the procedures set up by its processor corresponds to an infringement of Article 32 GDPR (or Article
28 GDPR - see above Section 6.2.4), rather than of Article 33(1) GDPR. The FR SA argued that if TIC's
processor is its parent company, “it was all the more easy for TIC to verify the validity of the procedures
set out by its parent company and to demand a correction if necessary”.

89. The HU SA raised objections stating that given the “bug” in TIC’s application over the years and its
serious nature affecting data security, the IE SA should investigate whether TIC infringed also Article
32 GDPR on TIC’s obligations of security of the processing.

Adopted

23

6.2.6 Infringement of Article 33(3) GDPR on the content of the notification of a

personal data breach on security of processing

90. The DE SA expressed objections stating that the IE SA’s examination is lacking, with regard to the scope
of the information to be provided in the case of a notification, which is stipulated as binding in Article
33(3) GDPR. Based on TIC’s comments on the Breach they provided pursuant to Article 33(5) GDPR and
on the description of the investigation of the facts of the case, TIC obviously did not fully comply with
its  documentation  obligation  when  it  first  reported  the Breach on  8  January  2019.  The DE  SA
considered that there are therefore numerous indications that the result could also be an infringement
of Article 33(3) GDPR.

6.2.7 Infringement of Article 34 GDPR on the communication of a personal data

breach to the data subject

91. The HU SA raised objections stating that given the “bug” in TIC’s application over the years and its
serious nature affecting data security, the IE SA had to investigate whether TIC infringed also Article
34 GDPR on TIC’s obligations of informing the data subjects about the Breach.

6.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

92. The LSA provided its response in respect of the objections concerning potential further (or alternative)
infringements of the GDPR collectively in its Composite Memorandum shared with the CSAs. The LSA
explained that it “exercised its discretion [...] to confine the scope of the Inquiry to the consideration of
two discrete issues, being whether TIC had complied with its obligations as a controller under Article
33(1) in respect of the notification of the Breach, and whether it had complied with its obligations under
Article 33(5) to document the Breach”91. The LSA relied on Section 110(1) of the Irish Data Protection
Act 2018, which provides that the IE SA may “cause such inquiry as it thinks fit to be conducted”92. The
purpose  of  the  inquiry  as  described  by  the  IE  SA  was  thus  “solely  to  examine  the  circumstances
surrounding TIC’s apparent delayed notification of the Breach [...] and its documenting of the Breach”,
an issue considered by the IE SA as “of considerable importance given that, with close to 200,000
breaches notified in two years across the EU, there is a need for clarity on what is required under the
breach notification and documentation requirements of the GDPR”93.

93. Within its Composite Memorandum94, the IE SA maintains that objections raised in the context of
Article 60(4) GDPR cannot have the effect of challenging the scope of an inquiry. In the case at hand,
the LSA recalls that it informed TIC at the beginning of the inquiry that its purpose was to verify TIC’s
compliance with Article 33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR in respect of its notification of a Breach to the
LSA 8 January 2019. The whole inquiry process was therefore conducted within that scope, as well as
the drafting of the Draft Decision, and TIC was afforded its right to be heard in that regard at each step
of the procedure. Therefore, the LSA maintains that if it were to follow the CSAs’ objections and include
other  infringements  in  its  final  decision “on  the  basis  of  only  the  material  contained  in  the  Draft
Decision”,  this  would  result  in  jeopardising  “the  entirety  of  the  Inquiry  and  Article  60  process  by
exposing it to the risk of claims of procedural unfairness”95.

93 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 1.9.

94. Furthermore, the LSA explains that it has another ongoing inquiry in relation to other data breaches
notified to the LSA by TIC prior to the notification that concerns the case at hand. In that other inquiry,
initiated before the one at hand, the LSA highlights that the scope of investigation concerns possible
non-compliance with “inter alia, Articles 5, 24, 25, 28, 29 and 32” GDPR96. The LSA considers that this
parallel  inquiry  is  indeed  assessing  TIC’s  compliance  with  its  broader  obligations  under  GDPR to
determine if compliance insufficiencies caused the data breaches. Consequently, the LSA is of the
position that the CSAs will have the possibility to consider such possible infringements in the context
of that other inquiry, as they will be consulted on its Draft Decision, in accordance with Article 60(4)
GDPR97.

95. TIC submitted that, since the Draft Decision states that “a detailed examination of the technical and
organisational  measures  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  inquiry”98,  it  “would  not  be  reasonable  or
appropriate, and would offend well-established principles of natural justice, if the Decision were to
make findings or impose sanctions on TIC in respect of obligations and principles which did not form
part of the DPC’s investigation, since TIC has not had an opportunity to address any concerns which the
DPC or CSAs may have about TIC’s processes in these areas”99.

6.4 Analysis of the EDPB

6.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

6.4.1.1

Infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR on the principle of integrity and confidentiality

96. The EDPB notes that the DE SA’s objection on Article 5(1)(f) GDPR is referring to whether there is an
infringement of the GDPR by expressing a disagreement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the
findings of the investigation. The objection also put forward arguments to support the conclusion that
compliance with Article 5(1)(f) GDPR should be assessed. The DE SA’s objection clearly demonstrates
the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms of data subjects,
in particular by highlighting that the facts amount to a “significant” and “substantial” breach of the
confidentiality of personal data and that a large number of persons were concerned for a substantial
period  of  time.  Furthermore  the  DE  SA  also  argued  that  there  were  indications  to  consider  the
existence “systemic error”, which would have required a deeper scrutiny beyond the single specific
bug involved.

97. The HU  SA’s  objection  can  also  be  considered  as  relevant  as  it  concerns  whether  there  is  an
infringement  of  the  GDPR.  Additionally  it  (only)  briefly  makes  reference  to  factual  arguments
supporting the need to assess this additional provision (the duration of the bug and its serious nature
affecting data security), but does not “clearly demonstrate” the significance of the risks posed by the
Draft Decision for risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals as it does not put forward arguments

attention by the IE SA, and TIC issued the aforementioned representations on the objections, which were taken
into  account  by  the  IE  SA  prior  to  the  initiation  of  the  Article  65  procedure  and  are  part  of  the  file  under
consideration of the EDPB in the context of this procedure. See also footnote 19.

or justifications concerning the consequences of issuing a decision without the changes proposed in
the objection100.

98. As a consequence the EDPB considers the objection raised by the DE SA in relation to the potential
additional infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR to be relevant and reasoned for the purposes of Article
4(24) GDPR, but considers the HU SA’s objection in relation to the same topic does not meet the
requirements of Article 4(24)101.

99. The EDPB will assess the merits of the substantial issues raised by the DE SA objection in relation to

the potential additional infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (see section 6.4.2 below).

6.4.1.2

Infringement of Article 5(2) GDPR on the principle of accountability

100. The objection raised by the IT SA is to be considered “relevant” since if followed, it would lead to a
different  conclusion  as  to  whether  there  is  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR102.  More  specifically,  it
includes a “disagreement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the investigation”,
since it states that the “findings amount to the infringement of a provision of the GDPR [...] in addition
to [...] those already analysed by the draft decision”103.

101. Additionally, the objection is “reasoned” as it includes clarifications as to why the amendment of the
decision is proposed104: the proposed change relies on the “lack of formalised corporate policies to
handle  security  incidents  [...]  or  the  failure  to  comply  with  said  policies”,  on  the  fact  that  such
“procedural shortcomings are highlighted by the [IE SA] repeatedly” in the Draft Decision, and on the
controller’s inability to state the exact number and nature of the personal data / data subjects affected.

102. The IT  SA clearly  demonstrated  the  significance  of  the  risks  posed  by  the  Draft  Decision  for
fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, by showing the “implications the draft decision
would have for the protected values”105 and more specifically the “impact on the rights and freedoms
of data subjects whose personal data might be processed in the future”106: the objection did so by
arguing that the aspects mentioned are “structural in nature as regards the controller’s organization”
and “bound to produce effects not simply on the case at issue, but also on the handling of any personal
data breach that may occur in the future”.

103. As a consequence, the IT SA’s objection on Article 5(2) GDPR meets the requirements set out in Article
4(24)  GDPR. The  EDPB  will  therefore analyse the  merits of  the substantial  issues raised  by  this
objection107.

6.4.1.3

Infringement of Article 24 GDPR on the responsibility of the controller

104. The DE  SA’s  objection  specifically  refers  to  Chapter  5  "Issues  for  determination"  of  the  Draft
Decision108, and objects to the Draft Decision as to whether Article 24 GDPR was also infringed by
TIC109. It relies on the facts110 set out in the Draft Decision that “if a Twitter user with a protected
account, using Twitter for Android, changed their email address the bug would result in their account
being unprotected”111. and their protected tweets were made publicly available via the service. More
precisely, the DE SA is questioning why the IE SA did not examine, in the Draft Decision, the causes of
the Breach, in particular in light of Article 24 GDPR, and why the IE SA did not explain in the Draft
Decision why it did not perform such examination.

105. The DE SA argues that given that the Breach notification revealed “deficiencies in compliance with the
GDPR, ... [a] company that is not capable by own means and resources, by inspections of internal or
external security teams to find a bug of that prominence and scope should be subject to a deeper
scrutiny regarding its security and data processing setup, beyond the single specific bug involved".

106. According to the DE SA, a higher scrutiny into TIC's data processing setup "could result, as the case may
be, in an order to the controller to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of
the GDPR. The case at hand fails to reflect this task. This makes it all the more urgent to examine the
corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR in this context".

107. Therefore,  the  DE  SA  pointed  out  what  it  considered  as  an  absence  of  assessment,  with  the
consequences that the conclusions drawn from the findings of the investigation by the LSA could be
different112.

108. The DE SA’s objection that “According to Art. 83 (1) GDPR, fines must be “effective, proportionate and
dissuasive in each individual case. A sanction is effective and dissuasive if, on the one hand, it is suitable
as a general preventive measure to deter the general public from committing infringements and to
affirm the general public’s confidence in the validity of Union law, but, on the other hand, it is also
suitable  as  a preventive  measure  to  deter  the  offender  from  committing  further  infringements”.
Consequently, the DE SA demonstrates how not changing the Draft Decision to include an assessment
of  compliance  with  Article  24  GDPR  would  pose  significant  risks  for  the  fundamental  rights  and
freedoms of data subjects113.

109. In its Guidelines on RRO, the EDPB accepts that an objection may challenge the conclusion of the LSA,
by considering that the LSA’s findings actually lead to the conclusion that another provision of the
GDPR has been infringed in addition to or instead of the provision identified by the LSA114. The EDPB
considers that this is precisely the essence of the DE SA’s objection, hence not preventing it from being
relevant and reasoned.

110. Additionally, the DE SA’s objection clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft
Decision for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, including by highlighting that a large number of
persons were concerned for an equally substantial period of time, reflecting a systemic error that calls

for deeper scrutiny, looking beyond the single specific bug involved. As a consequence, the DE SA’s
objection on Article 24 GDPR meets the threshold set out in Article 4(24) GDPR.

111. In light of the assessment above, the EDPB considers that the DE SA’s objection relating to a possible
infringement of Article 24 GDPR is relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR. As a
consequence, the EDPB is assessing the merit of the substantial issues raised by this objection (see
section 6.4.2 below).

6.4.1.4

Infringement of Article 28 GDPR on the relationship with processors

112. The FR SA’s objection specifically refers to paragraphs 7.129 iii), iv) and v) of the Draft Decision115, and
objects to the Draft Decision as to whether Article 28 GDPR was infringed by TIC instead of Article 33(1)
GDPR116. It relies on the facts117 set out in the Draft Decision and on the findings by the LSA that “TIC
did not respect the obligation of the controller to verify the validity of the procedures set up by its
processor”.

113. According to the FR SA, since Article 28(3)(h) GDPR sets forth the controller’s duties when it uses a
processor,  the  findings  should  have  led  the  LSA  to  the  conclusion  that  Article  28(3)(h)  GDPR  was
infringed, instead of Article 33(1) GDPR. Ultimately, it means, for the FR SA, that the sanction issued in
fine should address different infringements.

114. In its Guidelines on RRO, the EDPB accepts that an objection may challenge the conclusion of the LSA,
by considering that the LSA’s findings actually lead to the conclusion that another provision of the
GDPR has been infringed in addition to or instead of the provision identified by the LSA118. The EDPB
considers that this is precisely the essence of the FR SA’s objection, hence not preventing it from being
relevant. The objection also adequately puts forward arguments supporting the conclusion proposed.
At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  FR  SA’s  objection  does  not  clearly  demonstrate  the
significant risks posed by the Draft Decision for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects
with specific regard to the failure to conclude on the infringement of this specific provision119. In light
of this assessment, the EDPB considers that the FR SA’s objection relating to a possible infringement
of Article 28 GDPR instead of Article 33(1) GDPR is not relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article
4(24) GDPR120.

115. The IT SA’s objects to the Draft Decision as to whether Article 28 GDPR, inter alia, was infringed by TIC

in addition to Article 33(1) GDPR121.

116. The IT SA relies on the facts set out in the Draft Decision and on the findings by the LSA that whilst the
involvement of the Global DPO in the Detection and Response Team of its processor, Twitter, Inc., is
envisaged in TIC’s internal policies, in practice, the Global DPO was not involved. The IT SA also notes
that Twitter, Inc., as the processor, failed to assist TIC.

120 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of
the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

117. According to the IT SA, with Article 28(1) GDPR requiring controllers to only use processors providing
sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, and Article
28(3)(f) GDPR requiring the contract between the controller and the processor to stipulate that the
processor assist “the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to
36 taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the processor”;
the findings should have led the LSA to the conclusion that Article 28(1) and Article 28(3)(f) GDPR were
also infringed.

118. The EDPB considers that the IT objection in relation to Article 28(1) and Article 28(3)(f) GDPR it is to be
considered “relevant” since if followed, it would lead to a different conclusion as to whether there is
an infringement of the GDPR122. More specifically, it includes a “disagreement as to the conclusions to
be  drawn  from  the  findings  of the  investigation”,  since  it states that  the “findings  amount  to  the
infringement of a provision of the GDPR [...] in addition to [...] those already analysed by the draft
decision”123.

119. Additionally, according to the EDPB, the objection is “reasoned” as it includes clarifications as to why
the  amendment  of  the  decision  is  proposed124:  the  proposed  change  relies  on  the  fact  that  the
controller did not comply with its internal policies according to which TIC’s DPO should be involved.
Besides,  the  objection  raises  the  point  that  the  processor  failed  to  comply  with  its  contractual
obligation to assist the controller, in accordance with Article 28(3)(f) GDPR.

120. However, the EDPB notes that the IT SA’s objection relating to Article 28(1) and Article 28(3)(f) GDPR
does not clearly demonstrate significant risks posed by the Draft Decision for the fundamental rights
and freedoms of data subjects125. As a consequence this objection raised by the IT SA does not meet
the requirements set out in Article 4(24) GDPR126.

6.4.1.5

Infringement of Article 32 GDPR on the security of the processing

121. The DE  SA’s  objection,  if  followed,  would  entail  a  change  leading  to  a  different  conclusion  as  to
whether there is an infringement of the GDPR, since it identified a “disagreement as to the conclusions
to be drawn from the findings of the investigation”127 by pointing out that the findings may indicate an
infringement also of Article 32 GDPR. Thus, the EDPB therefore considers that there is a link between
the content of the objection and the potential different conclusion128. In addition, this objection is
related to specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision129.

122. Additionally, the DE SA’s objection clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft
Decision for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular by highlighting that the facts amount
to a “significant” and “substantial” breach of the confidentiality of personal data and that a large
number of persons were concerned for a substantial period of time. Furthermore the DE SA also argued

123 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27.
124 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 17.

126 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of
the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

129 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 14.

that there were indications to consider the existence of a “systemic error”, which would have required
a deeper scrutiny beyond the single specific bug involved.

123. In light of the assessment above, the EDPB considers that the DE SA’s objection relating to a possible
infringement of Article 32 GDPR is relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR. As a
consequence, the EDPB is assessing the merit of the substantial issues raised by this objection (see
point 6.4.2 below).

124. As regards the FR SA’s objection, the EDPB considers it as meeting the criterion of “relevant” because
if the LSA would have followed it, there would be a different conclusion as to whether there is an
infringement of the GDPR130. The FR SA’s objection is based on the reasoning provided by the IE SA in
its Draft Decision and this reasoning is linked with conclusion as to whether an infringement of the
GDPR has been correctly identified131. The EDPB recalls that the CSA has to present the facts allegedly
leading to a different conclusion132 and notes that in the case at stake the objection analyses the facts
that would lead to the violation of Article 32(1)(d) GDPR, instead of violation of Article 33(1) GDPR,
and does so in a coherent, clear and precise way, by clearly indicating which parts of the decision of
the IE SA it disagrees with. The FR SA’s objection is clearly relevant by outlining a disagreement on
whether an infringement of the GDPR has taken place. However, the FR SA’s objection only succinctly
explains the reasons for its proposed change and does not clearly demonstrate the significance of the
risks posed by the Draft Decision as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects in
relation to the failure to find an infringement of Article 32 GDPR. As a consequence this objection
raised by the FR SA does not meet the requirements set out in Article 4(24) GDPR133.

125. The HU SA’s objection also referred to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR, arguing that the
possible infringement of the principle of integrity and confidentiality should also be investigated. The
HU SA’s objection is clearly relevant by outlining that an additional provision of the GDPR (i.e. Article
32 GDPR) should have been investigated. However, the HU SA does not explain how the Draft Decision
would pose such risks, nor does it fully explain why specific aspects of the decision are deficient in its
point of view134. The HU SA’s objection fails to meet the criterion of providing sound reasoning for its
objection, by referring to legal or factual arguments. On the contrary, it just recommends that the IE
SA would also need to investigate the controller’s compliance with Article 32 GDPR. As a consequence
this objection raised by the HU SA does not meet the requirements set by Article 4(24) GDPR135.

6.4.1.6

Infringement of Article 33(3) GDPR on the content of the notification of a personal data
breach on security of processing

126. The DE SA considers that the Draft Decision indicates that Article 33(3) GDPR could be infringed in
addition to other provisions of GDPR. In that sense, it is about “whether there is an infringement” of

130 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 13.
131 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 16.
132 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 18.
133 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of

the GDPR, and that it has not been examined and addressed by the Draft Decision. Hence, the DE SA
considers that, if changed, the Draft Decision would lead to the conclusion of additional infringements
of GDPR.

127. However, the DE SA does not clearly demonstrate the significant risks posed by the Draft Decision to
the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. As a consequence, the DE SA’s objection on
Article 33(3) GDPR fails to meet the requirements set out in Article 4(24) GDPR136.

6.4.1.7

Infringement of Article 34 GDPR on the communication of a personal data breach to the
data subject

128. The HU  SA considers  that  the  Draft  Decision  indicates  that  Article  34  GDPR  could  be  infringed  in
addition to other provisions of GDPR, especially in light of the fact that the bug lasted over the years,
and given the serious nature affecting the controller’s security. In that sense, it is about “whether there
is  an  infringement”  of  the  GDPR,  and  that  it  has  not  been  examined  and  addressed  by  the  Draft
Decision. Hence, the HU SA considers that, if changed, the Draft Decision would lead to the conclusion
of additional infringements of GDPR.

129. However, the HU SA does not clearly demonstrate the significant risks posed by the Draft Decision to
the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. As a consequence, the HU SA’s objection on
Article 34 GDPR do not meet the requirements set out in Article 4(24) GDPR137.

6.4.2 Assessment of the merits of the substantial issue(s) raised by the relevant and

reasoned objections and conclusion

130. The Board now analyses the objections found being relevant and reasoned - in particular the DE SA’s
objections on Article 5(1)(f), Article 24 and 32 GDPR, as well the IT SA’s objection on Article 5(2) GDPR
- as well as the LSA’s response to those objections and the TIC submissions.

131. In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB
shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR. The EDPB can (and
must) make a binding decision which shall whenever possible, taking into account the elements of the
file and the respondent’s right to be heard, provide a final conclusion on the application of the GDPR
in relation to the case at hand. The LSA will then be obliged to implement the changes in its final
decision.

132. The  Board  considers  that the available  factual elements included in  the Draft  Decision  and  in  the
objections are not sufficient to allow the EDPB to establish the existence of further (or alternative)
infringements of Article 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24 and 32 GDPR.

133. The Board considers that, as a general matter, the limited scope of the inquiry by the IE SA - focused
since the outset only on whether there were infringements by TIC of Article 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR -

136 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of
the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

directly affects the remit of the investigation and further fact finding, as well as the ability for CSAs to
put forward sufficient elements for the EDPB to sustain the objections.

134. The EDPB recalls the duty for the LSA to “endeavour to reach consensus” with the CSAs (Article 60(1)
GDPR) and to provide, without delay, the CSAs with “the relevant information” on the matter (Article
60(3)  GDPR).  Even  in  case  of  an  own-volition  inquiry,  the Guidelines on  reasoned  and  relevant
objections state that LSA “should seek consensus regarding the scope of the procedure (i.e. the aspects
of data processing under scrutiny) prior to initiating the procedure formally”138, including in the context
of a possible new proceeding.

135. Whilst the EDPB considers that SAs enjoy certain degree of discretion to decide how to frame the scope
of their inquiries, the EDPB recalls that one of the main objectives of the GDPR is to ensure consistency
throughout the European Union, and the cooperation between the LSA and CSAs is one of the means
to achieve this. The EDPB also recalls the existence of a full range of the cooperation tools provided
for by the GDPR (including Articles 61 and 62 GDPR), bearing in mind the goal of reaching consensus
within the cooperation mechanism and the need to exchange all relevant information, with a view to
ensuring protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects.

136. The EDPB considers that in determining the scope of the inquiry, whilst it can be limited, a LSA should
frame it in such a way that it permits the CSAs to effectively fulfil their role, alongside the LSA, when
determining whether there has been an infringement of the GDPR.

7 ON  THE  CORRECTIVE  MEASURES  DECIDED  BY  THE  LSA -

IN

PARTICULAR, THE IMPOSITION OF A REPRIMAND

7.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

137. The  Draft  Decision  explains  that,  while  in  the Preliminary  Draft  Decision the  proposed  corrective
powers  to  be  imposed  were  both  a  reprimand,  pursuant  to  Article  58(2)(b)  GDPR,  and  an
administrative fine, pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, the final Draft Decision consists of the imposition
only of an administrative fine on TIC as the controller139.

138. In its submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft Decision, TIC objected to the decision to issue a
reprimand, contending that the infringements of Article 33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR do not comprise
“processing operations”, while Article 58(2)(b) GDPR provides supervisory authorities with the power
to  issue  reprimands  where  processing  operations  have  infringed  provisions  of  the  GDPR140.  TIC’s
argument mainly relied on the fact that neither the delay in notifying the SA nor the failure to keep
appropriate records amounts to a processing operation in itself141.

139. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA explained its decision not to issue a reprimand by recalling the argument
put forward by TIC in its submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft Decision, contending that the
infringements of Article 33(1) and Article 33(5) GDPR do not comprise “processing operations”, while
Article  58(2)(b)  GDPR  provides  supervisory  authorities  with  the  power  to  issue  reprimands  where
processing operations have infringed provisions of the GDPR142. The IE SA considered that the term

140 TIC’s submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft Decision, paragraph 11.1.

142 TIC’s submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft Decision, paragraph 11.1.

Adopted

32

‘processing operation(s)’ appears 50 times in the GDPR and seems to be used to denote the treatment
or use of, in other words things that are done to, personal data controlled by a controller, but that at
the same time the definition of “processing” provided by the GDPR is very broad, which makes it
arguable that given that a breach is something affecting or done to, personal data, it follows that the
notification obligation (insofar as it inherently must entail an examination of what has happened to
personal  data  or  how  it  has  been  affected)  is  intrinsically  connected  to  one  or  more  processing
operations143. The IE SA did not consider it necessary to definitely conclude on the meaning and effect
of the term “processing operations” in the Draft Decision, but “on balance” considered that TIC’s legal
argument was “a stateable one”, deciding not to proceed with the issuing of a reprimand to TIC144.

7.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

140. The DE SA raised an objection concerning the fact that while in the Preliminary Draft Decision both a
reprimand  and  a  fine  were  envisaged,  only  a  fine  was included in  the Draft  Decision.  The  DE  SA
disagreed  with  the  reasoning  put  forward  by  the  IE  SA  concerning  the  decision  to  not  impose  a
reprimand. According to the DE SA, the legal reasoning accepted by the LSA as “stateable” is not
convincing as the legal interpretation requires not only an examination of the wording of the provision,
but also of its meaning and purpose, the history of its development and its systematic integration into
the entire regulatory complex.

7.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

141. In its Composite Memorandum, the IE SA considered that whereas the DE SA’s objection does relate
to “whether envisaged action in relation to a controller or processor complies with [the GDPR]”, it does
not demonstrate how not issuing a reprimand to TIC could lead to significant risks for data subjects145
on the decision to not issue a reprimand was not relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article
4(24) GDPR.

142. Nonetheless  addressing  the  merits of  the  substantial  issue(s)  raised  by  the  objections,  the  LSA
explained that it considered the term “processing operations” in accordance with its meaning and
application throughout the whole GDPR, noticing that this term is only used for SAs’ powers under
Article 58 GDPR. Following TIC’s submissions in its response to the CSAs’ objections on that point, the
LSA decided, having regard to the scope of the inquiry that focussed on the controller’s obligations in
relation  to  the  Breach  notification,  that  its  inquiry  “did  not  involve  a  finding  that  the  underlying
‘processing operations’  relating  to  the  Breach  infringed  [...]  the  GDPR”146.  Therefore,  the  LSA
considered that there was no reason to review its decision to not issue a reprimand in light of the DE
SA’s objection.

143. The LSA noted that its position in the Draft Decision to not issue a reprimand is only applicable to the
specific circumstances of this case; hence is without any prejudice for future decisions on reprimands
that could be made by the LSA or any other CSA147.

143 Draft Decision, paragraph 12.5.
144 Draft  Decision,  paragraph  12.5.  The  other  separate  arguments  made  by  TIC  concerning  reasons  why  the
imposition of a reprimand was not considered appropriate (TIC’s submissions in relation to the Preliminary Draft
Decision, paragraphs 11.2-11.4) were not considered separately, in light of the aforementioned decision (Draft
Decision, paragraph 12.6).

7.4 Analysis of the EDPB

7.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

144. The DE SA objection refers to the compliance of the envisaged action with the GDPR, as it indicates
what corrective action would, in its view, be appropriate for the LSA to include in the final decision: it
is  therefore  a  relevant  objection,  which  adequately  shows  the  different  conclusion  proposed.
Furthermore,  it  includes  legal  reasoning  supporting  its  view  and  proposes  an  alternative  legal
interpretation. Nevertheless, the objection does not clearly demonstrate the significance of the risk
posed by the Draft Decision for rights and freedoms of data subjects and/or the free flow of personal
data. In particular, it does not provide motivation on how the failure to impose a reprimand in this
specific case - where a fine is also imposed - may trigger risks for data subjects’ fundamental rights and
freedoms.

7.4.2 Conclusion

145. The EDPB considers that this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

146. The EDPB notes the LSA position that its position to not issue a reprimand is only applicable to the
specific circumstances of this case; hence is without any prejudice for future decisions on reprimands
that could be made by the LSA or any other CSA148.

147. As previously indicated, the decision of the EDPB not to assess the merits of the substance of the

objection raised is without prejudice to future EDPB decisions on the same or on similar issues.

8 ON  THE  CORRECTIVE  MEASURES

-

IN  PARTICULAR,  THE

CALCULATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINE

8.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

148. The Draft Decision explains how the IE SA considered the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR in deciding

whether to impose an administrative fine and how to determine its amount149.

149. As  regards the  calculation  of  the  fine,  the Draft  Decision  analysed,  first, the  nature,  gravity  and
duration of the infringement, as per Article 83(2)(a) GDPR150. The Draft Decision took into account the
“nature, scope or purpose of the processing” by referring to the nature of the processing operations
carried  on  by  Twitter  (a  “microblogging”  and  social  media  platform  on which  users  have  the
opportunity to document their thoughts in “tweets”), to the nature of the processing that gave rise to
the Breach (arising from a bug leading to previously ‘protected’ tweets becoming ‘unprotected’ and
publicly accessible - in cases where Android users changed the email address), and to the scope of the
processing (the bug affected at least 88,726 EU/EEA users, as additional people were affected between

148 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 5.78.
149 Draft Decision, paragraphs 14.1-14.62.
150 Article 83(2)(a) GDPR refers to “the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the
level of damage suffered by them”.

Adopted

34

the date of the bug on 4 November 2014 and its full remediation on 14 January 2019 but it was not
possible for them to be all identified)151.

150. The Draft Decision also  took  into account the  number  of  data  subjects  affected  and  the  level  of
damage suffered by them152 by concluding that the number of data subjects who could have been
potentially affected by the delayed notification and the potential for damage to data subjects arising
from the consequent delayed assessment by the SA were relevant factors to take into consideration153.
It was recalled that the impact on individual users and the possibility of damage arising therefrom will
impact on the level and nature of the personal data made public and that there was at least a potential
for damage to data subjects linked to the delaying of remedial actions154. The position of the IE SA in
the Preliminary Draft was that “whilst TIC had not confirmed the precise nature of the data made public
in the Breach, it was reasonable to deduce that, given the scale of the affected users and the nature of
the service offered by TIC, some of the personal data released in relation to, at least, some of the users
will have included sensitive categories of data and other particularly private material”155. This position
was further nuanced in the Draft Decision in light of TIC’s submissions, as the IE SA decided that “less
weight should be attributed to this factor”, on the basis of the fact that “while it cannot be definitively
said that no users affected by the Breach were affected by the delayed notification, there was no direct
evidence of damage to them arising from the delayed notification”156.

151. With respect to the nature of the infringement, the Draft Decision highlighted that the infringements
of Articles 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR do not relate to the substantive matter of the Breach157. The IE SA
also considered that the nature of the obligations under Articles 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR are such that
compliance is central to the overall functioning of the supervision and enforcement regime performed
by supervisory authorities in relation to both the specific issue of personal data breaches but also the
identification and  assessment  of  wider  issues  of  non-compliance  by  controllers  and  that  non-
compliance with such obligations has serious consequences in that it risks undermining the effective
exercise by SAs of their functions under the GDPR158.

152. With regard to the gravity of the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR, the Draft Decision took account
of how it interfered with the overall purpose of notifying a personal data breach to the supervisory
authority, of the fact that no material damage to data subjects was shown, of the fact that the remedial
measures by TIC were limited to forward looking action to close down the bug (and did not amount to
a backward looking analysis to identify the risks to data subjects arising from the Breach) and TIC’s
apparent failure to carry out any formal risk assessment159. The Draft Decision did not consider TIC’s
contention that the Breach was due to an isolated failure (which led to the delay in notifying the DPO)
to be of sufficient weight as to lessen the gravity of the infringement (but did take into account of such
isolated nature of the incident, departing from the provisional view in the Preliminary Draft that the

Breach was indicative of a broader, more systemic issue)160. Concerning the gravity of the infringement
of  Article  33(5)  GDPR, the  Draft  Decision  highlighted  that  proper  documentation  of  breaches  is
required in order to enable a supervisory authority to verify the controller’s compliance with Article
33 GDPR161 and that the IE SA was required to raise multiple queries in order to gain clarity concerning
the facts surrounding the notification of the Breach162, but acknowledged that the deficiencies in the
documentation arose from a good faith misunderstanding of the requirements (which are, however,
clear from the wording of the provision)163. The Draft Decision concluded that each infringement was
at the “low to moderate end of the scale of gravity”164.

153. With regard to the duration of the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR, the Draft Decision considered
that it was a period of two days and evaluated it in light of the overall timeframe generally permitted
for  breach  notifications  (72  hours),  noting  that  it  was  not  a  trivial  or  inconsequential  one165.
Concerning the duration of the infringement of Article 33(5) GDPR, the Draft Decision concluded that
it was ongoing166.

154. In relation to Article 83(2)(b) GDPR (the intentional or negligent character of the infringement), the IE
SA concluded in its Draft Decision that there was a negligent character to TIC’s infringement of Article
33(1) GDPR167, outlining that the delay in the notification of the Global DPO occurred because part of
the internal protocol of the Twitter Group was not completed as prescribed and the protocol was not
as  clear  as  it  could  have  been168.  This  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the delay  arose  as  a  result  of  a
negligence on the part of the controller, but TIC’s submission that the delayed notification was not
indicative of a broader systemic issue and amounted to an isolated occurrence was accepted169. The IE
SA did not identify any evidence of intentional conduct with regard to the infringement of Article 33(1)
GDPR170. The Draft Decision also identified that there was a negligent character to TIC’s infringement
of Article 33(5) GDPR171, since there was no knowledge and wilfulness to cause the infringement (which
would have amounted to intent) but the documentation was not sufficient to enable compliance with
Article 33 to be verified172.

155. As regards Article 83(2)(c) GDPR, i.e. action taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered
by data subjects, the Draft Decision considered that remedial measures were taken to avoid repetition
of the issue and to rectify the bug, which were considered as the sole mitigating factor in assessing the
amount of the fine to be imposed173.

implemented by TIC as controller, including the amendment of the internal protocol of the Twitter
Group (which the IE SA found was not as clear as it could have been) and the staff training measures
taken  afterwards by  Twitter,  Inc.(additional  training  was  provided  internally  highlighting  the
importance  of  mentioning the  DPO  team - and  therefore  TIC  as  controller - in  the  internal  ticket
system), as well as the existence of internal structures and safeguards concerning responsibility for
information security issues and the existence of a recurring external third party expert audit of Twitter,
Inc.’s  Information  Security  Programme174. Although the  issues  that  arose  were  not found  to  be
indicative of a broader systemic issue175 and TIC demonstrated a generally responsible and accountable
approach  towards  data  security176, it was  considered  that  there  was  a  moderate  to  high  level  of
responsibility demonstrated by the controller as a lack of clarity in the protocol was shown also by its
subsequent amendment177.

157. The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority was evaluated, in line with Article 83(2)(f)
GDPR,  and  was  found  to  not  amount  to  a  mitigating  factor178.  The  IE  SA  acknowledged  that  TIC
cooperated fully but noted that this was a statutory obligation and TIC did not go beyond such duty179.
158. In relation to Article 83(2)(g) GDPR concerning the categories of personal data affected, the Draft
Decision concluded  that  any  category  of  personal  data  could  have  been  affected  by  the  delayed
notification and that it cannot be definitively said that there was no damage to data subjects or no
affected categories of personal data180.

159. The manner in which infringement became known to the IE SA was considered to be a relevant factor
in the determination of the amount of the fine (in line with Article 83(2)(h) GDPR), since while TIC was
forthcoming in furnishing all available documentation the records did not allow the IE SA to verify
compliance with Article 33 GDPR and the information originally provided in the notification made to
the IE SA was of an imprecise nature181.

160. The  criteria  in Article  83(2)(e),  (i)  and  (j)  GDPR were  found  to  be  not  applicable, and  no  further

elements were identified in relation to Article 83(2)(k) GDPR182.

161. The IE SA underlined in its Draft Decision that in the absence of specific EU-level guidelines on the
calculation of fines, it was not bound to apply any particular methodology or use a fixed financial
starting point183 and that the expression “due regard” provides SAs with a broad discretion as to how
to weigh the factors in Article 83(2) GDPR184.

162. As regards the identification of the relevant undertaking to calculate the fining cap established by
Article 83(4) GDPR, the IE SA underlined that the fact that TIC enjoys autonomy in its control over data
processing does not mean that it ceases to be part of a single economic entity with its parent company

and noted that, in addition to the ownership of TIC by Twitter, Inc., the General Counsel of Twitter,
Inc. appears to be one of the three directors of TIC185.

163. For this reasons, the cap for the value of any fine imposed was calculated by the LSA with reference to
Twitter, Inc.’s turnover186. As the annual turnover of Twitter, Inc., in 2018, amounted to 3 billion USD,
the cap was considered to be 60 million USD (2% of 3 billion USD)187.

164. In applying the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1) GDPR),
the Draft Decision considered that a fine cannot be effective if it does not have significance relative to
the  revenue  of  the  controller,  that the  infringement needs  to  not  be considered  in  the  abstract,
regardless of the impact on the controller, and that future infringements need to be deterred188.

165. The IE SA proposed to impose an administrative fine within the range of 150,000-300,000 USD, i.e.
between 0.005% and 0.01% of the undertaking’s annual turnover or between 0.25% and 0.5% of the
maximum amount of the fine which may be applied in respect of these infringements. This equates to
a fine in Euro of between 135,000 and 275,000189.

8.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

166. The AT SA raised an objection concerning the amount of the proposed fine and the fact that the LSA
proposed a range of amounts instead of a fixed sum. With regard to Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, the AT SA
highlighted that at least 88,726 people (but probably more) were affected by the Breach and “it is very
likely that sensitive data were disclosed to the broader public”.

167. The objection raised by the AT SA expressed a disagreement as to how the time at which the controller
should be deemed to be aware of a data breach was analysed in the Draft Decision. More specifically,
the AT SA argued in its objection that TIC should have made a data breach notification within 72 hours
after the  processor received  the  bug  report  and  thus  became  aware  of  the  Breach.  The  AT  SA
highlighted  that  TIC  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  processing  operations  carried  out  by  its
processor, and that a controller should not seek to hide the failure of its processor with whom it has a
contractual  relationship  and  which  was  selected  by  the  controller  itself. This  contributes  to  the
assessment of the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR by the AT SA as “grave”.

168. With regard to the “intentional or negligent character of the infringement” (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR), the
AT SA argued that the behaviour of TIC should be labelled as “intentional”, on the basis of the criteria
of  knowledge  and  wilfulness  established  in  the  Guidelines  on  the  application  and  setting  of
administrative fines (“WP253”) of the Article 29 Working Party, endorsed by the EDPB190. As to the
criterion referring to actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects (Article 83(2)(c)
GDPR), the AT SA highlighted that “initially it was not TIC’s intention to notify users who were affected
by the breach” and “the steps taken by Twitter Inc. to rectify the bug are the sole mitigating factor”.

the Preliminary Draft Decision, in order to reflect changes in the views in relation to gravity, the degree of
responsibility of the controller and whether the infringements were systemic). In paragraph 15.21, the Draft
Decision underlined that in order to protect TIC’s procedural rights a range of a fine was proposed as opposed
to a fixed figure, and acknowledged the possibility that CSAs would comment on where in that range the
penalty should lie.

Finally, AT SA considers the range of fine proposed by the IE SA neither effective, nor proportionate,
nor dissuasive having regard to the criteria listed in Article 83(2)(a) – (k) GDPR. As a conclusion, the AT
SA proposed the imposition of a higher administrative fine, which could meet the requirement of
effectiveness,  proportionality  and  dissuasiveness  (namely  “a  minimum  amount  of  1  %  of  the
undertaking’s annual turnover”).

169. The DE SA raised an objection arguing that the fine proposed by the LSA is “too low” and “does not
comply with the provisions of Article 83(1) GDPR”. More specifically, the DE SA argued that the fine is
not dissuasive. The objection recalled that a sanction can be deemed effective and dissuasive if it is
suitable both as  a  general  preventive  measure - to  deter  the  general public  from  committing
infringements and to affirm the general public's confidence in the validity of Union law - and as a
special preventive measure - to deter the offender from committing further infringements. The DE SA
goes on to argue that the financial capacity of an undertaking (in terms of turnover) can provide an
important indication of the amounts required to achieve dissuasiveness: this may entail taking into
account the part of the turnover generated by the products in respect of which the infringement has
been committed, which may provide an indication of the scale of the infringements. The DE SA also
argues that the dissuasive effect of high fines can only be achieved if the amounts imposed cannot be
easily paid because of large assets or high income, highlighting that the fine must have a dissuasive
effect, particularly in relation to specific data processing. As a consequence, the threatened fine must
be high enough to make data processing uneconomic and objectively inefficient. As Twitter’s business
model is based on processing data, and as Twitter generates turnover mainly through data processing,
the DE SA considers that a dissuasive fine in this specific case would therefore have to be so high that
it would render the illegal data processing unprofitable. On the basis of the fine concept applicable to
the  DE  SAs,  the  fine  for  the  infringement  described  in  the Draft  Decision would  range  from
approximately EUR 7,348,035.00 to EUR 22,044,105.00.

170. The HU SA argued that, although “fines are justified for the committed infringements”, “the fine set
out in the draft is unreasonably low, disproportionate and thus not dissuasive in view of the gravity of
the committed infringement and the Controller’s worldwide market power”.

171. The IT  SA asked  the  LSA  to  “review  the  draft  decision  as  also  related  to  quantification  of  the
administrative fine, taking also account of specific aggravating elements of the case with regard to the
nature of the data controller and the severity and duration of the data breach”.

8.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

172. The IE  SA  assessed  that  the  objections  raised  by  the  AT  SA,  DE  SA  and  HU  SA  in  relation  to  the
administrative fine to be ‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR. At the
same  time,  the  IE  SA  did  not  follow  these  objections  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  Composite
Memorandum191.

173. In particular, as regards to the AT and DE SA's objections, the IE SA considers that its assessment and
application  of  the  factors  at  Articles  83(2)(a)  and  (b)  GDPR,  as  elaborated  in  its Draft  Decision,  is
appropriate. Regarding the AT SA's objection, the IE SA argues that TIC's infringement of Article 33(1)
and  Article  33(5) GDPR was  the  result  of  TIC's  negligence  rather  than  an  intentional  omission192.
Therefore, the IE SA believes that the fine as proposed by the AT SA is not proportionate193. In addition,

192 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 5.62.
193 Composite Memorandum, paragraph 5.63.

Adopted

39

the  IE  SA  argues  that  the  concern  of  the  AT  SA  regarding  the  fining  range  proposed  in  the Draft
Decision, as opposed to a fixed sum, was not well elaborated and clarified by this CSA194. With regard
to the DE SA's objection, the IE SA took note of the objection of the DE SA regarding the need for the
fine to meet the requirement of dissuasiveness, but is of the opinion that the level of the fine proposed
by the DE SA is not proportionate in this case195. For the above-mentioned reasons, the IE SA considers
these objections are reasoned and relevant, but proposes not to follow them196.

174. The IE SA has taken due account of the AT SA’s view in relation to the timing of TIC’s awareness and
notification of the Breach but concluded that notwithstanding TIC’s actual ‘awareness’ of the Breach
on 7 January 2019, TIC ought to have been aware of the Breach at the latest by 3 January 2019197. In
identifying 3 January 2019 as the date on which TIC ought to have been aware of the breach, the IE SA
took into account that an earlier delay had arisen during the period from when the incident was first
notified by a contractor to Twitter, Inc. to when Twitter, Inc. commenced its review198. Further, the IE
SA  clarifies  that  it  is  not  suggesting that,  "as  a  matter  of  generality,  data  controllers  ought  to
automatically  be  considered  to  have  awareness  of  data  breaches at  the  same  time  at  which  their
processor becomes aware of the breach"199. Also, the IE SA states that "it will usually be the case that
a processor which experiences a breach will be aware of the incident at an earlier point in time than its
controller, and that, provided the process agreed between the controller and the processor is effective
and / or is followed, the controller will be made ‘aware’ of the breach [...] in a manner that enables it
to comply with its obligation to notify same"200.

8.4 Analysis of the EDPB

8.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

175. Concerning  the  possibility  for  relevant  and  reasoned  objections  on  whether  envisaged  action  in
relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR201 to challenge the amount of proposed
fines, the EDPB recently clarified that “it is possible that the objection challenges the elements relied
upon to calculate the amount of the fine”202. This can amount to an example of objection concerning
whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR.

176. In  the  case  at  stake,  the AT  SA’s  objection  challenges  the  elements  relied  upon  by  the  IE  SA  in
calculating the amount of the fine and thus concerns the compliance of the proposed action vis-a-vis
the controller with the GDPR. The AT SA clarified the connection between its objection and the Draft
Decision and  demonstrated  how  the  proposed  changes  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion.
Additionally, it provided arguments on why the amendment of the decision is proposed, by providing
an alternative interpretation of three of the criteria listed by Article 83 GDPR and by making reference
to factual and legal arguments. The AT SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by
the Draft  Decision,  first  of  all,  by  arguing  that  the  proposed  fine  is  not  adequately  effective  and
dissuasive  and  by  recalling  that  to  this  end  it  needs  to  be  likely  to  deter  the  general  public  from
committing a similar infringement and confirm the public’s confidence in the application of Union law,

as  well  as  to  deter  the  controller  from  committing  further infringements.  Additionally,  in  the
assessment of the gravity of the infringement the objection also refers to the extent to which data
subjects (in a number likely to be higher than the one identified) were affected by the Breach (e.g. by
having their previously protected tweets, likely to include sensitive data, exposed to the wider public).
The alleged intentionality of the infringement, according to the AT SA, implies a far greater impact on
the ability to know right from wrong than a negligent infringement. In light of the assessment above,
the EDPB considers that the AT SA’s objection is relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24)
GDPR.  As  a  consequence,  the  EDPB  will  assess  the  merit  of  the  substantial  issues  raised  by  this
objection (see section 8.4.2 below).

177. The DE SA’s objection is also to be considered relevant as it concerns the compliance of the envisaged
action with the GDPR, by challenging the elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine.
More specifically, it argues that the fine imposed by the IE SA is not dissuasive and thus the calculation
performed  does  not  comply  with  Article  83(1) GDPR.  The  DE  SA  clarified  that a  sanction  is  to  be
considered effective and dissuasive, when it serves as a general preventive measure to deter general
public from committing infringements as well as to affirm its trust to the validity of the Union law, but
also when it deters the offender from committing additional infringements. In addition, the DE SA
clearly  demonstrates  the  significance  of  the  risks  that  the Draft  Decision poses  to  the  rights  and
freedoms of the data subjects as the failure to impose a dissuasive and effective sanction may not be
able to deter the controller from committing further infringements.

178. Another argument provided by the DE SA to demonstrate the significance of the risks is that the failure
to appropriately handle the Breach suggests a “systemic error”, which would have required submitting
the controller to a deeper scrutiny, beyond the single specific incident. The DE SA also recalled that a
large number of persons was concerned and the period of time was equally substantial and concluded
that the corrective powers imposed on the basis of Article 58(2) GDPR need to be examined in light of
these elements. To conclude, the EDPB considers that the DE SA’s objection is reasoned and relevant
within the definition of Article 4(24) GDPR. As a consequence, the EDPB will assess the merit of the
substantial issues raised by this objection (see section 8.4.2 below).

179. The HU SA’s objection is relevant as it also concerns the compliance of the envisaged action with the
GDPR,  by  stating  that  the  proposed  fine  is  “unreasonably  low,  disproportionate  and  thus  not
dissuasive”. However, while the objection refers to “the “bug” in the controller’s application over the
years” and to “its serious nature affecting data security”, as well as to the “gravity of the committed
infringement” and to the “controller’s worldwide market power”, it does not clearly demonstrate the
significance of the risks for rights and freedoms of data subjects posed by the amount of the fine as
proposed  by  the  IE  SA. As  a  consequence, the  EDPB  considers this  objection does  not meet  the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR203.

180. Last, the relevance of the objection raised by the IT SA is also shown by its reference to whether the
proposed action complies with the GDPR, as it argues that the IE SA should review the Draft Decision
in relation to the quantification of the administrative fine. By referring to the “foregoing objections”
and thus to the fact that the aspects mentioned are “structural in nature as regards the controller's
organisation” and “bound to produce effects not simply on the case at issue, but also on any data

203 As a consequence, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by these
objections. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of
the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

Adopted

41

breach that may occur in the future”, the IT SA’s objection clearly demonstrates the significance of the
risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects with respect to the quantification of the fine.

181. Therefore, EDPB  considers  that  the  IT  SA’s  objection  is  reasoned  and  relevant meeting the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. As a consequence, the EDPB will assess the merit of the substantial
issues raised by this objection.

8.4.2 Assessment of the merits of the substantial issue(s) raised by the relevant and

reasoned objections

182. The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection204 require
the assessment of whether the Draft Decision proposes a fine in line with the criteria established by
Article  83  GDPR  and  the  Article 29  Working  Party  Guidelines  on  the  application  and  setting of
administrative  fines  for  the  purposes  of  the  Regulation  2016/679 (“WP253”) (endorsed  by  the
EDPB)205.

183. Indeed,  the consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent  application  of
administrative fines206: where a relevant and reasoned objection challenges the elements relied upon
by the LSA to calculate the amount of the fine, the EDPB can instruct the LSA to engage in a new
calculation of the proposed fine by eliminating the shortcomings in the establishment of causal links
between the facts at issue and the way the proposed fine was calculated on the basis of the criteria in
Article 83 GDPR and of the common standards established by the EDPB207. A fine should be effective,
proportionate  or  dissuasive,  as  required  by  Article  83(1)  GDPR, taking  account  of  the facts of  the
case208. In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine the LSA shall take into consideration the
criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.

184. As regards the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement found in Articles 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR,
Article 83(2)(a) GDPR requires to take into consideration inter alia the nature, scope and purpose of
the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage
suffered by them.

185. The EDPB agrees with the IE SA that the infringement to consider is not the Breach as such but the
compliance  with  Articles 33(1)  and  33(5)  GDPR to  notify  that  breach to  the  competent  SA  and  to
document that breach.

186. The EDPB notes that the IE SA takes into account the nature of the processing as well as the number
of  data  subjects  affected. As  regards  the nature  of  the  processing,  the  IE  SA  describes  as  a
“microblogging” and social media platform on which users have the opportunity to document their
thoughts in “tweets”. The EDPB considers that when assessing the nature of the processing, one must
also take into consideration the fact the “processing concerned” involved communications by data
subjects who deliberately chose to restrict the audience of those communications. The EDPB takes
note that the IE SA Draft Decision considered that: “the impact on individual users, and the possibility
of damage arising therefrom, will depend on the level of personal data made public and, also, the
nature of that personal data. In this regard, I indicated in the Preliminary Draft that whilst TIC had not

confirmed the precise nature of the data made public in the Breach, it was reasonable to deduce that,
given the scale of the affected users and the nature of the service offered by TIC, some of the personal
data released in relation to, at least, some of the users will have included sensitive categories of data
and other particularly private material”209. However, the IE SA, based on TIC submissions, gave less
weight to this factor than it did in the Preliminary Draft, as there was no direct evidence of damage210.
The EDPB considers, however, that the IE SA should still have given significant weight to the fact that
the “processing  concerned”  involves communications  by  data  subjects who  deliberately  chose  to
restrict  the  audience  of  those  communications,  when  evaluating  the  nature  of  the  processing
concerned. In particular, the IE SA should have given significant weight to this fact given that it was
recalled by the IE SA in the Draft Decision, where the IE SA considered that "the large scale of the
affected user segment gives rise to the possibility of a much broader spectrum of damage arising from
the Breach, particularly given the nature of the service being offered by TIC" and "the likelihood that
many users will have relied on the function of keeping “tweets” private to share information or views
(in the comfort of what they believe to be a private and controlled environment) that they would not
ordinarily release into the public domain"211.

187. Moreover, when it comes to the scope of the processing concerned as such, the IE SA appears to
substitute  the  scope  of  the  processing  with  the  number  of  the  data  subjects affected.  The  EDPB
considers  that  the nature  and  the  scope of  the “processing”  to  take  into  consideration  in  the
determination  of  the  fine  is  not  the  processing  operation  consisting  in  the  (accidental)  disclosure
(personal data breach), or the cause thereof, but rather the scope of the underlying processing carried
out by TIC, as described in the previous paragraph.

188. According to the AT SA, the timing when the controller became aware of the breach impacts on the
gravity of the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR. The objection raised by the AT SA expressed a
disagreement as to how the time at which the controller should be deemed to be aware of a data
breach should be determined or assessed. More specifically, the AT SA argued in its objection that TIC
should have made a data breach notification within 72 hours after the processor became aware of the
bug. This contributes to the assessment of the infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR by the AT SA as
“grave”.

189. In  this  respect,  the  EDPB  recalls  that the  Guidelines  on  personal  data  breach  notification  under
Regulation 2016/679 (“WP250”)212, which were endorsed by the EDPB, state that the "focus of any
breach response plan should be on protecting individuals and their personal data. Consequently, breach
notification should be seen as a tool enhancing compliance in relation to the protection of personal
data"213.

190. According to the Guidelines on personal data breach notification, a controller should be regarded as
having become “aware” when that controller has a reasonable degree of certainty that a security
incident has occurred that has led to personal data being compromised214. Since the controller uses
the processor to achieve its purposes, in principle, the controller should be considered as “aware” once

the processor has informed it of the breach215. However, the GDPR puts an obligation on the controller
to  ensure  that  they  will  be  “aware”  of  any  breaches  in  a  timely  manner  so  that  they  can  take
appropriate action"216 and explain that "the controller may undertake a short period of investigation in
order to establish whether or not a breach has in fact occurred. During this period of investigation the
controller may not be regarded as being “aware”"217. However, the Guidelines clarify that this initial
investigation  should  begin  as  soon  as  possible  and  that  a  more  detailed  investigation  can then
follow218.

191. The Guidelines thus make it clear that the controller, and by extension, the processor, are to act swiftly.
"In most cases these preliminary actions should be completed soon after the initial alert (i.e. when the
controller or processor suspects there has been a security incident which may involve personal data) –
it should take longer than this only in exceptional cases"219.

192. Having regard to the above, the EDPB agrees with the position of the IE SA’s assessment according to
which the controller cannot be expected to have become aware at the moment its processor has
realised that a security incident has occurred. As provided in the WP29 Guidelines on data breach
notifications,  which  were  endorsed  by  the  EDPB,  there  needs  to  be  a  degree  of  certainty  that  a
personal data breach has occurred before awareness can be stipulated. It is not clear from the facts at
issue as reflected in the Draft Decision that this was the case before the 3 January 2019. In this case,
AT SA did not prove that TIC reached the necessary degree of certainty as to the fact that a data breach
had occurred earlier than when the IE SA found TIC to be “aware” of the breach. As a consequence,
the EDPB considers that the assessment of the gravity of the infringement does not need to be adjusted
in light of a different determination of when the controller became aware of the data breach.

193. Moreover, as regards the gravity of the infringement, the EDPB agrees with IE SA that the compliance
with  Articles  33(1)  and  33(5)  GDPR  are  central  to  the  overall  functioning  of  the  supervision  and
enforcement regime.

194. As regards the objection raised by the AT SA regarding the intentional nature of the infringement, the
EDPB considers  that the  objection  did  not  sufficiently  demonstrate  that  from  the  moment  the
controller gained knowledge it intentionally disregarded its duty of care.

195. However, as regards the negligent nature of the infringement, the EDPB considers that a company for
whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities should have in place
sufficient procedures for the documentation of personal data breaches, including remedial actions,
which will enable it to also comply with the duty of notification under Article 33(1) GDPR. This element
implies  an  additional  element  to  take  into  consideration  in  the  analysis  of  the  gravity  of  the
infringement.

196. The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is one that has a genuine
deterrent  effect220.  In  that  respect,  a  distinction  can  be  made  between  general  deterrence
(discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific deterrence

(discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again)221. Moreover,
the severity of penalties must be commensurate with the seriousness of the infringements for which
they are imposed222. It follows that fines must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued, that is to
say, to compliance with the data protection rules and that the amount of the fine imposed on an
undertaking must be proportionate to the infringement viewed as a whole, account being taken in
particular of the gravity of the infringement223.

197. While the LSA in its Draft Decision made reference to the requirement that the file must be dissuasive
and proportionate, the EDPB considers that the LSA did not sufficiently substantiate how the fine
proposed  addresses these requirements. In  particular,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  LSA  moves  from
calculating the maximum amount of the fine (set at $60 million) to stating the proposed fining range
(set between $150.000,- and $300.000,-), without further explanation as to which particular elements
led the LSA to identify this specific range224. Beyond the general reference to the relevant factors of
Article 83 (2) GDPR, there is not a clear motivation for the choice of the proposed percentage (between
0.25% and 0.5%) of the maximum applicable fine under Article 83(4) GDPR.

198. In this regards, the EDPB has elaborated above the reasons to why the LSA in its Draft Decision should
have given greater weight to the element relating to the nature, scope and negligent character of the
infringement and therefore consider that the proposed fine range should be adjusted accordingly.

8.4.3 Conclusion

199. Following this, the EDPB considers that the fine proposed in the Draft Decision is too low and therefore
does not fulfil its purpose as a corrective measure, in particular it does not meet the requirements of
Article 83(1) GDPR of being effective, dissuasive and proportionate.

200. Thus, the EDPB requests the IE SA to re-assess the elements it relies upon to calculate the amount of

the fixed fine225 to be imposed on TIC so as to ensure it is appropriate to the facts of the case.

201. The EDPB notes that the analysis of the objections is limited to the substance of the objections to be
considered as relevant and reasoned. The scope of the EDPB’s analysis concerning the calculation of
the fine is therefore limited to an analysis of the method of the calculation of the fines as such. It does
not constitute an implicit or explicit validation by the EDPB, of the analysis carried out by the LSA
regarding the infringement of Article 33(1) or Article 33(5) GDPR or the legal qualification of the Twitter
Inc. and TIC respectively. The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any
assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties,
taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

9 BINDING DECISION

202. In light of the above and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue
binding  decisions  pursuant  to  Article 65 GDPR,  the  Board issues the  following  binding  decision  in
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR:

221 See inter alia Judgment of 13 June 2013, Versalis Spa / Commission, C-511/11, ECLI:EU:C:2013:386, para. 94.

224 Draft Decision 15.19 and 15.20.
225 This should preferably already be provided in the Art 60 GDPR draft decision.

Adopted

203. On the objections concerning the qualification of controller and processor and the competence of the

LSA:



The EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the
objections raised, as they do not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

204. On the objections concerning the infringements of Article 33(1) and 33(5) GDPR found by the LSA:



In relation to the objection of the FR SA on the absence of an infringement of Article 33(1) GDPR,
the objection of the DE SA on the determination of the dies a quo for the infringement of Article
33(1) GDPR, and the objection of the IT SA relating to the infringement of Article 33(5) GDPR, the
EDPB decides  that  the  IE  SA  is  not  required  to  amend  its  Draft  Decision  on  the  basis  of  the
objections raised as they do not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

205. On the objections relating to the possible further (or alternative) infringements of the GDPR identified

by the CSAs:





In relation to the objection of the DE SA on the possible infringements of Article 5(1)(f), Article 24,
and Article 32 GDPR, and to the objection of the IT SA on the possible infringement of Article 5(2)
GDPR, the EDPB decides that, while they meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the IE SA
is not required to amend its Draft Decision because the available factual elements included in the
Draft Decision and in the objections are not sufficient to allow the EDPB to establish the existence
of infringements of Articles 5(1)(f), Article 5(2), Article 24, and Article 32 GDPR.

In relation to the objection of the DE SA relating to the possible infringement of Article 33(3)
GDPR, the objection of the FR SA relating to the possible infringement of Article 28 and Article 32
GDPR, the objection of the HU SA relating to the possible infringement of Article 5(1)(f), Article
32, and Article 34 GDPR, and the objection of the IT SA relating to the possible infringement of
Article 28 GDPR, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on
the basis of the objections raised as they do not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

206. On the objection concerning the decision of the LSA to not issue a reprimand:



In  relation  to  the  objection  of  the DE  SA  concerning  the  decision  of the  IE  SA  not  to  issue a
reprimand, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the
basis of the objection raised as it does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

207. On the objection concerning the calculation of the fine suggested by the LSA:





In relation to the objection of the HU on the insufficiently dissuasive nature of the fine, the EDPB
decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the objection
raised as it does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.

In relation to the objection of the AT SA, the objection of the DE SA, and the objection of the IT
SA on the  insufficiently  dissuasive nature  of  the  fine,  the  EDPB  decides  that  they meet  the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and that the IE SA is required to re-assess the elements it
relies upon to calculate the amount of the fixed fine to be imposed on TIC, and to amend its Draft
Decision by increasing the level of the fine in order to ensure it fulfils its purpose as a corrective
measure and  meets the  requirements  of effectiveness,  dissuasiveness  and  proportionality
established by Article 83(1) GDPR and taking into account the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR.
