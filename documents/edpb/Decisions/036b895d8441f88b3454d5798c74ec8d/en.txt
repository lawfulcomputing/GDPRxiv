The European Data Protection Board 
Having regard to Article 66 of Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data 
and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection 
Regulation) (hereinafter ‘GDPR’)1, 
Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended 
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20182, 
Having regard to Articles 11, 13, 23 and 39 of the EDPB Rules of Procedure3, hereinafter the ‘EDPB 
RoP’. 

Whereas: 

(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the ‘EDPB’ or the ‘Board’) is to 
ensure the consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it can adopt opinions 
and binding decisions under different circumstances described under Articles 63 to 66 GDPR, within 
the consistency mechanism. The GDPR also established a cooperation mechanism, as it follows from 
Article 60 GDPR that the lead supervisory authority (hereinafter ‘LSA’) shall cooperate with the other 
supervisory authorities concerned (hereinafter ‘CSAs’) in an endeavour to reach consensus. 
(2) Pursuant to Article 66(1) GDPR, in exceptional circumstances, where a supervisory authority (‘SA’) 
considers that there  is an urgent  need to act in order to protect  the rights  and freedoms of data 
subjects, it may, by way of derogation from the consistency mechanism referred to in Articles 63, 64 
and 65 GDPR or the procedure referred to in Article 60 GDPR, immediately adopt provisional measures 
intended to produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity which shall not 
exceed three months.  

(3) In accordance with Article 66(2) GDPR, where a supervisory authority has taken a measure pursuant 
to Article 66(1) GDPR and considers that final measures need urgently be adopted, it may request an 
urgent  opinion  or  an  urgent  binding  decision  from  the  Board,  giving  reasons  for  requesting  such 
opinion or decision.  

(4) In accordance with Article 13(2) EDPB RoP, the supervisory authority requesting an urgent binding 
decision  shall  submit  any  relevant  document.  When  necessary,  the  documents  submitted  by  the 
competent supervisory authority shall be translated into English by the EDPB Secretariat. Once the 
Chair  and  the  competent  supervisory  authority  have  decided  that  the  file  is  complete,  it  is 
communicated via the EDPB Secretariat to the members of the Board without undue delay. 

(5) Pursuant to Article 66(4) GDPR and Article 13(1) EDPB RoP, the urgent binding decision of the EDPB 
shall be adopted by simple majority of the members of the EDPB within two weeks following the 
decision by the Chair and the competent supervisory authority that the file is complete.

1  SUMMARY OF FACTS

4. 

This document contains an urgent binding decision adopted by the EDPB pursuant to Article 66(2) 
GDPR, following a request made by the Norwegian supervisory authority - ‘Datatilsynet’ (hereinafter, 
the ‘NO SA’) within the framework of the urgency procedure under Article 66 GDPR. 

1.1  Summary of the relevant events  
On 31 December 2022, the Irish supervisory authority (‘Data Protection Commission’, hereinafter the 
‘IE SA’) issued a final decision concerning the inquiry IN-18-5-5 (hereinafter, the ‘IE SA FB Decision’, 
related to the Facebook Service) and a final decision concerning the inquiry IN-18-5-7 (hereinafter, the 
‘IE SA IG Decision’, related to the Instagram Service) in which it found that Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd 
(hereinafter, ‘Meta IE’) did not rely on a valid legal basis for processing personal data for behavioural 
advertising  purposes4.  These  two  decisions  (hereinafter,  collectively,  the  ‘IE  SA  Decisions’)  were 
adopted on the basis of EDPB Binding Decisions 3/2022 and 4/2022, adopted by the EDPB pursuant to 
Article 65(1) (a) GDPR on 5 December 2022 (hereinafter, the ‘EDPB Binding Decisions’)5.  
Each of the IE SA Decisions concluded that Meta IE was not entitled to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to 
carry out processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the 
Facebook Terms of Service / Instagram Terms of Use6 and included an order, addressed to Meta IE, to 
bring its processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes into compliance with Article 
6(1) GDPR within three months7.  

On  5  April  2023,  the  IE  SA  shared  with  the  CSAs8,  using  the  Internal  Market  Information  system 
(hereinafter, ‘IMI’)9, Meta IE’s compliance reports regarding the Facebook Service (IN-18-5-5) and the 
Instagram  Service  (IN-18-5-7)  (hereinafter  collectively,  the  ‘Meta  IE  Compliance  Reports’  or  the 
‘Compliance Reports’)10 and supporting material that Meta IE submitted to the IE SA on 3 April 2023 

                                                            
4 Decision of the Irish Data Protection Commission of 31 December 2022, DPC Inquiry Reference: IN-18-5-5, 
concerning a complaint directed against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook Ireland Limited) in 
respect of the Facebook Service (the ‘IE SA FB Decision’); Decision of the Irish Data Protection Commission of 31 
December  2022,  DPC  Inquiry  Reference:  IN-18-5-7,  concerning  a  complaint  directed  against  Meta  Platforms 
Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook Ireland Limited) in respect of the Instagram Service (the ‘IE SA IG Decision’).   
5 EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022, adopted on 05 December 2022 (hereinafter ‘EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022’); 
EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022 adopted on 05 December 2022 (hereinafter ‘EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022’). In 
each of these binding decisions the EDPB instructed the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which 
concluded that Meta IE may rely on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of 
Service  or  the  Instagram  Terms  of  Use  and  to  include  an  infringement  of  Art.  6(1)  GDPR  based  on  the 
shortcomings that the EDPB has identified in the EDPB Binding Decisions. The reasoning of the EDPB is available 
in paragraphs 94-133 and 484 of EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022 and in paragraphs 97-137 and 451 of EDPB 
Binding Decision 4/2022.  
6 IE SA FB Decision, Finding 2, p. 49; IE SA IG Decision, Finding 2, p. 49.  
7 IE SA FB Decision, paragraphs 8.8, 10.44; IE SA IG Decision, paragraphs 212, 417. The deadline for compliance 
with the orders in the IE SA Decisions fell on 5 April 2023.  
8 In the cases leading to the adoption of the IE SA Decisions, all EEA SAs were CSAs pursuant to the GDPR (IE SA 
FB Decision, Schedule 1, paragraph 1.10; IE SA IG Decision, Appendix 1 - Schedule 1, paragraph 6).  
9 More specifically, the IE SA shared on 5 April 2023 the Meta IE Compliance Reports via two IMI workflows, one 
for the IE SA FB Decision and one for the IE SA IG Decision respectively (hereinafter, collectively, the ‘IE SA IMI 
Informal Consultations’ or the ‘IMI Informal Consultations’).  
10 Meta IE’s Compliance Report regarding the Facebook Service (IN-18-5-5) of 3 April 2023 (hereinafter, ‘Meta 
IE Compliance Report on IE SA FB Decision’), paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 and Meta IE’s Compliance Report 

Adopted

with  the  aim  of  showing  compliance  with  the  IE  SA  Decisions.  In  its  Compliance  Reports,  Meta  IE 
indicated  that  it  changed  its  legal  basis  for  the  majority11  of  its  processing  of  personal  data  for 
behavioural advertising purposes from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as of 5 April 2023, 
which was the deadline for compliance with the IE SA Decisions12. Specifically for reliance on Article 
6(1)(f) GDPR, Meta IE provided legitimate interests assessments as supporting materials13 (hereinafter 
collectively, the ‘Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments’). Without providing its own analysis on 
the Compliance Reports, the IE SA invited all the CSAs to assess the extent to which the measures 
implemented by Meta IE achieved compliance with the orders in the IE SA Decisions and welcomed 
feedback from the CSAs by 5 May 2023. The deadline was later on extended to 15 May 202314. 

On the same day, the NO SA emailed the IE SA in respect of Meta IE’s change of legal basis to legitimate 
interest, expressing strong doubts as to whether this legal basis could be validly relied on and asking 
for the IE SA’s preliminary view on this.  

On 6 April 2023, upon request of the IE SA, the EDPB Secretariat circulated a message from the IE SA 
to the members of the Enforcement expert subgroup within the EDPB. Such message aimed to attract 
all CSAs’ attention to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations circulated by the IE SA via IMI15. On the same 
day, the IE SA replied to the NO SA’s email of 5 April 2023, pointing to the message from the IE SA to 
the CSAs circulated by the EDPB Secretariat.  

On 13 April 2023, the IE SA shared with the CSAs via IMI two further letters from Meta IE (one on the 
IE SA FB Decision and one on the IE SA IG Decision) dated 12 April 2023, providing further information 
on its compliance efforts in relation to the IE SA Decisions.  

On 14 April 2023, the NO SA responded negatively to a meeting request from Meta IE dated 28 March 
2023, pointing out that the case is handled by the IE SA as the LSA.  

Some CSAs asked for clarifications on the procedure being followed, for example on the reasons why 
the IE SA did not at that point share its assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the orders in the IE 
SA Decisions. The IE SA clarified, first, that the assessment of compliance with the orders in the IE SA 
Decisions would be carried out on a joint basis, more specifically by way of an assessment carried out 
by the CSAs at the same time as the LSA, and that this sequencing of the process was aimed to ensure 
a timely and consistent approach, in line with the deadline for compliance determined by the EDPB,

regarding the Instagram Service (IN-18-5-7) of 3 April 2023 (hereinafter, ‘Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA 
IG Decision’), paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3. 
11 According to the Compliance Reports, Meta IE continued to process limited categories of non-behavioural 
information to show advertising on Facebook or Instagram based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. See Meta IE Compliance 
Report on IE SA FB Decision, paragraphs 3.1.3 and 5.8.2, and Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA IG Decision, 
paragraphs 3.1.3 and 5.8.2.

13 Meta IE’s Legitimate Interests Assessments Behavioural Advertising Processing of 3 April 2023, Annex 4 to 
Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA FB Decision and Annex 4 to Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA IG Decision. 
14 Following requests from two of the CSAs, the deadline to share feedback was extended until 15 May 2023. In 
fact, the IE SA waited for a few more days, giving the opportunity to further CSAs to share their views.  
15 In the same message, the IE SA also specified: ‘As you will also recall, IE SA confirmed, during the Article 65 
[GDPR] discussions, that any assessment of compliance with the orders made [in the IE SA Decisions] would be 
carried out on a joint basis, the same as in previous cases, whereby the IE SA together with all CSAs would jointly 
assess the extent to which any action taken has achieved compliance with the terms of the order’.

formulated  on  the  basis  that  urgent  action  was  required  to  be  taken  by  Meta  IE  to  address  the 
infringement16. The IE SA also clarified that it would not issue a new draft decision17. 

10. 

Several CSAs provided their feedback on the way in which Meta IE complied with the IE SA Decisions.  

•  The Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde (Austrian supervisory authority - hereinafter, the ‘AT 
SA’)  shared  its  views  that  processing  operations  in  connection  with  behavioural  advertising 
could not be based on Article 6(1) (f) GDPR18.  

•  The  Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten  (Swedish  supervisory  authority  -  hereinafter,  the  ‘SE  SA’) 

stressed the importance of adhering to any applicable EDPB guidelines19.  

•  The Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (hereinafter, the ‘DE 
Hamburg SA’) shared its views stating that ‘at this stage, consent would be the only possible 
legal basis to comply with’ the orders in the IE SA Decisions, and expressing concerns regarding 
the indications that sensitive data are processed without consent and regarding the processing 
activities for which Meta IE continued to rely upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR20.  

•  The Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (Dutch supervisory authority - hereinafter the ‘NL SA’) shared 
its views that ‘the interests listed by [Meta IE] in the/its Legitimate Interest Assessment cannot 
be considered as “legitimate interests” in the sense of Article 6(1) (f) GDPR’, the processing of 
personal data is not ‘necessary’ for the purpose of the declared interests, and the ‘fundamental 
rights and freedoms of the data subject override the interest of [Meta IE] and the third parties 
involved’21. 

•  The NO SA transmitted on 5 May 2023 a formal mutual assistance request under Article 61 (1) 
GDPR22 (hereinafter, the ‘NO SA Mutual Assistance Request’) to the LSA using the dedicated 

                                                            
16 These clarifications were made by the IE SA on 26 April 2023 as a reply to a question of the FR SA of 25 April 
2023 made in the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations.  
17  The  SE  SA  asked  for  clarification  on  the  procedure  being  followed  on  4  May  2023  via  the  IMI  Informal 
Consultations. The IE SA replied on 5 May 2023.  
18 These views were shared as a reply to the IE SA IMI informal consultation concerning only the IE SA FB Decision 
(Comment of the AT SA of 18 April 2023), see footnote 9. The AT SA also indicated that a balancing test was also 
difficult because the term ‘Behavioural Advertising Processing’ was not defined in the Privacy Policy and what 
this actually entailed was not entirely clear. The AT SA also made reference to the reasoning in its relevant and 
reasoned objection to the IE SA’s draft decision in the procedure leading to the adoption of the IE SA FB Decision.  
19 Comment of the SE SA of 4 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, see footnote 9. 
20 Comment of the DE Hamburg SA of 4 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, see footnote 
9. In its comments, the DE Hamburg SA stated that there ‘are strong indications that sensitive data stemming 
from different sources are processed without consent against the Art. 9 (1) GDPR’ and that ‘consent [is] the only 
possible legal basis for that kind of processing’ and made further remarks on this issue. The DE Hamburg SA also 
stated that the ‘processing described or indicated in the updated Terms of Use and [Meta IE] Privacy Notice 
cannot be based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR’.  
21 Comment of the NL SA of 4 May 2023, paragraph 3 - attached as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, 
see footnote 9. The NL SA, in its comments, also ‘urgently asks the [IE SA] to swiftly undertake adequate actions 
in  order  to  cease  the  continuous  illegality  of  the  invasive  processing  of  personal  data  of  millions  of  users’  
(paragraph 4). In addition to providing detailed views on the applicability of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (paragraphs 8-63), 
the NL SA also stressed its concerns about the processing of special categories of data and about the compatibility 
of the processing of the amount of data at stake with the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation 
(paragraphs 6-7).  
22 Comment of the NO SA of 5 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations (see footnote 9), 
attaching a copy of the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request introduced on 5 May 2023.

IMI flow23. The NO SA requested the IE SA to (1) issue a temporary ban on Meta IE’s processing 
of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and (2) share 
a timeline with the NO SA and the CSAs specifying how the IE SA will ensure in an expedient 
manner that Meta IE complies with Article 6(1) GDPR.  

•  The Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (Spanish supervisory authority - hereinafter the 
‘ES SA’) shared its views stating that ‘the submitted Legitimate Interest Assessment does not 
demonstrate  that  the  processing  carried  out  by  [Meta  IE]  with  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertisement be based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR since it does not meet the requirements of this 
Article’24. 

•  The  Tietosuojavaltuutetun  toimisto  (Finnish  supervisory  authority  -  hereinafter  the  ‘FI  SA’) 
shared its views on 15 May 2023 that ‘based on the information available, it does not seem that 
[Meta IE] would have brought all its processing activities into compliance with the GDPR and 
would meet the requirements of the GDPR’25.  

• 

In  addition,  the  Garante  per  la  protezione  dei  dati  personali  (Italian  supervisory  authority  - 
hereinafter, the ‘IT SA’) shared its views on 23 May 2023 saying that ‘[Meta IE’s] proposal is not 
such as to adequately implement the order to bring the processing into compliance insofar as it 
misclassifies  part  of  the  user-related  information  and  thereby  applies  the  legal  basis  of 

                                                            
23 The formal NO SA Mutual Assistance Request contained two requests labelled as follows: ‘Pursuant to Art. 
61(1) GDPR, the following requests are made: i. We kindly request that the IE SA issues a temporary ban on [Meta 
IE]’s processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes on Facebook and Instagram based on Art. 
6(1)(f) GDPR, in accordance with Art. 58(2)(f) GDPR. The ban should last until the lead and concerned supervisory 
authorities are satisfied that [Meta IE] has provided adequate and sufficient commitments to ensure compliance 
with Art. 6(1) GDPR and Art. 21 GDPR, in line with Art. 31 GDPR. This will give us the opportunity to further engage 
with [Meta IE] and make sure that it commits to fully respect its obligations under the GDPR, while preventing 
any further risks for data subjects stemming from [Meta IE]’s non-compliant behavioural advertising practices. 
Please note that in our view, behavioural advertising includes any activities where advertising is targeted on the 
basis of a data subject’s behaviour or movements, including advertising based on perceived location’. ii. ‘We 
kindly request that the IE SA shares a timeline specifying how it will ensure in an expedient manner that [Meta IE] 
complies with Art. 6(1) GDPR. We should be grateful if the IE SA, by 5 June 2023, would share the timeline and 
confirm that a temporary ban will be issued. If the IE SA is not in a position to comply with our request regarding 
[Meta IE], we may need to consider our options in relation to the adoption of provisional measures in Norway 
pursuant to Art. 66 GDPR. We hope that this will not be necessary and look forward to cooperating further with 
the IE SA within the framework of the cooperation mechanisms set out in Chapter VII GDPR’. 
24 These views were shared as a reply in the IE SA IMI informal consultation concerning only the IE SA IG Decision 
(Comment of the ES SA of 12 May 2023). More specifically, the ES SA argued that the interests listed by Meta IE 
are ‘purely economic or commercial interests’ of Meta IE or third parties, and that in respect of the condition of 
necessity  of  the  processing  ‘the  direct  link  between  the  processing  and  the  legitimate  interest  should  be 
established and prove that there are no less intrusive alternatives for the data subjects that could serve the 
interest equally effectively’ (p. 4). The ES SA also noted some shortcomings in the balancing test carried out by 
Meta IE (Comment of the ES SA of 12 May 2023, p. 5).  
25 Comment of the FI SA of 15 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations (see footnote 9). More 
specifically, the FI SA expressed doubts about legitimate interest being the most suitable legal basis in the case 
at hand and argued that the Legitimate Interests Assessment carried out by Meta IE ‘seems to be rather one-
sided and superficial and fails to convince why the interests of [Meta IE] or third parties should override the 
interests and fundamental rights of the data subjects’ (Comment of the FI SA of 15 May 2023, p. 2) and ‘fails to 
take duly into consideration the volume of the processing and the high number of users of the said services’ 
(Comment of the FI SA of 15 May 2023, p. 2-3). The FI SA also noted that certain categories of personal data seem 
to still be unlawfully collected for behavioural advertising purposes under Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (Comment of the FI 
SA of 15 May 2023, p. 2).

contractual performance under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to the serving of ads which, actually, are 
behavioural in nature’26; the IT SA also highlighted some concerns concerning the switch  to 
legitimate interest for the other processing activities for behavioural advertising purposes27.  

11. 

The IE SA shared with Meta IE the feedback received from the CSAs and invited Meta IE to provide 
submissions on these views by 2 June 202328.  

12.  On 30 May 2023, the NL SA sent the IE SA a request for mutual assistance under Article 61 GDPR 
(hereinafter, the ‘NL SA Mutual Assistance Request’) asking the IE SA to provide its conclusion as to 
whether Meta IE could rely on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, its conclusion as to whether Meta IE complies 
with the IE SA Decisions and as to a timeframe, which appropriate and expedient action will be taken 
to ensure that Meta IE acts in compliance with Article 6 GDPR29. 

13.  On 31 May 2023, the IE SA provided an update to all CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations 
(hereinafter, the ‘IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023’, informing them about the NL SA Mutual 
Assistance Request and highlighting that it will be in a position to complete its own assessment of the 
Meta IE Compliance Reports and share its assessment with the NO SA and NL SA (who lodged Article 
61 GDPR requests) and all other CSAs by the end of June 2023. In particular, the IE SA indicated that 
they had ‘received all of the assessments from CSAs’ and ‘forwarded them to [Meta IE] for it to consider 
the  views  expressed  and  to  detail  any  changes  that  it  proposes  to  implement  on  foot  of  the  CSA 
assessments’. Furthermore, the IE SA stated that it will ‘complete its own assessment of [Meta IE]’s 
compliance reports’ after receiving Meta IE’s response. The IE SA also stated ‘it will be in a position to 
complete its own assessment of [Meta IE]’s compliance reports and to share its assessment with the 
Norwegian  and  Dutch  supervisory  authorities  (both  of  which  have  lodged  Article  61  requests  for 
mutual assistance) and with all other CSAs by the end of June 2023’.  

14.  Also, on 31 May 2023, Meta IE sent a letter to the IE SA providing its views and comments on the 
process that was being followed by the IE SA and asking for an extension of its deadline to provide a 
reply. In this context, it also provided some comments to the IE SA on the CSAs' feedback and some 
preliminary comments on the requests for urgent enforcement action from some CSAs. 

                                                            
26 Comment of the IT SA of 23 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations (see footnote 9). As 
indicated in footnote 11, Meta IE indicated in its Compliance Reports the fact that it continued to process some 
data  under  Art.  6(1)(b)  GDPR.  The  IT  SA  argued  in  this  respect  that  ‘[Meta  IE]’s  distinction  between  non-
behavioural and behavioural advertising can be said to be artificial and based merely on language’ (Comment of 
the IT SA of 23 May 2023, p. 1) 
27 Comment of the IT SA of 23 May 2023 as a reply to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations (see footnote 9). More 
specifically, according to the IT SA, ‘it is as if the controller was shifting the burden of proof regarding legitimate 
interest as the legal basis of processing on the data subjects – who conversely should be called into play as key 
actors  in  the  two  subsequent  steps  of  the  legitimate  interest  test,  i.e.  when  assessing  the  necessity  of  the 
processing and performing the required balancing exercise’ (Comment of the IT SA of 23 May 2023, p. 2). The IT 
SA also underlined that ‘the processing operations underpinning the use of Online Behavioural Advertising should 
more appropriately be grounded in consent as a legal basis within the meaning of Art. 6(1) (a) GDPR’ (p.3). 
28 On 12 May 2023 and 16 May 2023, the IE SA sent two letters to Meta IE, providing Meta IE with the first replies 
received from CSAs informing Meta IE that some CSAs requested an extension of time to provide a response. On 
25 May 2023, the IE SA transmitted to Meta IE the latest comments from CSAs with respect to the way in which 
Meta IE complied with the IE SA Decisions. The IE SA invited Meta IE to provide submissions by 2 June COB. On 
26 May 2023, the IE SA shared an update with all CSAs, informing them that their responses were forwarded to 
Meta IE, whose response was awaited by 2 June 2023.  
29 The IE SA provided a reply on 31 May 2023. On the same day, the IE SA provided an update to CSAs in the IMI 
Informal Consultations, described in the following paragraph.

15.  On 2 June 2023, the IE SA provided a reply to the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request. In the notification 
form used, the IE SA stated that it could not comply with the request (by checking a pre-code text box), 
and invited the NO SA to look at the ‘detailed response uploaded by the [IE SA]’ in the IE SA IMI Informal 
Consultations (see above, paragraph 13). 

16.  On 9 June 2023, the NO SA further replied to the IE SA, via the IE SA IMI flow relating to the NO SA 
Mutual Assistance Request, asking whether the IE SA could ‘share their preliminary thoughts or non-
bindingly indicate whether [it] may potentially be inclined to follow [the NO SA Mutual Assistance 
Request]’. In the same message the NO SA indicated that it would in any case await the IE SA’s response 
towards the end of June. 

17.  On 13 June 2023, the IE SA informed all CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations that it would 
await the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-252/21 (Meta Platforms 
Inc.  v  Bundeskartellamt)  (hereinafter,  the  ‘CJEU  Bundeskartellamt  Judgment’)  before  sharing  its 
assessment  of  the  Meta  IE  Compliance  Reports30.  The  IE  SA,  noting  the  NO  SA  Mutual  Assistance 
Request  and  the  NL  SA  Mutual  Assistance  Request,  indicated  their  intention  to  finalise  their 
assessment as soon as possible after the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment expected on 4 July 2023. 

18.  On 14 June 2023, the IE SA sent a letter to Meta IE replying to its letter of 31 May 2023. The IE SA 
explained  its  intention  to  wait  for  the  CJEU  Bundeskartellamt  Judgment  before  circulating  its 
provisional assessment of the steps taken by Meta IE in purported compliance with the orders in the 
IE SA Decisions, as well as the expected next steps leading to the issuance of the final outcome of the 
assessment of compliance. In the same letter, the IE SA informed Meta IE that it no longer required it 
to make submissions in reply to the CSAs’ initial observations. 

19.  On 21 June 2023, Meta IE shared with the IE SA its views on the concerns raised by some of the CSAs 
and regarding potential urgent proceedings. On 23 June 2023, the IE SA shared via the IMI Informal 
Consultations the communication received from Meta IE on 21 June 2023. The IE SA stated that Meta 
IE  specified  that  this  communication  is  without  prejudice  to  Meta  IE’s  position  that  it  brought  its 
processing into compliance with the orders in the IE SA Decisions.  

20.  On 30 June 2023, Meta IE shared by letter additional information with the IE SA regarding the IE SA’s 
proposed compliance assessment. In this letter, Meta IE outlined its views on the next steps envisaged 
by the IE SA and provided information and arguments on what it considered to be misunderstandings 
underpinning the views provided by the CSAs on the Meta IE Compliance Reports31.  

21.  On  4  July  2023,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  delivered  the  CJEU  Bundeskartellamt 
Judgment32. On 6 July 2023, the IE SA indicated to all the CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations 
                                                            
30 The CJEU had just announced that it would deliver the judgment before the IE SA gave this update to the CSAs. 
31 Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 30 June 2023. Meta IE’s comments on the next steps envisaged by the IE SA 
are available in paragraphs 1-3 of this letter. Meta IE also provided clarifications, information and arguments on 
what  it  considered  to  be  misunderstandings  underpinning  the  views  provided  by  the  CSAs  on  the  Meta  IE 
Compliance Reports in paragraph 7. By way of example, Meta IE stated that it ‘does not engage in a “balancing” 
exercise  on  receipt  of  a  valid  objection’,  that  the  IE  SA  Decisions  only  apply  to  processing  for  behavioural 
advertising purposes (and not to processing of non-behavioural information for advertising purposes), and that 
the assessment of ‘Behavioural Advertising Processing’ only concerns data relating to activity on Facebook and 
Instagram (on-platform data). Meta IE also clarified that it relies on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR to process information 
provided  to  Meta  IE  by  third  party  advertising  partners  (‘off-platform  data‘)  for  the  purposes  of  showing 
personalised advertisements.

that it was considering such judgment in the context of finalising its provisional assessment of the steps 
taken by Meta IE in purported compliance with the IE SA Decisions33.  

22.  On 11 July 2023, the IE SA issued a provisional position paper (‘IE SA Provisional Position Paper’) in 
which it preliminarily concluded that Meta IE had not complied with the orders in the IE SA Decisions, 
and shared it with the CSAs alongside a letter dated 30 June 2023 received from Meta IE34. The IE SA 
invited the CSAs to share their views on the IE SA Provisional Position Paper by 21 July 202335.  

23.  Between 20 July 2023 and 21 July 2023, two CSAs shared their views on the IE SA Provisional Position 
Paper via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations36. The IE SA shared these CSAs’ views with Meta IE on 
21 July 2023. 

24.  On 14 July 2023, the NO SA imposed a temporary ban on Meta IE and Facebook Norway AS (‘Facebook 
Norway’)  regarding  the  processing  of  personal  data  of  data  subjects  in  Norway  for  behavioural 
advertising for which Meta IE relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (the ‘NO SA Order’ 
or  the  ‘Provisional  Measures’).  On  the  same  day,  the  NO  SA  informed  by  email  the  IE  SA  of  the 
Provisional Measures being taken on the basis of Article 66(1) GDPR. On 7 August 2023, the NO SA 
rejected Meta IE’s and Facebook Norway’s request for deferred implementation of the NO SA Order.  

25.  On 20 July 2023, the IE SA shared an update to the CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, 
informing the CSAs of its views on the NO SA Order. It also stated that it did not mean to refuse to 
comply  with  the  NO  SA  Mutual  Assistance  Request  as  this  was  a  result  of  ‘incorrectly  (and 
inadvertently)’ checking a box and that, in its view, its communication to the NO SA of 2 June 2023 was 
referring to two documents shared with all CSAs on 31 May 202337, which ‘directed to the subject 
matter of the NO SA [Mutual Assistance Request]’ and were ‘clearly engaging with the substance of 
the NO SA [Mutual Assistance Request] [...]’.  

26.  On 24 July 2023, the NO SA answered to questions from a politician in the Irish national parliament on 
the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request. In its reply, the NO SA describes the reply provided by the IE SA 
to  the  NO  SA  Mutual  Assistance  Request  and  explains  the  reasons  behind  the  issuance  of  the 
Provisional Measures, expressing its concerns that ‘while it is very clear that [Meta IE] does not comply 
with the GDPR, failing to take specific and resolute enforcement action would lead to a cat-and-mouse 
game whereby [Meta IE] is able to evade compliance indefinitely’ and that ‘simply stating that [Meta 
IE] does not comply with the GDPR [...] without imposing any specific order spelling out what [Meta 
IE] must potentially do to comply with the law and by which date, will allow [Meta IE] to further delay 
compliance’. 

                                                            
33  In  the  same  communication,  the  IE  SA  also  indicated  they  expected  to  be  in  a  position  to  circulate  their 
provisional assessment the following week, and that they would then give the CSAs a period of ten days to 
respond. While the NO SA and the IE SA indicated that this update occurred on 5 July 2023, according to the IMI 
reports relating to the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, this update seems to have been sent on 6 July 2023.  
34 This letter was already mentioned above in paragraph 20. 
This update was shared by the IE SA via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations. Together with the IE SA Provisional 
Position Paper and the Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 30 June 2023, the IE SA also shared again the Meta IE 
Compliance Reports (already shared on 5 April 2023 with the CSAs).  
35 In the same communication, the IE SA also indicated that it would then provide the CSAs’ views on the IE SA 
Provisional Position Paper to Meta IE inviting it to make its submissions by 4 August 2023.  
36 The NL SA shared its views via a document attached on 20 July 2023 and the DE Hamburg SA via a document 
attached on 21 July 2023.

27.  On 27 July 2023, Meta IE sent a letter to the IE SA stating that it intends to ground its processing for 
behavioural advertising purposes38 on consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) (by way of “Meta IE’s Consent 
Proposal”Meta IE’s Consent Proposal) 
 
 
39. The IE SA 

shared this letter with the CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations.  

28.  On the same day, Meta IE sent a letter to the NO SA, making reference to the letter sent to the IE SA 
and requesting the NO SA to lift the Provisional Measures in light of Meta IE’s commitments to the LSA 
to ensure compliance by way of relying upon consent. 

29.  On 1 August 2023, the IE SA replied to Meta IE taking note of Meta IE’s intention to implement the 
 

necessary measures to enable it to rely on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR 

40. 

30.  Meanwhile, on 1 August 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway lodged a complaint with the NO SA 
requesting that it lifts the NO SA Order. On 3 August 2023, the NO SA rejected this complaint and on 
the following day the NO SA sent a letter to Meta IE and Facebook Norway requesting confirmation as 
to whether the NO SA Order would be complied with.  

31.  On 4 August 2023, Meta IE provided its response to the IE SA Provisional Position Paper. On the same 
date, Meta IE and Facebook Norway replied to the NO SA that they have, in their view, complied with 
the NO SA Order, and requested the Oslo District Court to grant a preliminary injunction against the 
NO SA Order.  

32.  On 7 August 2023, the NO SA decided to impose a coercive fine on Meta IE and Facebook Norway for 
the  non-compliance  with  the  NO  SA  Order.  On  14  August  2023,  Meta  IE  requested  the  deferred 
implementation of the coercive fine imposed on Meta IE and Facebook Norway, at least until the Oslo 
District Court has ruled on Meta IE’s and Facebook Norway’s applications for a preliminary injunction. 
On  25  August  2023,  the  NO  SA  rejected  Meta  IE’s  and  Facebook  Norway’s  request  for  deferred 
implementation of the coercive fine.  

33.  On 8 August 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway sent a letter to the Ministry of Local Government 
and  Regional  Development  of  Norway,  asking  it  to  consider  Meta  IE’s  and  Facebook  Norway’s 
complaints against the NO SA Order submitted to the NO SA on 1 August 202341. The Ministry of Local

40 This letter was shared by the IE SA with the CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations. The IE SA also 
highlighted that all the correspondence from Meta IE should be treated as confidential.  
41 Meta IE sustained that the Ministry should have declared the complaint valid and the decision should have 
been repealed, indicating that ‘the audit did not give [Meta IE] necessary notice of its proposed actions and did 
not give [Meta IE] the necessary opportunity to be heard’. In addition, Facebook Norway was of the opinion that 
the NO SA wrongfully indicated Facebook Norway as an addressee of the decision.

Government  and  Regional  Development  of  Norway  responded  on  10  August  2023,  refusing  to 
accommodate  the  request  and  indicating  that  it  did  not  have  the  authority  to  handle  complaints 
against the NO SA Order. 

34.  On 10 August 2023, Meta IE sent a letter to the IE SA 

 
 
 highlighted its concerns arising from the Article 66 GDPR 
proceedings arising from the Provisional Measures and running in parallel to the process led by the IE 
SA.  

35. 

36. 

37. 

The IE SA responded on 11 August 2023. In its letter, the IE SA 

 
 
 
 
 highlighted that it considered it is not for it to second-guess the decision of the NO SA to 
trigger the application of the urgency procedure and that the Article 66 GDPR procedure would take 
its own course.  

The proceedings concerning the request for preliminary injunction lodged with the Oslo District Court 
further developed and the parties submitted written pleadings42.  

43.  

 
 
 

38.  On 18 August 2023, the IE SA shared with all CSAs its final position paper (‘IE SA Final Position Paper’), 
in which the IE SA concluded that Meta IE failed to demonstrate compliance with the orders in the IE 
SA Decisions44. The IE SA also indicated its view that in light of the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal, it is fair 
                                                            
42 On 10 August 2023 and 11 August 2023, respectively, Meta IE and Facebook Norway and the NO SA submitted 
their written pleadings to the Oslo District Court. Meta IE requested provisional injunctions to avoid damage 
following an alleged invalid administrative decision and Facebook Norway claimed that the NO SA’s justification 
was inadequate. The NO SA responded to the request for a preliminary injunction claiming, inter alia, that there 
was no case processing error that may have affected the content of the decision, the conditions for urgent 
measures for adopting its decision were met, the decision did not violate Article 84 GDPR (proportionality) and 
that  an  injunction  by  the  Oslo  District  Court  would  have  been  in  a  manifest  disparity  with  the  damages  or 
inconveniences Norway would have been inflicted. Meta IE then submitted further written pleadings to the Oslo 
District Court on 14 August 2023. On 15 August 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway complained against the NO 
SA about the NO SA’s rejection of their complaint. Meta IE and Facebook Norway reiterate that the appeal before 
the Ministry should be admissible and that they have the right to appeal the decision of the Ministry (contrary 
to the Ministry’s declaration) according to administrative law. On 16 August 2023, the NO SA submitted further 
written pleadings to the Oslo District Court, while Meta IE and Facebook Norway submitted their additional 
written pleadings on 18 August 2023.

44 Together with the IE SA Final Position Paper, the IE SA shared with the CSAs the same supporting materials as 
shared together with the IE SA Provisional Position Paper. See above paragraph 22. 
Also, on 17 August 2023, the IE SA provided an update to all CSAs via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations, 
informing them mainly of the fact that the copies of the relevant communications to which the IE SA was party 
were transmitted to the NO SA and Meta IE to ensure that both the NO SA and Meta IE were in a position to put 
the full suite of communications before the Oslo District Court.

and reasonable to give Meta IE an opportunity to demonstrate that it can rely on consent as its lawful 
basis rather than engaging in enforcement measures45.  

39.  On 25 August 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway submitted, each, to the NO SA their comments on 
the NO SA’s intended request for an urgent binding decision from the EDPB pursuant to Article 66 (2) 
GDPR, which was specified in the NO SA Order. 

40.  On  28  August  2023,  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  Norway  complained  against  the  NO  SA  regarding  the 
coercive  fine  it  had  imposed.  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  Norway  asked  the  NO  SA  to  revoke  the 
enforcement decision or, at least, to lower the amount.  

41.  On 6 September 2023, the Oslo District Court decided not to grant the petitions from Meta IE and 

Facebook Norway for a preliminary injunction against the NO SA Order.

44.  On 21 September 2023, the NO SA sent a letter to the IE SA outlining their views on the current state 
of play. More specifically, the NO SA stated that it considered there is still an urgent need for a ban of 
the  unlawful  processing  of  personal  data  carried  out  by  Meta  IE  despite  the  Meta  IE’s  Consent 
Proposal48, and that such a ban would 
 
represent an incentive for Meta IE to swiftly bring processing into compliance49. Thus, the NO SA asked 
the IE SA to reconsider their position, outlined in the IE SA Final Position Paper that enforcement

measures are not necessary at this point in time50. The letter also mentioned that the NO SA requested 
submissions from Meta IE about its intention to ask the EDPB for an urgent binding decision, but may 
consider not making such request should the IE SA decide to adopt enforcement measures51.  

45.  On 26 September 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway made submissions in relation to the request of 
the NO SA for an urgent binding decision of the EDPB and the NO SA lodged its request to the EDPB on 
IMI. Further details on this are available below52.  

46.  On 27 September 2023, the IE SA replied to the letter of the NO SA of 21 September 2023, outlining 
its views on the NO SA’s position and course of action. More specifically, the IE SA recalled that the 
EDPB explicitly declined to instruct the IE SA to impose a temporary ban in the EDPB Binding Decisions 
and explained that each of the IE SA Decisions ‘made provision for enforcement measures, namely, 
the  orders  for  compliance,  under  which  [Meta  IE]’s  proposals  for  the  adoption  of  one  or  more 
alternative legal bases for the [processing operations at stake] would be assessed, and ruled on, on 
their respective merits’53. The IE SA also expressed the view that ‘it is inaccurate to suggest that the [IE 
SA] could impose an immediate ban on processing, whilst continuing to progress its assessment of 
[Meta IE]’s proposed consent-based model, in conjunction with its CSA colleagues’54. 

47.  On 11 October 2023, the NO SA replied to the letter of the IE SA of 27 September 2023. In this letter, 
the NO SA expressed its concern that despite the LSA and CSAs ‘agreeing that [Meta IE] cannot base 
processing of personal data for behavioural advertising on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, 
[Meta IE] continues to violate Article 6(1) GDPR and the [IE SA Decisions], and such violation continues 
to be tolerated’55. The NO SA reiterated its view that ‘corrective measures can and should be imposed 
on [Meta IE] as soon as possible to stop [Meta IE]’s current illegal processing activities’56. 

48. 

The IE SA further replied on 13 October 2023. In its letter, the IE SA argued that the request of the NO 
SA to the EDPB amounts, in substance, to a demand for enforcement action against the IE SA for its 
(alleged)  failure  to  implement  the  IE  SA  Decisions  and  to  an  attempt  to  use  the  Article  66  GDPR 
procedure as a means to procure an order from the EDPB to compel the IE SA to impose an EEA-wide 
ban on Meta IE’s processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes57. The IE SA also 
expressed its view that it did put in place an enforcement procedure following the IE SA Decisions, 
consistent with the EDPB Binding Decisions58. 

49.  On 16 October 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway initiated legal proceedings before the Oslo District 

Court to demand the invalidation of the NO SA Order.

reference to the fine recently applied by NO SA, [Meta IE]’s processing operations as they relate to behavioural 
advertising remain unchanged at this point’.

50.  As mentioned above, on 26 September 2023, the NO SA used IMI to request the EDPB to adopt an 
urgent binding decision pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR, with the effect of ordering the implementation 
of final measures (hereinafter, the ‘NO SA Request to the EDPB’ or ‘Request to the EDPB’). 
Following  the  submission  of  the  NO  SA  Request  to  the  EDPB,  the  EDPB  Secretariat  assessed  the 
completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair of the EDPB.  

51. 

52. 

53. 

In the context of the assessment of the completeness of the file, the EDPB Secretariat contacted the 
NO SA on 4 October 2023 and 11 October 2023 requesting further documents and clarifications. In 
both cases, the NO SA responded on the same day by providing clarifications and uploading additional 
documents on IMI.    

The EDPB Secretariat also contacted the IE SA on 5 October 2023, requesting additional documents 
and clarifications. Following a request sent by the IE SA to extend the deadline initially set on 6 October, 
the EDPB Secretariat extended the deadline to 9 October 2023. On 9 October, the IE SA replied by 
attaching some of the additional documents and providing some clarifications. On the basis of the 
reply,  the  EDPB  Secretariat  requested  on  the  same  day  some  further  information  and  provided 
clarifications on the questions it had previously asked. On 10 October 2023, the IE SA responded to the 
EDPB Secretariat’s email of 9 October 2023, highlighting the need for appropriate time to carry out 
verifications. On 11 October 2023, the EDPB Secretariat responded to the IE SA’s email identifying 
certain items as matters of priority. On 12 October 2023, the IE SA responded to the EDPB Secretariat’s 
request providing several documents and clarifications.  

54.  A matter of particular importance that was scrutinised by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to good 
administration, as required by Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 
(hereinafter, the ‘Charter’). Further details on this topic are provided in Section 3 of this urgent binding 
decision.  

55.  On 12 October 2023, the decision on the completeness of the file was then taken by the Chair of the 
EDPB and on 13 October 2023 by the NO SA in line with Article 13(2) of the EDPB RoP. The file was 
circulated by the EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB on 13 October 2023.  

56.  On 17 October 2023, following a request of the IE SA to include an additional letter sent by the IE SA 
to the NO SA on 13 October 2023, the EDPB decided to include it in the file, on the basis of Article 11(2) 
EDPB RoP. 

2  COMPETENCE OF THE EDPB TO ADOPT AN URGENT BINDING 

DECISION UNDER ARTICLE 66(2) GDPR  

57. 

The EDPB is competent to issue an urgent binding decision under Article 66(2) GDPR to the extent that 
the following conditions are met: an SA has taken provisional measures pursuant to Article 66(1) GDPR, 
and there is a request from this SA pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR.59 

2.1  The SA has taken provisional measures under Article 66(1) GDPR 

58.  On 14 July 2023, the NO SA adopted provisional measures pursuant to Article 66(1) GDPR, prohibiting 
Meta  IE  from  processing  the  personal  data  of  data  subjects  residing  in  Norway  for  targeting 
                                                            
59 See Art. 66(2) GDPR and EDPB Urgent Binding Decision 01/2021 on the request under Article 66(2) GDPR from 
the Hamburg (German) Supervisory Authority for ordering the adoption of final measures regarding Facebook 
Ireland Limited (hereinafter ‘EDPB Urgent Binding Decision 01/2021’), adopted on 12 July 2021, section 2.

advertisements on the basis of observed behaviour for which Meta IE relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or 
Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

59. 

The EDPB therefore considers that this condition is satisfied. 

2.2  Existence of a request pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR coming from a SA in the 

EEA 

60.  On 26 September 2023, the NO SA requested the EDPB to adopt an urgent binding decision pursuant 
to Article 66(2) GDPR, by introducing a formal request in the IMI system (Article 17 of the EDPB RoP).  

61. 

The EDPB therefore considers that this condition is satisfied. 

62. 

63. 

64. 

2.3  Conclusion 
The EDPB concludes it is competent to adopt an urgent binding decision under Article 66(2) GDPR. 

3  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the Charter (right to good administration). This is also reflected in 
Article 11(1) EDPB RoP.    

Similarly  to  what  is  provided  under  Article  65(2)  GDPR,  an  urgent  binding  decision  of  the  EDPB  is 
addressed  to  the  lead  supervisory  authority  and  all  the  supervisory  authorities  concerned,  and  is 
binding on them60. It is not aimed to address directly any third party.  

65.  Nevertheless, the EDPB assessed whether all the documents it received to be used in order to take its 
decision were known by Meta IE and Facebook Norway, and whether Meta IE and Facebook Norway 
were offered the opportunity to exercise their right to be heard on all the elements of fact and law to 
be used by the EDPB to take its decision.    

66. 

In this respect, the NO SA informed the EDPB Secretariat that it made available all the documents it 
submitted to the EDPB to Meta IE and Facebook Norway. The other documents (submitted by the IE 
SA), if not already known to the companies, were made available to them by the EDPB Secretariat by 
way of letters of 13 October 202361 and 18 October 202362.  

67.  On 17 September 2023, the NO SA sent a letter to Meta IE and Facebook Norway asking for their 
submissions on its draft request for an Article 66(2) GDPR urgent binding decision from the EDPB. 
Following extensions of the deadline initially set, these submissions were provided on 26 September 
2023  (hereinafter,  ‘Meta  IE’s  Submissions  of  26  September  2023’  and  ‘Facebook  Norway’s 
Submissions  of  26  September  2023’).  These  submissions  also  attached  Meta  IE’s  and  Facebook 
Norway’s previous submissions of 25 August 2023 concerning the intention of the NO SA to request an 
urgent  binding  decision  of  the  EDPB  (‘Meta  IE’s  Submissions  of  25  August  2023’  and  ‘Facebook 
Norway’s Submissions of 25 August 2023’). In addition to these submissions, the file submitted to the 
EDPB also included multiple documents produced by Meta IE and/or Facebook Norway in the context 
of the assessment of compliance with the IE SA Decisions and/or in the context of the legal proceedings 
                                                            
60 Art. 65(2) GDPR. According to Art. 66(4) GDPR, this provision is derogated in respect of the deadline for 
adoption; therefore, the last sentence of Art. 65(2) GDPR fully applies.

concerning the NO SA Order63, where Meta IE’s and Facebook Norway’s positions in respect of the 
elements being considered by the EDPB were clarified.  

68.  On the basis of the assessment performed by the EDPB Secretariat, Meta IE and Facebook Norway had 
not yet had an opportunity to make their views known on some elements of fact and law included in 
some documents of the file to be used by the EDPB to take its decision. The Chair of the EDPB invited 
by way of her letter of 13 October 202364 Meta IE and Facebook Norway to provide written submissions 
to the EDPB on these elements. These submissions, together with annexes, were provided by Meta IE 
and  Facebook  Norway  on  16  October  2023  (‘Meta  IE’s  Submissions  of  16  October  2023”  and 
“Facebook Norway’s Submissions of 16 October 2023’)65 and were subsequently added to the file.  

69.  On  18  October  2023,  the  Chair  of  the  EDPB  sent  a  new  letter  to  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  Norway 
informing them of the document added to the file on 17 October 2023 and providing them with an 
opportunity  to  make  written  submissions  on  it.  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  Norway  made  written 
submissions on 19 October 2023 (‘Meta IE and Facebook Norway’s Submissions of 19 October 2023’), 
which were added to the file.   

70. 

The EDPB notes that Meta IE and Facebook Norway received the opportunity to make their views 
regarding all the legal and factual elements used by the EDPB to take this decision. Therefore, in case 
Meta IE and Facebook Norway would be found to be entitled to a right to be heard in this procedure, 
it would be in any case fully respected.  

4  ON THE NEED TO REQUEST FINAL MEASURES  

71. 

The EDPB considers that in order for an urgent binding decision adopted pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR 
to order final measures two cumulative conditions need to be fulfilled: the existence of one (or several) 
infringement(s)  and  the  existence  of  an  urgency  situation  justifying  a  derogation  from  the  regular 
cooperation procedure.  

72.  Consequently, the sections below assess first the existence of infringements (Section 4.1), then the 

existence of an urgency situation (Section 4.2). 

4.1  On the existence of infringements 

                                                            
63 By way of example, these documents included the Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 31 May 2023, the letter 
from Meta IE to the IE SA of 21 June 2023, the Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 30 June 2023, Meta IE’s 
Response to the IE SA Provisional Position Paper of 4 August 2023, Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 27 July 
2023, Letter from Meta IE to the NO SA of 27 July 2023.  
64 Letter of the Chair of the EDPB to Meta IE and Facebook Norway of 13 October 2023, replying to their letter of 
28  September  2023  where  they  requested  that  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  Norway  be  granted  access  to  any 
documents in the administrative file, and to be afforded an opportunity to make submissions after reviewing the 
file in advance of the EDPB reaching a final decision.  
65 On 18 October 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway provided new versions of two of their annexes. In these 
letters of 16 October 2023, Meta IE and Facebook Norway also informed the EDPB that they filed a complaint 
before the Oslo District Court challenging and seeking to invalidate the NO SA Order on the merits.

74. 

4.1.1.1  Summary of the overall position of the NO SA 
The NO SA requested the EDPB to adopt an urgent binding decision ordering final measures to be taken 
across the EEA to ensure that ‘personal data shall not be processed for behavioural advertising based 
on Article 6(1)(b) [GDPR] or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in the context of the Services’66. In the NO SA Request 
to the EDPB, the NO SA defines ‘behavioural advertising’ as ‘targeting ads on the basis of observed 
behaviour’ 67. In the view of the NO SA, this includes ‘targeting ads on the basis of inferences drawn 
from observed behaviour as well as on the basis of data subjects’ movements, estimated location and 
how data subjects interact with ads and user-generated content’68. This definition is in line with their 
understanding of the scope of the IE SA Decisions69. 

In the NO SA Request to the EDPB, the NO SA states that ‘[Meta IE] has failed to ensure compliance 
with (...) [the IE SA Decisions]’70. According to the NO SA, there is consensus among the CSAs that Meta 
IE’s processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes is currently infringing the GDPR, 
and in particular Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and the duty to comply with the decisions 
of the SAs71. 

75. 

The NO SA’s analysis is based on the following elements:  

•  Despite the IE SA Decisions, Meta IE still relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process (1) location 
information, including GPS location, data subjects’ activity on Meta products and the places 
data  subjects  like  to  go  and  the  businesses  and  people  data  subjects  are  near;  and  (2) 
information about ads that Meta IE shows and how data subjects engage with those ads; for 
the purpose of behavioural advertising72.  

•  Meta  IE  relies  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  to  process  some  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of 
behavioural advertising, while Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is not an appropriate legal basis for this 
processing73.  

•  The IE SA also considers that Meta IE failed to demonstrate that it has a lawful basis to process 
platform  behavioural  data  for  behavioural  advertising74,  and  did  not  provide  any 
documentation  confirming  that  it  stopped  processing  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of 
behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 75.

basis for ‘some of its processing’ of personal data. Meta IE clarifies in its Letter to the IE SA of 30 June 2023 that 
these changes relate to the personal data collected on its products (paragraph 7c). A description of this data is 
provided in section 2.3 of the Meta IE Compliance Reports.

The  NO  SA  states  that  Meta  IE  has  already  been  given  enough  time  to  bring  its  processing  into 
compliance  with  Article  6(1)  GDPR,  and  takes  the  view  that  ‘[Meta  IE]  is  making  use  of  dilatory 
strategies’76.  

The  NO  SA  considers  that  there  is  sufficient  information  to  allow  the  EDPB  to  conclude  that 
infringements are taking place77.  

4.1.1.2 

Inappropriate reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 

4.1.1.2.1  Summary of the position of the NO SA  

The NO SA takes the view that Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its 
behavioural advertising processing activities was confirmed by the EDPB Binding Decisions and the IE 
SA Decisions which concluded, in line with the views expressed in previous EDPB guidelines, that Article 
6(1)(b)  GDPR  is  an  unsuitable  legal  basis  for  behavioural  advertising  processing  activities,  both 
generally and in the case at issue78. 

The NO SA finds that Meta IE has incorrectly understood what constitutes ‘processing of personal data 
for the purposes of behavioural advertising’ in the IE SA Decisions79. It states that Meta IE’s processing 
of data subjects’ location data80 and engagement with ads81 is part of Meta IE’s processing of personal 
data for the purpose of behavioural advertising concerned by the IE SA Decisions82, and that, pursuant 
to those decisions, such processing which is based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, is unlawful83. 

4.1.1.2.2  Summary of the position of the controller 

80.  Meta IE states that, prior to the IE SA Decisions, it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in a good faith manner 
and its ‘bona fide belief that it was lawful for it to do so’84, considering that different national courts 
found that Meta IE may validly rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data for the purposes 
of behavioural advertising85.

79 NO SA Order, section 7.2.1.1, p. 14 (referring to the IE SA FB Decision paragraph 10.44(b) and the IE SA IG 
Decision paragraph 417(b), respectively). 
80 According to the NO SA, ‘[Meta IE]’s use of location data to inform which ads are displayed to data subjects 
clearly constitutes Behavioural Advertising. It is unclear to us what this location is estimated on the basis of, if not 
the data subject’s behaviour’. NO SA Order, section. 7.2.1.1, p. 15. 
81 According to the NO SA, ‘For information about data subjects’ engagement with ads, we understand that data 
subjects may click on “Hide Ad” and that one effect of this would be that the particular ad is not shown to that 
data subject again. We agree with [Meta IE]’s assertion set out in its letter of 30 June 2023 that this in itself does 
not constitute processing for Behavioural Advertising. However, to the extent that this or any other engagement 
with an ad is used to inform which other ads a data subject should see, we find that the processing of personal 
data does take place for Behavioural Advertising’, NO SA Order, section. 7.2.1.1, p. 15.

81.  Meta IE acknowledges that the IE SA Decisions concluded differently to these cases86, and argues that 
it  took  since  then  substantial  steps  to  bring  its  processing  activities  into  ‘what  it  believes  was 
compliance with those decisions’87. Meta IE states that it changed its legal basis from Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the processing of personal data collected on Meta’s products for the 
purposes of behavioural advertising to comply with the IE SA Decisions88. It states further that it relies 
on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process personal data obtained from third party advertising partners89.  

82. 

In  relation  to  the  definition  of  what  behavioural  advertising  encompasses,  Meta  IE  states  that  its 
processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising  comprises  the  use  of 
‘information collected on Meta’s products about a user’s behaviour over time in order to assess and 
understand users’ interests and preferences’. According to Meta IE, this includes signals such as ‘a 
user’s activity across Meta’s products, engagement with content such as other users’ posts or which 
pages they visit, the individuals and groups they communicate with, and/or what the user searches 
for’90. Meta IE states that it processes this personal data to assess and understand users’ interests and 
preferences, and to provide them with behavioural advertisements91. 

83.  However, Meta IE takes the view that its processing of a) demographic data (including location data), 
b)  In-use  app,  browser  and  device  data  c)  advertisement  shown  and  d)  advertisement  interaction 
data92 does not constitute behavioural advertising, and therefore falls beyond the scope of the IE SA 
Decisions93. In this respect, Meta IE argues that its processing of such data on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR is valid94.  

84.

4.1.1.2.3  Analysis of the EDPB 

95. 

 
 

The EDPB Binding Decisions instructed, inter alia, the IE SA to find an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 
on the ground that Meta IE inappropriately relied upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data 
for the purposes of behavioural advertising, and therefore lacked a legal basis to process this data for 
this purpose96. In relation to this, the EDPB also instructed the IE SA to include in each of its final

decisions an order for Meta IE to bring it processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural 
advertising in the context of the Facebook and Instagram services into compliance with Article 6(1) 
GDPR within three months97. 

86.  On the basis of the EDPB Binding Decisions, the IE SA Decisions ordered Meta IE to bring its processing 
into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR98, the IE SA ordered Meta IE to take the necessary actions to 
bring into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR and to address the finding that Meta IE is not entitled to 
process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR99. 
The EDPB notes that the IE SA made clear that such action may include, but is not limited to, the 
identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis in Article 6(1) GDPR100. 

87. 

88. 

In  the  Compliance  Reports,  Meta  IE  indicated  that  it  changed  the  legal  basis  it  relies  on  for  the 
processing of personal data collected on its products for behavioural advertising purposes from Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as of 5 April 2023, which was the deadline for compliance with the 
IE SA Decisions101. Meta IE also states that it still relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process what it 
considers to be ‘limited categories of non-behavioural information’ to show advertising on Facebook 
and Instagram102.  

In the IE SA Final Position Paper assessing Meta IE’s compliance with the IE SA Decisions and taking 
into consideration the comments received by the CSAs on such compliance, the IE SA addressed two 
key questions relevant for the purpose of this section of this urgent binding decision: the definition of 
behavioural advertising and whether the processing of Meta IE for advertising purposes relying upon 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR falls within such definition103. 

89.  As to the definition of behavioural advertising, the IE SA referred to the definition provided by the 
Article  29  Working  Party  in  its  Opinion  2/2010104  being  referred  to  by  Meta  IE  in  the  Compliance 
Reports105: 

‘Behavioural advertising is advertising that is based on the observation of the behaviour of 
individuals  over  time.  Behavioural  advertising  seeks  to  study  the  characteristics  of  this 
behaviour through their actions (repeated site visits, interactions, keywords, online content) in 
order to develop a specific profile and thus provide data subjects with advertisements tailored 
to match their inferred interests’106.

90. 

To define whether the processing of Meta IE for advertising purposes relying upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
falls  within  such  definition,  the  IE  SA  also  referred  to  the  description  of  Meta  IE’s  processing  for 
behavioural advertising purposes provided by the EDPB in the EDPB Binding Decisions107: 

‘[Meta IE] collects data on its individual users and their activities on and off its Facebook social 
network service via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group 
including  Instagram,  WhatsApp  and  Oculus,  third  party  websites  and  apps  via  integrated 
programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels 
and  comparable  technologies  placed  on  the  internet  user’s  computer  or  mobile  device. 
According to the descriptions provided, [Meta IE] links these data with the user’s Facebook 
account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on 
their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also 
include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location’ 108. 

91. 

The IE SA noted that Meta IE relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for a more limited set of personal data for 
advertising purposes in the Facebook and Instagram services109. The EDPB notes that Meta IE argues 
that it is relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of ‘limited non-behavioural information’ to 
show advertisements, as described in its Compliance Reports110: 

‘a) Demographic data. This consists of age users provide, gender users provide, and estimated 
general location. The use of demographic data is required to ensure advertising is appropriate 
in  accordance  with  the  Terms  of  Use/Service.  For  example,  (...)  (c)  relying  on  location  is 
necessary to ensure advertisements that [Meta IE] show users are in an appropriate language 
and relate to an appropriately located company or service (e.g., [Meta IE] does not show users 
advertisements for products which are not available in their country); 
 
b) In-use app, browser and device data. (...) This includes the type of device being used, the 
language chosen on the device at that time and the version of the Facebook/Instagram app 
being  used.  These  data  points  are  necessary  to  deliver  advertisements  appropriately.  For 
example, to properly format the advertisement to meet the viewing requirements of the device, 
to avoid users being shown advertisements for apps which are not supported by the operating 
system on their device, and ensure that the advertisement is in the chosen language of the user; 
 
c)  Advertisements  shown.  This  consists  of  information  on  whether  the  advertisement  is 
rendered and delivered to a user. This information is a basic metric which [Meta IE] needs in 
order, for example, to ensure the number of advertisements that [Meta IE] shows to users is at 
an appropriate level and to ensure that the same advertisements are not being directed to the 
user repeatedly. The information does not indicate whether the user has actually noticed the 
advertisement; 
 
d) Advertisement interaction data. This consists of two forms of information provided by users 
if  they  choose  to  interact  with  advertisements:  (a)  to  provide  negative  feedback  on  their 
advertising experience, for example by selecting to “hide” or report an advertisement; and (b)

advertisements they find relevant’. 111 
 

The EDPB notes the IE SA’s following findings: 

92. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

In relation to location data, the IE SA took the view that Meta IE did not provide sufficient 
information  to  allow  the  IE  SA  to  understand  why  location  data  would  fall  outside  the 
definition of behavioural data112. According to the IE SA, Meta IE did not explain whether it is 
processing the user’s physical location or the location that they proactively provide to Meta IE 
to target ads to them. 
In relation to device data, the IE SA indicated that device information could also be used to 
identify  different  market  segments,  which  in  turn  could  be  processed  for  behavioural 
advertising purposes113.  
In relation to advertisements shown, the IE SA indicated that more clarity from Meta IE would 
be required as to whether Meta IE only analyses records of ads shown (which, according to 
the IE SA, are not amounting to behavioural data) or also behavioural ads presented by other 
tools through a shared interface screen, which would also add to the behavioural processing 
by Meta IE114.  
In relation to advertisement interaction data, the IE SA underlined that ‘interaction data’ was 
listed  in  the  definition  of  behavioural  advertising  in  the  Article  29  Working  Party  Opinion, 
which  was  incorporated  by  Meta  IE  into  its  Compliance  Reports115.  The  IE  SA  therefore 
underlined  the  lack  of  clarity  on  how  Meta  IE  would  then  distinguish  ‘advertisement 
interaction data’, listed in point d) above from ‘interaction data’ included in the Article 29 
Working Party Opinion 2/2010. The IE SA raised concerns as to the fact that Meta IE stated 
that  it  relies  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  in  circumstances  where  the  user  provides  positive 
advertising feedback116. According to the IE SA, this falls within the definition of behavioural 

                                                            
111 Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA FB Decision, paragraph 5.8.2; Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA IG 
Decision, paragraph 5.8.2. 
112 In particular, the IE SA stated that ‘[Meta IE] has explained the uses of this data, but not why these uses do not 
amount to behavioural processing. For example, it is unclear if location data is used by [Meta IE] to tailor ads to 
users on the basis of visits to certain types of shops, their travel to business hubs or holiday destinations, or the 
times of year at which they travel. If [Meta IE] use location data in these ways, then this would be processing 
personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising, both by reference to the EDPB’s description of such 
advertising, as set out at paragraph 7.4 above, and by reference to the Article 29 Working Party Opinion relied 
on by [Meta IE]’, IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.11.  
113  The  IE  SA  stated  that  ‘it  is  unclear  whether  [Meta  IE]  identifies  device  information  as  a  different  market 
segment. While the processing of device information to serve ads may not amount to behavioural advertising, it 
is possible that [Meta IE] identifies certain devices as a different market segment. The type of device could indicate 
spending  power  or  history,  which  could  be  processed  for  behavioural  purposes’,  IE  SA  Final  Position  Paper,

Report on IE SA FB Decision, p. 4 and Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA IG Decision, p. 4. 
116  The  IE  SA’s  concerns  relate  in  particular  to  Meta  IE’s  statement  that  when  ‘the  user  provides  positive 
advertising feedback (e.g., actively choosing to click on a specific ad they find relevant and want to see), [Meta 
IE] similarly needs to use that information to ensure it is providing the user with an appropriate and relevant 
personalised advertising experience pursuant to the Terms of Service’, see IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 
7.14, referring to Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA FB Decision, paragraph 5.8.2 and Meta IE Compliance 
Report on IE SA IG Decision, paragraph 5.8.2.

advertising provided by the Article 29 Working Party Opinion 2/2010 as it involves Meta IE 
‘inferring conclusions about user preferences from users’ interaction with an advertisement’117. 
Following further information provided by Meta IE on 30 June 2023 to the IE SA on negative 
advertising feedback118, the IE SA indicated that, to the extent that Meta IE ‘processes personal 
data solely to prevent a specific hidden ad being shown to a user, then the [IE SA] agrees that 
this does not amount to behavioural advertising. However, to the extent that [Meta IE] infers 
a user’s advertising preferences from the fact that they have hidden an ad, then this does fall 
within the definition of behavioural advertising’119. The IE SA added that ‘[Meta IE] submissions 
are too vague to determine whether it processes personal data just to hide the specific ad, or 
whether it draws inferences from the choice to hide an ad. The reference in the justification of 
this processing to a user’s “personal advertising experience” indicates that the decision to hide 
one ad could be used to infer preferences about the ads that a user receives more generally’120. 
The EDPB notes that this appreciation is in line with the observations made by the DE Hamburg 
SA121. The IE SA therefore provided that ‘it appears from the information provided by [Meta IE] 
that  it  uses  data  about  hidden  ads  to  engage  in  behavioural  advertising’.  The  IE  SA  also 
provided similar conclusions for the positive feedback, raising that ‘Using information about 
click-throughs to determine what types of ads a user wants to see in the future falls plainly 
within the definition of behavioural advertising provided by [Meta IE] to the [IE SA]’122. 

93.

95. 

In light of the above, the EDPB notes that the IE SA found that Meta IE still conducts some processing 
for the purposes of behavioural advertising in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR123.  

In addition, the IE SA also indicated the lack of sufficient information to explain why categories (a) to 
(d) were not behavioural data124. The EDPB also notes that on this basis, the IE SA found that Meta IE 
had not demonstrated compliance with the IE SA Decisions as regards reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
for behavioural advertising125.  

The EDPB notes that this view was also expressed by certain CSAs replying to the IE SA IMI Informal 
Consultations. More specifically, the FI SA stated that ‘the following personal data seems to be still 
unlawfully collected for behavioural advertising purposes under Article 6(1)(b) [GDPR]: “Information 
                                                            
117 IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.15.  
118 Meta IE said that ‘with respect to negative advertising feedback, if a user selects the option that is available 
to  “Hide  Ad  –  never  see  this  ad  again,”  then  [Meta  IE]  needs  to  use  that  information  to  ensure  that  choice 
regarding  the  user’s  personal  advertising  experience  (i.e.,  what  advertisements  they  do  not  want  to  see)  is 
respected’, IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.16. 
119 IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.16, referring to the comments of the DE Hamburg SA on the IE SA 
Provisional Position Paper.  
120 IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.16. 
121 ‘Allowing [Meta IE] to further justify whether it processes personal data only to hide a particular ad, or whether 
it draws inferences from the decision to hide an ad, is nothing more than leaving a choice not to describe the 
actual purpose of the processing, to formally fall short of the definition of behavioural advertising. In doing so, 
hiding certain ads without anything deriving from that decision would contradict [Meta IE]´s business model. To 
the extent that this or other engagement with an ad is used to learn what other ads a data subject should see, 
Hamburg SA notes that the processing of personal data serves purposes of behavioural advertising’, Views of DE 
Hamburg SA of 4 May 2023; as referred to in the IE SA Final Position Paper, paragraph 7.17.

about ads we show you and how you engage with those ads” and “Location information”’.126 The IT SA 
also stated that ‘[Meta IE]’s proposal is not such as to adequately implement the order to bring the 
processing into compliance insofar as it misclassifies part of the user-related information and thereby 
applies the legal basis of contractual performance under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to the serving of ads 
which, actually, are behavioural in nature’ 127.  

96. 

The EDPB observes that if any of the data listed in paragraph 91 of this urgent binding decision may be 
considered as falling within the scope of the definition of behavioural advertising, there are grounds 
for finding that Meta IE is infringing Article 6(1) GDPR. This is because Meta IE would still be processing 
personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, although 
it was considered unlawful by the IE SA Decisions128.  

97. 

In this respect, the EDPB shares the IE SA’s view that Meta IE still conducts some processing of personal 
data for the purposes of behavioural advertising in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR129, at least for the 
following categories of data: 

• 

Location  data  -  the  EDPB  finds,  in  line  with  the  view  of  the  IE  SA,  that  Meta  IE  failed  to 
demonstrate  that  its  processing  of  location  data  does  not  constitute  processing  for  the 
purpose of behavioural advertising130. It is unclear to the EDPB, as it is to the NO SA and the IE 
SA, on which basis the location is estimated, if not the data subject’s behaviour. The EDPB 
consequently finds, in line with the view of the NO SA, that Meta IE’s processing of location 
data to inform which ads are displayed to data subjects constitutes behavioural advertising131.  
•  Advertisement interaction data - the EDPB finds, in line with the view of the IE SA, that Meta 
IE  failed  to  demonstrate  that  its  processing  of  advertisement  interaction  data  does  not 
constitute processing for the purpose of behavioural advertising. The EDPB shares the view of 
the IE SA that ‘[Meta IE] is recording the behaviour of the users when they are presented with 
ads and use that to tailor future presentation of ads’132. The EDPB consequently finds that Meta 
IE’s processing of advertisement interaction data constitutes behavioural advertising for the 
following reasons:  

o  As rightly pointed out by the IE SA, the EDPB recalls that interaction is listed among 
the data types in the definition of behavioural advertising in the Article 29 Working 
Party Opinion 2/2010133.  

o  The EDPB observes that irrespective of whether the data subject provides negative or 
positive feedback on the ads they see, Meta IE states that the interactions will be used 
to provide an ‘appropriate and relevant advertising experience’134 which indicates that 
Meta IE is inferring conclusions about user preferences from such interaction.

o  With respect to negative feedback (i.e., where the data subject clicks to hide/report 
an ad), the EDPB observes that Meta IE states that it needs to use this information ‘to 
ensure  that  choice  regarding  the  user’s  personal  advertising  experience  (i.e.,  what 
advertisements they do not want to see) is respected’135. The EDPB also observes that 
Meta IE states that the options ‘Hide Ad’ and ‘Report Ad’ are used to ‘directly influence 
the ads [users] see’136. The EDPB shares the view of the IE SA that ‘the reference in the 
justification of this processing to a user’s “personal advertising experience” indicates 
that the decision to hide one ad could be used to infer preferences about the ads that 
a user receives more generally’137 and therefore that ‘it appears from the information 
provided by [Meta IE] that it uses data about hidden ads to engage in behavioural 
advertising’138. 

o  With respect to positive feedback, the EDPB observes that Meta IE states that when 
‘the user provides positive advertising feedback (e.g., actively choosing to click on a 
specific ad they find relevant and want to see), [Meta IE] similarly needs to use that 
information  to  ensure  it  is  providing  the  user  with  an  appropriate  and  relevant 
personalised  advertising  experience  pursuant 
the  Terms  of  Service’139. 
Consequently, the EDPB also shares the view of the IE SA that this practice falls within 
the definition of behavioural advertising provided by the WP29 Opinion as it involves 
Meta IE ‘inferring conclusions about user preferences from users’ interaction with an 
advertisement’140.

98. 

99. 

In conclusion, the EDPB finds that Meta IE is inappropriately relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process 
location  data  and  advertisement  interaction  data  collected  on  its  products  for  the  purpose  of 
behavioural advertising.  

In addition, the EDPB shares the view of the IE SA that Meta IE did not provide sufficient information 
to explain why other categories of data processed by Meta IE do not amount to behavioural data, such 
as device data and advertisements shown141. In this respect, the EDPB finds, in line with the view of 
the IE SA, that in relation to device data, if Meta IE would use device data to identify different market 
segments,  this  would  constitute  a  processing  for  behavioural  advertising  for  which  it  would  rely 
inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b), infringing Article 6(1) GDPR142.

4.1.1.3  Inappropriate reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 

4.1.1.3.1 

Summary of the position of the NO SA 

100.  The NO SA considers that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR does not constitute an appropriate legal basis under 

Article 6(1) GDPR for Meta IE’s behavioural advertising processing143. 

101.  The NO SA refers to the IE SA Final Position Paper, in which the IE SA concluded that Meta IE continues 
to fail to rely on a valid legal basis to process personal data for behavioural advertising purposes under 
Article 6(1) GDPR, despite Meta IE’s switch to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for its behavioural 
advertising processing on 5 April 2023144. The NO SA outlines that this conclusion was supported by 
several CSAs explicitly, without any objection being raised by the other CSAs145. 

102.  Further, the NO SA states that paragraph 117 of the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment validates the 
conclusion  that  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  does  not  constitute  an  appropriate  legal  basis  for  Meta  IE’s 
behavioural advertising processing146. In this respect, the NO SA acknowledges Meta IE’s view that the 
judgment  is  irrelevant  and  relates  to  a  different  aspect  of  Meta  IE’s  processing  for  behavioural 
advertising147.  However,  the  NO  SA  argues  that  the  ruling  does  apply  to  Meta  IE’s  behavioural 
advertising practices in general and, therefore, that it cannot be disregarded148.  

4.1.1.3.2 

Summary of the position of the controller  

103.  In its Compliance Reports, Meta IE states that it has changed its legal basis from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for ‘Behavioural Advertising Processing’ - solely for personal data collected on 
Meta’s products149 - to comply with the IE SA Decisions150.  

104.  As mentioned in paragraph 81 above, Meta IE defines the scope of this processing operation processed 

on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as follows:  

‘Behavioural Advertising Processing comprises the use by [Meta IE] of information collected on 
[Meta’s] products about a user’s behaviour over time in order to assess and understand users’

144 NO SA Request to the EDPB, p. 5. As specified in paragraph 104 below, Meta IE defines the scope of this 
processing operation processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR as relating to personal data collected on Meta’s 
products. 
145 NO SA Request to the EDPB, p. 5.  
146 NO SA Request to the EDPB, p. 5. 
147 NO SA Request to the EDPB, p. 6. As specified in paragraphs 109 and 142 below, in paragraph 1.5 (A) of Meta 
IE’s  Response  to  the  IE  SA’s  Provisional  Position  Paper  of  4  August  2023,  Meta  IE  considers  that  the 
Bundeskartellamt Judgment ‘does not rule out Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] “as a matter of principle” as a valid legal 
basis for [Meta IE]’s Behavioral Advertising Processing. The judgment assessed Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] (and the 
element of “necessity”) in the context of different processing than is at-issue here (i.e., data collected off-[Meta], 
and to a limited extent cross-product data processing, as opposed to data collected on-[Meta] products). (...) 
Further, the CJEU did not (and could not as a matter of law) issue a blanket finding that users’ interests will always 
outweigh [Meta IE]’s and third parties’ legitimate interests in the context of personalised advertising (...).’ 
148 NO SA Request to the EDPB, p. 6.  
149  Meta  IE  indicates  to  rely  on  Art.  6(1)(a)  GDPR  to  process  personal  data  about  users’  activity  off-Meta’s 
products (such as on third-party websites, apps and certain offline interactions (e.g., purchases)), obtained by 
Meta IE from third party advertising partners for the purposes of showing personalised advertising to these users 
on Facebook or Instagram (see Meta IE Compliance Report on IE SA FB Decision, p. 12, paragraph 3.1.2, and Meta 
IE Compliance Report on IE SA IG Decision, p. 13, paragraph 3.1.2).

interests  and  preferences.  This  includes  signals  such  as  a  user’s  activity  across  [Meta’s] 
products, engagement with content such as other users’ posts or which pages they visit, the 
individuals and groups they communicate with, and/or what the user searches for. [Meta IE] 
uses  all  of  these  signals  to  assess  and  understand  users’  interests  and  preferences  and  to 
provide them with behavioural advertisements.’ (emphasis added in bold)151 

 

105.  With  respect  to  the  above,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  personal  data  processed  for  behavioural 
advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is collected ‘on’ and ‘across’ Meta’s products 
and that these terms are used interchangeably by Meta IE. 

106.  Meta IE also refers to its updated privacy policies for Facebook and Instagram, which provide the list 

of categories of personal data processed for this purpose152. 

107.  In  Meta  IE’s  view,  it  was  entitled  to  consider  that  it  could  switch  to  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  its 
behavioural advertising processing to comply with the IE SA Decisions153. According to Meta IE, neither 
the EDPB Binding Decisions nor the IE SA Decisions ordered Meta IE to rely on a specific legal basis 
under Article 6(1) GDPR, such as Article 6(1)(a) GDPR154. Meta IE argues that it is only once the IE SA 
adopted the IE SA Final Position Paper on 18 August 2023 that an authority concluded that Meta IE’s 
reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR was insufficient to comply with the IE SA Decisions155. Meta IE argues 
that  prior  to  this  date  ‘[s]ome  SA  submissions  are  inconsistent  with  one  another  and  cannot  be 
reconciled (for example (...) certain SAs appear to consider that consent is the only viable basis possible 
whereas others accept Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is viable)’156.  
 

108.  Meta IE carried out Legitimate Interests Assessments annexed to its Compliance Reports157, in which 
it  concludes  that  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  constitutes  an  appropriate  legal  basis  for  behavioural 
advertising158. Meta IE reiterates this conclusion on 4 August 2023, after having made a commitment 
to  switch  to  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR  through  the  Meta  IE’s  Consent  Proposal159.  In  addition,  Meta  IE 
highlighted that it ‘expended significant resources’ and implemented ‘very substantial steps’ to switch 
from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to comply with the deadline of 5 April 2023160. 

109.  With respect to the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment, Meta IE takes the view that this case ‘does not 
rule out Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] as a matter of principle as a valid legal basis’ for Meta IE’s behavioural

advertising processing activities, given that the CJEU ‘did not (and could not as a matter of law) issue 
a blanket finding that users’ interests will always outweigh [Meta IE]’s and third parties’ legitimate 
interests  in  the  context  of  personalised  advertising’161.  It  argues  that  the  CJEU  Bundeskartellamt 
Judgment relates to a different processing than the processing covered by the EDPB Binding Decisions 
and the IE SA Decisions. More specifically, Meta IE points out that this judgment relates to personal 
data collected off-Meta, as opposed to data collected on-Meta products. Notably, Meta IE states that 
the scope of the case, ‘excludes processing for behavioural advertising purposes when using personal 
data collected across different [Meta IE]’s products’, while acknowledging that the case focuses ‘to a 
lesser extent’ on ‘the processing of personal data collected across various [Meta IE]’s products’162. 
 

110.  Lastly, despite considering that it can lawfully rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, Meta IE announced that, 
taking into account the ‘different views’ of the IE SA both in the IE SA Provisional Position Paper and 
regarding  the  interpretation  of  the  CJEU  Bundeskartellamt  Judgment,  it  was  willing  to  switch  to 
consent for the processing at stake163.

Analysis of the EDPB 

111.  In the IE SA Decisions, Meta IE was directed to take the necessary action to address the finding that 
Meta IE is not entitled to carry out the processing operations at stake on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR, was ordered to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising 
into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR and it was specified that such action is ‘not limited to the

identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis’, but may include the implementation of ‘any 
necessary measures required to satisfy the conditionality associated with that/those alternative legal 
basis/bases’ 168. 

112.  The EDPB notes that, according to Meta IE Compliance Reports and the IE SA Final Position Paper, Meta 
IE  relies  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  to  process  personal  data  collected  on  Meta’s  products169  for  the 
purposes of behavioural advertising since 5 April 2023170. 

113.  Pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, Recital 47 GDPR and the CJEU’s settled case-law171, three cumulative 
conditions must  be  met  to  be  able  to  rely  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR, ‘namely,  first,  the  pursuit  of  a 
legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data 
for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, [according to a balancing test] that the 
interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not 
take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party’172.   

114.  More specifically, the first condition relates to the existence of legitimate interests pursued by the 

controller or a third party. 

115.  Meta IE has identified different interests that it considers legitimate and on which it relies for the 
processing at stake. These interests are pursued either by Meta IE or third parties, namely businesses 
that  use  Facebook/Instagram  and  other  users  of  Meta’s  products173.  More  specifically,  Meta  IE 
identified the four following legitimate interests:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

(1) Meta IE’s ‘interest and the interests of other users to provide a positive user experience that 
users will want to engage with, and which is tailored to users - providing quality targeted and 
personalised ads is a core element of the wider user experience across Meta Products’,  
(2) Meta IE’s ‘interest and the interests of other users to enable [Meta IE] to generate revenue 
and continue to innovate, improve and develop the Meta Products and new technologies’,  
(3) Meta IE’s and third parties’ (e.g. advertisers) interests ‘to provide businesses, both big and 
small, the opportunity to connect with the users who are most likely to be interested in their 
products and services’, and  
(4) Meta IE’s ‘interests and the interests of third parties (e.g. advertisers) and other users, for 
businesses, both big and small, to be able to promote their products and services to users’174.

116.  These  four  categories  of  interests  are  further  broken  down  in  several  sub-interests  in  Meta  IE 
Legitimate Interests Assessments175. For example, the first and the second legitimate interests also 
include  the  following  sub-interest:  ‘[For  other  Facebook  and  Instagram  users:]  The  enjoyment  of 
Facebook and Instagram services free of charge’.176 

117.  As recalled by the IE SA, the given legitimate interests must be ‘sufficiently clearly articulated and [be] 
real  and  present,  corresponding  to  current  activities  or  to  benefits  that  are  expected  in  the  near 
future’177.  

118.  The EDPB notes that the IE SA concluded that the interests listed by Meta IE in its Compliance Reports 

can meet these criteria178. 

119.  The second condition relates to the necessity of the processing for the pursuit of those interests (or 

‘necessity test’).  

120.  In its Compliance Reports, Meta IE considers that: (1) the processing at stake is necessary to pursue 
and achieve  the legitimate interests identified by  Meta IE179, (2)  this processing is reasonable and 
proportionate to achieve the legitimate interests pursued180 and (3) no viable alternatives exist that 
would allow the legitimate interests to be achieved181. 

121.  In that regard, the IE SA considers that Meta IE failed to demonstrate in its Compliance Reports that 
its  behavioural  advertising  processing  was  necessary  to  the  different  legitimate  interests  it 
identified182. More specifically, the IE SA points out that Meta IE’s explanations regarding the impact 
of the processing at stake are ‘too vague’ and therefore they do not allow the IE SA to determine that 
there is a less intrusive alternative that Meta IE could pursue183. In addition, the IE SA considers that 
Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments do not apply the necessity test for each of the legitimate 
interest on which it relies184. 

122.  More specifically, regarding the first interest set out by Meta IE, the IE SA refers to the EDPB Binding 
Decision 3/2022 and concludes that behavioural advertising is not in the interest of all Meta IE’s users, 
but only of some users185. Therefore, according to the IE SA, Meta IE has not explained the need to

process the personal data of all of its users ‘for the purposes of realising the interests of those users 
who want to receive behavioural advertising’186.  

123.  Further, regarding the second, third and fourth interests put forward by Meta IE in its Compliance 
Reports187, the IE SA concludes that Meta IE’s arguments are not sufficiently substantiated because of 
the vagueness and the lack of specificity of the analysis188. In particular, Meta IE has not explained 
which specific categories of personal data Meta IE needs to process or which processing operations 
need to take place to achieve the above interests189.  

124.  When conducting the ‘necessity test’ in the Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments, Meta IE claims 
that ‘Without the Processing, which as explained above is essential in order to monetise Facebook and 
Instagram, [Meta IE] would not be able to provide the services to users free of charge in the same 
manner as it does currently. This in turn would jeopardise the attainment of the legitimate interests 
identified  above’190.  According  to  Meta  IE,  if  it  did  not  carry  out  the  processing  of  personal  data 
collected  on  its  products  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising  and  if  it  only  carried  out  the 
‘limited’ processing it engages in when data subjects object, it ‘would significantly impact the user 
experience on Facebook and Instagram (in part, due to less innovation happening on the platforms due 
to reduced revenue) and it would also impact [Meta IE]’s ability to provide Facebook and Instagram 
free of charge (regardless of the financial means of the user) to users as this is largely due to the 
revenues that [Meta IE] makes from enabling advertisers to effectively advertise to Instagram and 
Facebook users’191. 

125.  However, the IE SA points out that Meta IE’s privacy policy states that Meta IE is pursuing a legitimate 
interest ‘to generate revenue’, which is different than providing services for free192. According to the 
IE SA, given that other types of advertising may also generate revenue, it cannot be concluded that 
behavioural advertising is necessary to generate ‘any revenue at all’193. 

126.  The IE SA also highlights that ‘there is no explanation as to why it is necessary to process all the data 
categories that [Meta IE] uses for behavioural advertising in order to provide the services for free’194. 
Against this background, the IE SA concludes that Meta IE’s claim that it is necessary to carry out 
behavioural advertising to provide Meta IE’s services is not sufficiently granular195. In particular, it is 
unclear  whether,  through  this  argument,  Meta  IE  is  saying  that  (1)  Meta  IE  is  unable  to  provide 
Facebook and Instagram for free unless it processes the personal data of all of its users for the purpose

of behavioural advertising, or (2) Meta IE is still able to provide Facebook and Instagram for free by 
processing the personal data of some of its users who do not object to behavioural advertising196. 

127.  The IE SA’s conclusion for the second condition was shared by a number of CSAs in their comments 

and reactions on the Compliance Reports: 

•  On 4 May 2023, the NL SA outlined that ‘[t]he massive processing of users’ (special) personal 
data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising  is  not  ‘necessary’  for  the  purposes  of  the 
declared interests’197.  

•  On 23 May 2023, the IT SA notes in relation to Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments that 
‘it is as if the controller were shifting the burden of proof regarding legitimate interest as the 
legal basis of processing on the data subjects – who conversely should be called into play as 
key actors in the two subsequent steps of the legitimate interest test, i.e. when assessing the 
necessity of the processing and performing the required balancing exercise’198. 

• 

In the NO SA Order, the NO SA argues that Meta IE fails to show that it fulfils the ‘necessity 
test’ based on (1) the absence of assessment of the necessity of each interest put forward by 
Meta  IE,  (2)  the  absence  of  a  substantiated  assessment  regarding  alternative  advertising 
models  that  could  be  viable,  (3)  the  incorrect  finding  in  Meta  IE  Legitimate  Interests 
Assessments that its behavioural advertising processing is unlikely to have an adverse impact 
on data subjects, and (4) the inappropriate reference to the fact that other businesses are also 
carrying out behavioural advertising, which does not have an impact on the lawfulness of such 
processing199. 

128.  According to the settled case-law of the CJEU, when applying the necessity test, ‘it should be borne in 
mind that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in 
so far as is strictly necessary’200. 

129.  In  its  Bundeskartellamt  Judgment,  the  CJEU  also  recalled  that  this  second  condition  requires  ‘to 
ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as 
effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in 
particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by 
Articles  7  and  8  of  the  Charter’201.  This  condition  must  also  be  examined  in  conjunction  with  the 
principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR202.

130.  In the EDPB Binding Decisions, the EDPB considered that there are realistic, less intrusive alternatives 

to behavioural advertising, making the processing at stake not ‘necessary’203. 

131.  In light of the above, the EDPB considers that there are grounds for concluding, as the IE SA did204, that 
Meta IE failed to fulfil the second condition of the ‘necessity test’ to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(f) 
GDPR for the processing of personal data collected on Meta’s products for purposes of behavioural 
advertising, in particular whether there are no other means that are less intrusive alternatives205 and 
regarding compliance with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR206. 

132.  The third condition relates to the ‘balancing test’.  
133.  In  its  Compliance  Reports  referring  to  the  Meta  IE  Legitimate  Interests  Assessments,  Meta  IE  has 
concluded that, in light of the ‘extensive measures and safeguards’ it implemented, the potential risks 
to data subjects identified are ‘appropriately mitigated’207. 

134.  More specifically, Meta IE refers inter alia to the following safeguards: the measures implemented to 
ensure transparency towards data subjects (e.g. through privacy policies and ‘Help center’ articles), 
the publication of advertising policies for users, the existence of restrictions on targeting criteria, the 
existence of control tools (in relation to advertising in general or to specific ads that are displayed to 
users)208, the possibility to object to the processing209 and the possibility to exercise data subjects’ data 
protection rights210. Meta also argues that the language introduced to explain the change of legal basis 
and the impact on users, including their ability to object to the behavioural advertising processing at 
stake, ‘have been implemented to ensure that users have a reasonable expectation of Behavioural 
Advertising  Processing  and  are  aware  of  their  right  to  object  to  this  processing211’.  In  Meta  IE’s 
Legitimate Interests Assessments, Meta further claims that ‘Users reasonably expect the processing of 
Platform  Behavioural  Information  for  behavioural  advertising,  taking  into  account  the  robust 

                                                            
203 EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022, paragraph 121 and the EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022, paragraph 124. As 
eluded to in the EDPB Binding Decisions, the AT SA, PL SA (only for EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022) and SE SAs 
mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, which do not involve 
intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users. This analysis was made in the context of the legal basis 
of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

transparency [Meta] has implemented (...), which contributes to managing user expectations around 
the Processing and personalised advertising more broadly’212. 

135.  In that regard, the EDPB notes that the IE SA concluded that, due to the failure to facilitate the right to 
object under Article 21 GDPR213, the lack of any consideration of the right to private life (as enshrined 
in Article 7 of the Charter)214 or data minimisation215, and the insufficient consideration of the impact 
of  the  processing  on  the  purpose  limitation  principle216,  Meta  IE  has  not  demonstrated  that  its 
legitimate interests in processing for behavioural advertising outweigh the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of data subjects217. In particular regarding the right to object, the IE SA pointed out inter alia 
that ‘there is no ability in these [objection] tools to turn off processing of data collected directly by 
[Meta  IE]  for  advertising  purposes,  including  content,  audio,  metadata  about  content,  apps  and 
features used, transactions, hashtag and the time, frequency and duration of activities on [Meta IE] 
products’ as these categories of data would still be used for the purpose of behavioural advertising 
according to Meta IE’s privacy policy218. 

136.  The IE SA also refers to a previous CJEU judgment of 24 September 2019, where the CJEU held that the 
data subjects’ fundamental rights under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter ‘override, as a rule (...) the 
economic interest’ of a private operator219. 

137.  The conclusion of the IE SA regarding the third condition was shared by a number of CSAs in their 

comments and reactions on the Meta IE Compliance Reports: 

•  On 4 May 2023, the NL SA concluded that ‘[t]he fundamental rights and freedoms of the data 
subject override the interest of [Meta IE] and the third parties involved’220. The NL SA raised 
the following considerations: 

o 

o 

‘some of the data processed by [Meta IE] for the purpose of behavioural advertising 
are special, sensitive kinds of personal data, which increase the weight attached to 
the interests of data subjects in the balancing act221’ 
‘Not only the type but also the sheer amount of data that is processed by a company 
with the size of [Meta IE] should be taken into account in the balancing act. For the 
purposes  of  behavioural  advertisement,  [Meta  IE]  processes  a  broad  spectrum  of 
(special) personal data from millions of users. These data are analysed and possibly 
stored, adjusted, and reused on a daily basis.222’

‘With regard to user expectations, the NL SA points out that, in line with the principle 
of accountability, the assessment of user expectations should take place before the 
processing is initiated under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Controllers cannot simply "retroactively 
adjust" the expectations of existing users and bring processing in line with Art. 6(1)(f) 
GDPR,  simply  by  providing  them  with  some  information  –  especially  not  when  the 
essence of this information is hard to grasp.223’ 
‘Furthermore, as also concluded by the EDPB in its decision 3/2022,20 the NL SA agrees 
with the EDPB that users do not sign up to [Meta IE]’s services to be served personalized 
content but for the sake of connecting with friends and family. Even in its changed 
Terms  of  Service,  [Meta  IE]  presents  its  services  as  “services  that  enable  people  to 
connect  with 
to 
people/friends/family is therefore still the service with which [Meta IE] seeks to attract 
new users. Even though “building businesses” is inserted as a third “goa” of the services 
of [Meta IE], this does not create the reasonable expectation that users’ personal data 
will be processed for the purpose of behavioural advertising’224. 
‘NL SA therefore concludes that users do not expect or should reasonably expect that 
their  data  are  processed  for  the  sake  of  behavioural  advertising  as  done  by  [Meta

‘Considering the gravity of the risks identified, NL SA finds that [Meta IE] indeed treads 
very lightly on these risks and their mitigation.226’ 
‘The NL SA therefore finds that the right to object as provided for in the GDPR, a core 
right when processing is undertaking on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, is therefore not 
properly respected by [Meta IE]’227.

•  On 12 May 2023, the ES SA identified the following shortcoming in Meta IE’s assessment of 

the balancing test:  

o 

‘Regarding the impact on data subjects, it is not established that it does not concern 
sensitive data. 

o  As  regards  the  way  in  which  data  is  processed,  data  is  processed  massively, 
comprehensively  and  in  combination  with  all  types  of  data  obtained  from  other 
sources, without taking into account the principle of data minimization. 

o  As regards the data subject’s reasonable expectations, the data typology reflected in 
the privacy policy is not easily understandable to the average user, who does not know 
exactly what data is being processed and what the extent of such processing is. In order 
for the user to know what type of data is being processed and how they are being 
processed, the user must also look up several documents. 

o  As regards the position of the controller and the data subject, there is no balance of 
power, Meta [IE] is a large company which imposes its conditions on its users without 
they have the possibility of choosing or not certain processing operations and which of

their  data  are  processed.  There  is  also  no  analysis  of  how  the  [processing]  affects 
vulnerable sectors, and how to mitigate possible negative effects. 

o  Finally, with regard to the additional safeguards included to prevent undue impact on 
data subjects, as already stated, the principle of data minimization is not taken into 
account,  there  is  no  indication  of  what  actions  [Meta  IE]  takes  to  prevent  the 
processing  of  sensitive  data  indirectly  and,  as  explained  below,  the  GDPR  is  not 
complied with regard to the right to object.’228 [emphasis added in bold] 

•  On 15 May 2023, the FI SA stated that ‘[Meta IE]´s legal interests assessment (...) seems to be 
rather one-sided and superficial and fails to convince why the interests of [Meta IE] or third 
parties should override the interests and fundamental rights of the data subjects’229. 

•  On 23 May 2023, the IT SA notes in relation to Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments that 
‘it is as if the controller were shifting the burden of proof regarding legitimate interest as the 
legal basis of processing on the data subjects – who conversely should be called into play as 
key actors in the two subsequent steps of the legitimate interest test, i.e. when assessing the 
necessity of the processing and performing the required balancing exercise’230. 

• 

In  the  NO  SA  Order,  the  NO  SA  rejects  Meta  IE’s  assumption  that  the  data  subjects 
undisputedly want and expect behavioural advertising based on monitoring and profiling of 
their behaviour231. Therefore, according to the NO SA, Meta IE’s assessment of the elements 
of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR has been skewed232. In addition, the NO SA refers to the paragraph 117 
of the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment, which held that ‘data subjects cannot reasonably 
expect that the operator of the social network will process that user’s personal data, without 
his  or  her  consent,  for  the  purposes  of  personalised  advertising’233.  Further,  the  NO  SA 
considers  that  informing  data  subjects  about  behavioural  advertising  processing  does  not 
mean that it falls within their reasonable expectations and in any case, data subjects are not 
realistically able to read the privacy policies of every service used, including Meta IE’s privacy 
policies234. The NO SA also argues that Meta IE fails to show that Meta IE’s interests outweigh 
the rights and freedoms of data subjects235. 

138.  The IE SA made an overall conclusion on the three-step test236 that Meta IE has not demonstrated 
compliance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the processing at stake237. The IE SA highlighted, both in the 
IE SA Provisional Position Paper and IE SA Final Position Paper that this conclusion stems from the 
following  reasons:  (1)  ‘[Meta  IE]  has  not  made  out  that  the  processing  is  necessary  for  legitimate 
interests. Its explanations of the impact of the processing on its business are too vague to allow the [IE

SA] to determine that there is no less intrusive alternative that can be pursued’, (2) ‘[Meta IE] has not 
demonstrated that the balancing favours its processing. In particular, the opt-out mechanism provided 
does not comply with the GDPR’238. The conclusions of the IE SA regarding the results of the three-step 
test was shared by a number of CSAs, which also raised the inappropriate reliance by Meta IE to Article 
6(1)(f) GDPR: 

•  On 18 April 2023, the AT SA stated that processing operations in connection with ‘behavioural 

advertising processing’ cannot be based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR239.  

• 

•  On 12 May 2023, the ES SA indicated that Meta IE Legitimate Interests Assessments ‘did not 
demonstrate  that  the  processing  carried  out  by  Meta  IE  with  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertisement can be based on [A]rticle 6(1)(f) [GDPR] since it does not meet the requirements 
of this article’240. 
In the NL SA Mutual Assistance Request sent on 30 May 2023, the NL SA expressed concerns 
as to Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, taking into account ‘the fact that the controller 
could  not  have  been  unaware  of  already  established  guidance  from  the  EDPB,  nor  of  the 
position of several CSAs on the matter, but chose to explore the path of Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] 
regardless’241. The NL SA states that ‘Meta [IE] cannot invoke Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] as a valid 
legal basis to process the personal data of its users for the purposes of behavioural advertising’, 
and that this conclusion is ‘in line with several EDPB and WP29 Guidance documents, which 
underpin  that  the  appropriateness  of  using  Article  6(1)(f)  [GDPR]  as  a  legal  basis  for  the 
processing concerned is highly questionable’ 242.  

139.  In  previous  judgments,  the  CJEU  clarified  that  when  carrying  out  the  ‘balancing  test’,  the  data 
controller ‘must take account of the significance of the data subject’s rights arising from Articles 7 and 
8 of the Charter’243. 

140.   In its Bundeskartellamt Judgment, the CJEU held the following obiter dictum:  

‘as can be seen from recital 47 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data 
subject may in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are 
processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect such processing244.’ 

‘(...) such processing must also be necessary in order to achieve that interest and the interests 
or fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject must not override that interest. In the 
context of that balancing of the opposing rights at issue, namely, those of the controller, on the 
one hand, and those of the data subject, on the other, account must be taken, as has been 
noted (...) above, in particular of the reasonable expectations of the data subject as well as the 
scale of the processing at issue and its impact on that person.245’

‘In this regard, it is important to note that, despite the fact that the services of an online social 
network such as Facebook are free of charge, the user of that network cannot reasonably 
expect that the operator of the social network will process that user’s personal data, without 
his or her consent, for the purposes of personalised advertising. In those circumstances, it 
must be held that the interests and fundamental rights of such a user override the interest of 
that operator in such personalised advertising by which it finances its activity, with the result 
that the processing by that operator for such purposes cannot fall within the scope of point 
(f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.’246 [emphasis added] 

141.  In the IE SA Provisional Position Paper issued before the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment, the IE SA 
provisionally found that Meta IE had not demonstrated compliance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR247 as Meta 
IE had not demonstrated that it could rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR248. The IE SA then confirmed that 
Meta IE has not demonstrated compliance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR following the analysis of the CJEU 
Bundeskartellamt  Judgment  as  it  states  in  its  Final  Position  Paper  that  ‘Prior  to  the  date  of  [the 
Bundeskartellamt] judgment, the [IE SA] had analysed [Meta IE]’s reliance on Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] and 
had come to the provisional conclusion that [Meta IE] had not demonstrated compliance with that 
provision’ and that ‘the CJEU indicated that there are significant barriers to [Meta IE] seeking to rely on 
Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] for the behavioural advertising processing at issue in that judgment’249. 

142.  The EDPB notes Meta IE’s arguments regarding the alleged irrelevance of the CJEU Bundeskartellamt 
Judgment250. Meta considers that this judgment ‘does not rule out Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] “as a matter 
of principle”  as  a valid legal  basis for  [Meta IE]’s Behavioral Advertising Processing. The  judgment 
assessed Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] (and the element of “necessity”) in the context of different processing 
than  is  at-issue  here  (i.e.,  data  collected  off-[Meta]251,  and  to  a  limited  extent  cross-product  data 
processing, as opposed to data collected on-[Meta] products). (...) Further, the CJEU did not (and could 
not as a matter of law) issue a blanket finding that users’ interests will always outweigh [Meta IE]’s 
and third parties’ legitimate interests in the context of personalised advertising (...)252.’ 

143.  As regards the scope of the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment, the EDPB notes the references made to 

data collection from other services of the group to which an operator belongs253.

253 In that regard, paragraph 86 of the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment states: ‘By Questions 3 and 4, which it is 
appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether and under what conditions points 
(b) and (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing 
of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of 
such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to 
third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use 
of such data, may be considered to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are 
party, within the meaning of point (b), or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or

144.  The EDPB acknowledges that the behavioural advertising processing that Meta carries out in reliance 
of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and that is examined for the purpose of this section 4.1.1.3254 relates to personal 
data collected on Meta’s products while, according to Meta IE, the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment 
mostly  relates  to  personal  data  obtained  from  third  party  advertising  partners  outside  of  Meta’s 
products. However, the EDPB considers that this Judgment, addressed to Meta IE, Meta Platforms Inc. 
and Facebook Deutschland GmbH255, outlines the way the balancing exercise may be carried out for 
the purpose of behavioural advertising, which is also relevant for personal data collected on Meta’s 
products. 

145.  The EDPB recalls its previous guidelines where it highlighted that ‘it would be difficult for controllers to 
justify  using  legitimate  interests  as  a  lawful  basis  for  intrusive  profiling  and  tracking  practices  for 
marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple 
websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering.256’  

146.   The EDPB considers that this guidance is relevant for the processing at stake carried out by Meta IE, 
which, as provided in the EDPB Binding Decisions, is intrusive given its scale and the extensive amounts 
of data that is processed by Meta IE257. In those decisions, the EDPB outlined ‘the complexity, massive 
scale  and  intrusiveness  of  the  behavioural  advertising  practice  that  Meta  IE  conducts  through  the 
Facebook [or Instagram] service’258. In other words, ‘[b]ehavioural advertising, as briefly described in 
[paragraph  95  of  the  EDPB  Binding  Decision  3/2022  and  paragraph  98  of  the  Binding  Decision 
4/2022259] is a set of processing operations of personal data of great technical complexity, which has a 
                                                            
by a third party, within the meaning of point (f). That court asks, in particular, whether, to that end, certain 
interests which it explicitly lists constitute ‘legitimate interests’ within the meaning of the latter provision.’ 
254 Meta IE indicates to rely on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR to process personal data obtained by Meta IE from third party 
advertising partners. Such data is about users’ activity off-Meta’s products. See footnotes 89 and 149 above in 
that regard.  
255 The request for a preliminary ruling in the CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment has been made in proceedings 
between Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, formerly Facebook Ireland Ltd, 
and Facebook Deutschland GmbH, on the one hand, and the Bundeskartellamt. Meta IE operates the online social 
network Facebook in the EU. See CJEU Bundeskartellamt Judgment, paragraphs 2 and 26.

by the EDPB on 25 May 2018, p. 15. This was referred to by the NO SA in the NO SA Order, p. 9. This same 
statement was reiterated by the EDPB in the EDPB Guidelines on the targeting of social media users, Version 2.0,

259 Paragraph 95 of EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022 states: ‘These requests for preliminary rulings mention that 
[Meta IE] collects data on its individual users and  their activities on and off its Facebook social network service 
via numerous means such as the service itself, other services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp 
and Oculus, third party websites and apps via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business 
Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer 
or mobile device. According to the descriptions provided, [Meta IE] links these data with the user’s Facebook 
account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer 
behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location 
to  display  content  relevant  to  the  user’s  location.  Meta  IE  offers  its  services  to  its  users  free  of  charge  and 
generates revenue through this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that

particularly massive and intrusive nature”260. The IE SA reiterated this conclusion in the IE SA Decisions: 
‘It is therefore clear that the Board considers (...) the nature and scope of the processing to be extensive, 
complex, intrusive and on a massive scale’261. 

147.  In light of the above and taking into account the legal analysis provided by the IE SA (see for example 
in paragraphs 135 and 138 above, as supported by the assessment performed by the of the CSAs), the 
EDPB  considers  that  the  interests  and  fundamental  rights  of  data  subjects  override  the  legitimate 
interests put forward by Meta IE for the processing of personal data collected on Meta’s products for 
the purposes of behavioural advertising, with the result that Meta IE did not fulfil the third condition 
of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

148.  In light of the above analysis of the EDPB from paragraph 111 to 147, the EDPB considers that Meta IE 
inappropriately relies on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data collected on its products for the 
purpose of behavioural advertising. 

4.1.1.3.4 

Conclusion as to the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 

149.  The compliance approach adopted by Meta IE has been assessed in the IE SA Final Position Paper as 

follows:  

•  Meta  IE  seeks  to  still  rely  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  to  process  some  specific  categories  of 

personal data262, for advertising purposes263; 

•  Meta IE seeks to rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process other personal data for the purposes 

of behavioural advertising264 - solely for personal data collected on Meta’s products265; 

•  Meta IE relies on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process personal data provided to Meta IE by third 

party advertising partners266.  

150.  Meta IE 

GDPR as its legal basis 

through  the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal267.  

 is willing to rely on Article 6(1)(a) 
 

151.  The EDPB highlights the need to assess the compliance of the processing activities within the scope of 
 
 

the IE SA Decisions with Article 6(1) GDPR at this point in time.

                                                            
plug-ins,  pixels  and  comparable  technologies  placed  on  the  internet  user’s  computer  or  mobile  device164. 
According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to enable 
advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer behaviour, interests, 
purchasing power and personal situation. This may also include the user’s physical location to display content 
relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through 
this personalised advertising that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in 
the same way.’

268.  For the sake of clarity, the EDPB specifies that Meta IE’s Consent Proposal 
was not assessed in its merits for the purposes of this urgent binding decision. In this regard, the EDPB 
may only take note of the existence of an ongoing evaluation of the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal by the 
IE SA and the CSAs. 

152.  According  to  the  EDPB,  there  is  an  ongoing  infringement  of  Article  6(1)  GDPR  arising  from 
inappropriate reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for processing of personal data, including location data 
and  advertisement  interaction  data  collected,  on  Meta’s  products  for  behavioural  advertising 
purposes269.  

153.  In addition, the EDPB concludes that there is an ongoing infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR arising from 
inappropriate  reliance  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  processing  personal  data  collected  on  Meta’s 
products for behavioural advertising purposes270. 

4.1.2  On the infringement of the duty to comply with decisions by supervisory authorities   

4.1.2.1  Summary of the overall position of the NO SA  

154.  According to the NO SA, since the deadline for complying with the IE SA Decisions was 5 April 2023 but 
the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR still persists more than six months later, Meta IE failed to ensure 
compliance with the IE SA Decisions, and hence infringed its duty to comply with the SAs’ decisions271. 
The NO states further that there is consensus on the European level between the IE SA and the CSAs 
that the processing continues to be unlawful272, and that ‘as acknowledged by the IE SA itself, Meta IE 
has  failed  to  ensure  compliance  with  [the  IE  SA  Decisions]’273.  The  NO  SA  stated  that  this  non-
compliance constitutes in itself an independent violation of the GDPR274 for which Article 83(5)(e) 
GDPR envisages a fine which may be imposed in addition to the fines imposed by the IE SA Decisions275.  

4.1.2.2  Summary of the position of the controller 

155.  Meta IE stated that, prior to the IE SA Decisions, it relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in a good faith manner 

and its ‘bona fide belief that it was lawful for it to do so’276.  

156.  Following to the IE SA Decisions, Meta IE argued that it took substantial steps to bring its processing 
activities into ‘what it believes was compliance with [the IE SA] decisions’277, including by changing its 
legal  basis  from  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  to  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the  processing  of  personal  data 
collected on its products for the purposes of behavioural advertising278.

157.  Meta IE takes the view that neither the EDPB Binding Decisions nor the IE SA Decisions ordered Meta 
IE to rely on a specific legal basis for the processing of personal data collected on its products for 
behavioural advertising purpose under Article 6(1) GDPR, such as Article 6(1)(a) GDPR279. As a result, 
Meta IE still currently seeks to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process some specific categories of 
personal data that it does not consider to be behavioural data280, and on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process 
other personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising281 - solely for personal data collected 
on its products282.  

158.  After considering the IE SA Provisional Position Paper (including the IE SA’s interpretation of the CJEU 
Bundeskartellamt Judgment), Meta IE stated that it was willing to implement the necessary measures 
to  rely  on  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR  as  its  legal  basis  for  processing  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising through the  Meta IE’s Consent Proposal283.

4.1.2.3  Analysis of the EDPB 

160.  The EDPB recalls that Article 60(10) GDPR provides for the duty for the controller to ‘take the necessary 
measures to ensure compliance with the decision [taken in the context of the cooperation mechanism] 
as regards processing activities in the context of all its establishments in the Union’ 286. 

161.  The EDPB also recalls that non-compliance with an order of an SA pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR 
constitutes  an  infringement  that  may  be  sanctioned  by  way  of  an  administrative  fine  pursuant  to 
Article 83(5)(e) GDPR and Article 83(6) GDPR287.

286 Article 60 GDPR. 
287 According to Art. 83(5)(e) GDPR, ‘non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on 
processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) [GDPR] or failure 
to  provide  access  in  violation  of  Article  58(1)  [GDPR]’  is  an  infringement  that  ‘shall,  in  accordance  with 
paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % 
of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher’. Art. 83(6) GDPR 
provides: ‘Non-compliance with an order by the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) [GDPR] shall, 
in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the 
case  of  an  undertaking,  up  to  4  %  of  the  total  worldwide  annual  turnover  of  the  preceding  financial  year, 
whichever is higher’.

162.  The  EDPB  confirms,  in  line  with  the  view  of  the  NO  SA288,  that  non-compliance  with  decisions  of 

supervisory authorities is in itself an independent violation of the GDPR289.   

163.  As already noted above, the IE SA Decisions required Meta IE to, inter alia, take the necessary action 
to address the finding that Meta IE is not entitled to process personal data for behavioural advertising 
on  the  basis  of  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  and  to  bring  its  processing  of  personal  data  for  behavioural 
advertising purposes into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR.290 Also, the IE SA made clear that the 
actions Meta IE should take to comply with the IE SA Decisions may include, but were not limited to, 
the identification of an appropriate alternative legal basis in Article 6(1) GDPR291 and may include the 
implementation  of  any  necessary  measures  required  to  satisfy  the  conditionality  associated  with 
that/those alternative legal basis/bases292. The deadline for compliance with the IE SA Decisions was 
5 April 2023.  

The  EDPB  notes  that  in  the  IE  SA  Final  Position  Paper,  the  IE  SA  found  that  Meta  IE  failed  to 
demonstrate compliance with the IE SA Decisions, and states that Meta IE ‘failed to demonstrate that 
it no longer relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data for behavioural advertising’ and 
‘failed to demonstrate that it has a lawful basis to process Platform behavioural Data for behavioural 
advertising’293.  

164.  The EDPB notes that the NL SA also stated that ‘As Meta [IE] has publicly stated that it already makes 
use of Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] as a legal basis, this conclusion means that - at the moment - personal data 
of millions of European data subjects are being processed without there being a valid legal basis. This 
moreover means that Meta [IE] does not comply with the [IE SA]’s order in the [IE SA Decisions] to bring 
these processing operations in line with Article 6 GDPR’.294 

165.  The EDPB notes the view of the IE SA that neither the GDPR nor Irish national law prescribes the 
manner in which the assessment of the steps taken by the controller in purported compliance with the 
orders of an SA should be carried out295. In this respect, the EDPB notes that Meta IE does not contest 
that the IE SA’s findings made subsequently to the IE SA Decisions are made ‘to implement the existing 
[IE SA] decisions pursuant to Article 60(10) GDPR’.296  

166.  In  respect  of  Meta  IE’s  argument  that  it  fully  complied  with  the  IE  SA  Decisions  by  taking,  first, 
substantial steps to bring its processing activities into compliance by 5 April 2023297 and, secondly, 
steps in the direction of the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal298, the EDPB highlights that these elements do

should be taken that the same non-compliant behaviour cannot lead to a situation where it is punished twice’,

not in themselves contradict the conclusion that at this point in time compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR 
for the processing activities within the scope of the IE SA Decisions has not yet been achieved while 
 
the deadline to implement the IE SA Decisions was 5 April 2023. 
 

 

4.1.2.4  Conclusion as to the infringement of the duty to comply with decisions by supervisory 

authorities 

167.  In light of its findings that Meta IE still relies inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal 
data, including location data and advertisement interaction data, collected on its products for the 
purpose of behavioural advertising300 and on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data collected 
on its products for the purpose of behavioural advertising301 the EDPB finds, in line with the conclusions 
drawn by the IE SA302 and with the views expressed in particular by the NO SA303 
304 in the 
course of the proceedings, that Meta IE did not achieve compliance with the IE SA Decisions within the 
deadline for compliance and is therefore currently in breach of its duty to comply with decisions by 
supervisory authorities.  

4.2  On the existence of urgency to adopt final measures by way of derogation 

from the cooperation and consistency mechanisms 

168.  The second element to assess pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR is the existence of an urgency situation 

justifying a derogation from the regular cooperation procedure.  

169.  The urgent intervention of the EDPB pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR is exceptional, and derogates from 

the general rules applicable to the regular consistency and cooperation mechanisms.  

170.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  urgency  procedure  under  Article  66(2)  GDPR  is  a  derogation  to  the 
standard consistency and cooperation mechanisms, it must be interpreted restrictively. Therefore, the 
EDPB  may  request  final  measures  under  Article  66(2)  GDPR  only  if  the  regular  cooperation  or 
consistency  mechanisms  cannot  be  applied  in  their  usual  manner,  due  to  the  urgency  of  the 
situation305. 

171.  In addition, Article 61(8) GDPR provides that, where an SA does not provide the information referred 
to in Article 61(5) GDPR within one month of receiving a mutual assistance request from another SA, 
the ‘urgent need to act under Article 66(1) [GDPR] shall be presumed to be met and require an urgent 
binding decision from the Board pursuant to Article 66(2) [GDPR]’. If such a presumption applies, the 
urgent nature of an Article 66(2) request for an urgent binding decision can be presumed and does not 
need to be demonstrated306.

172.  In the present procedure, the NO SA requested the EDPB to adopt a decision pursuant to Article 66(2) 
GDPR, in order to urgently request the IE SA to impose final measures on Meta IE. The request has 
been made following to the adoption of provisional measures pursuant to Article 66(1) GDPR307 which 
are only applicable in Norway, and are only valid for three months. 

173.  In  the  sections  below,  the  EDPB  analyses  first  whether  the  circumstances  of  the  present  case 
demonstrate the existence of urgency and the need to derogate from the cooperation and consistency 
mechanisms (section 4.2.1 below) before analysing whether the presumption described in Article 61(8) 
GDPR is applicable to the circumstances of the case (section 4.2.2). 

4.2.1  On the existence of urgency and the need to derogate from the cooperation and 

consistency mechanisms 

4.2.1.1  Summary of the position of the NO SA 

174.  The  NO  SA  considers  that  ‘Regardless  of  the  applicability  of  the  Article  61(8)  presumption,  in  the 
present case there is an urgent need for a binding decision from the EDPB in accordance with Article 
66(2) GDPR, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects’308. 

175.  According to the NO SA, the processing in question is detrimental to individuals’ fundamental rights, 
and failing to put an end to this processing would thus expose these data subjects to a risk of serious 
and irreparable harm309. In more details, the NO SA takes the view that: 

•  The infringements have been occurring for a significant amount of time and are of an especially 
serious nature, as they have a considerable impact on the users of Meta’s products whose 
online activities are ‘constantly, intrusively and opaquely monitored and profiled by Meta’, 
which ‘may give rise to the feeling that their private life is being continuously surveilled’.310 

•  The infringements affect over 250 million average monthly active users in the EU, including 
vulnerable data subjects in need of particular protection, such as minors, elderly people and 
people with cognitive disabilities311. 

•  The filtering of the specific ads that are displayed on Facebook or Instagram has an adverse 
effect on data subjects’ freedom of information and on political participation312 while creating 
‘a potential for reinforcement of existing stereotypes, and it can leave data subjects open to 
discrimination’313. 

•  Not taking urgent action to ensure compliance with the IE SA Decisions would deprive data 
subjects of the right to seek an effective remedy against a data controller from SAs under 
Article 77 GDPR314.

•  The NO SA is of the view that there is no measure that could be applied retroactively to repair 

the violation of the rights and freedoms of data subjects315. 

176.  In addition, the NO SA states that there has been a ‘continued refrainment from enforcement’ on the 
part of the IE SA316. The NO SA takes the view that despite the fact that infringements are taking place 
appears uncontroversial among supervisory authorities, ‘the IE SA appears to be unwilling to demand 
that such infringements be ceased without any further delays’317. In this respect, the NO SA states that 
the failure to firmly and expediently react to non-compliance with the IE SA Decisions not only deprives 
data subjects of the protection they are entitled to, but is also contrary to supervisory authorities’ duty 
to ensure that the GDPR is respected in practice318.  

177.  More generally, in the view of the NO SA, not reacting to Meta IE’s prolonged state of non-compliance 
would  set  a  dangerous  precedent319  as  it  would  ‘invite  dilatory  strategies  from  non-compliant 
controllers’ and undermine the authority of the IE SA, the CSAs and the EDPB320. For the NO SA, a failure 
to adopt the requested urgent binging decision in the present circumstances would entail serious risks 
that the Article 66 GDPR mechanism would turn in to a ‘paper tiger’321. 

178.  The  NO  SA  argues  that  an  EDPB  urgent  binding  decision  would  be  a  narrow  and  strictly  limited 
exception to the primacy of the LSA in ensuring compliance with an Article 60 GDPR decision and would 
not set a precedent for derogating from the standard one-stop-shop cooperation procedure322 as it 
would be issued after the completion of an Article 60 GDPR process, following the adoption by the IE 
SA of the IE SA Decisions323 and given the fact that the IE SA does not envisage to start a new Article 
60 GDPR procedure324.  

179.  Further, the NO SA argues that final measures would not interfere with 

 
commitment to change the legal basis for behavioural 
advertising  to  consent325.  According  to  the  NO  SA,  ‘if  Meta  [IE]  would  be  ordered  to  stop  all  such 
processing activities based on Article 6(1)(b) [GDPR] and [Article 6(1)] (f) pending the identification of 
a valid legal basis, it would have an incentive to expeditiously identify adequate and lawful solutions to 
resume its processing activities as soon as possible’326.

need to adopt final measures329. 

181.  The NO SA also recalls that in any event, the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal does not eliminate the urgent 
 
 
 
 
 
331. Therefore, in 
the  NO  SA’s  view,  final  measures  constitute  ‘the  only  way’  to  stop  the  harm  to  data  subjects’ 
fundamental rights332.  

330. 

4.2.1.2  Summary of the position of the controller 

182.  According to Meta IE, the circumstances of the case do not justify an urgent decision of the EDPB 
pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR333. In particular, Meta IE recalls a prior decision of the EDPB stating that 
‘the  urgency  procedure  under  Article  66(2)  GDPR  is  a  derogation  to  the  standard  consistency  and 
cooperation mechanisms, it must be interpreted restrictively. Therefore, the EDPB will request final 
measures under Article 66(2) [GDPR] only if the regular cooperation or consistency mechanisms cannot 
be applied in their usual manner due to the urgency of the situation’334.  

183.  In this respect, Meta IE notes that the comments received by the IE SA from the CSAs show that the 
cooperation  and  consistency  mechanism  being  led  by  the  IE  SA  (which  incorporates  the  views  of 
numerous CSAs in addition to the views of the NO SA), is clearly functioning in accordance with Article 
60 GDPR, and argues that there is no reason to derogate from that mechanism335. For this reason, in 
Meta IE’s view, the NO SA’s invocation of Article 66(1) GDPR and the NO SA Request to the EDPB are 
improper336. 

184.  According to Meta IE, the urgency procedure interferes with the regular cooperation mechanism that 
the IE SA has been following to implement the IE SA Decisions337. Meta IE’s view is that the process of

arguments related to the fact that Meta IE has ‘not implemented any measures that would warrant lifting the 
Order or waiving the coercive fine, as 
 the personal 
data of data subjects in Norway continue to be unlawfully processed for behavioural advertising purposes [...],

engagement between Meta IE and the IE SA pursuant to Articles 56(6) GDPR and Article 60(10) GDPR 
remains ongoing, and that there are no exceptional circumstances that would allow the NO SA to 
bypass such process338.  

185.   In addition, according to Meta IE, ‘the NO SA’s action directly conflicts with and undermines (i) the 
authority  of  the  LSA,  (ii)  the  role  of  other  supervisory  authorities  across  the  EU/EEA  who  are 
appropriately engaging via the LSA-led process and (iii) the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism’339.   

186.  Meta IE also states that the existence of a disagreement between a LSA and a CSA does not, in itself, 
create a situation of urgency as such340. In this respect, it states that ‘the fact that the [NO SA] appears 
to disagree with 
 the [IE SA] cannot justify it resorting to the use of Article 66(2) 
[GDPR]’341. Meta IE also states that there is no precedent for a SA using Article 66(2) GDPR to seek to 
‘overrule and dictate the process that a LSA has put in place to assess compliance with the LSA’s own 
orders’342.  

187.  Regarding the nature of the infringements, Meta IE is of the view that the NO SA does not provide 
evidence of their alleged seriousness, and states that behavioural advertising is a common practice, 
widespread beyond Meta’s services343.  

188.  Meta IE also argues that the fact that the behavioural advertising processing has been ongoing for 
many years does not justify any urgency but, rather, proves that there is no new element of urgency344. 
Meta IE highlights that the processing at stake in this case is the same processing as the one that has 
been ‘the subject of detailed consideration by the [IE SA] (...) for over 4 years and by the EDPB, with the 
awareness of SAs throughout’345. In this respect, Meta IE also recalls that in the EDPB Urgent Binding 
Decision 01/2021, the EDPB has established that ‘the mere continuation of processing, cannot, on its 
own, justify an urgent need to act’346. 

189.  Meta IE considers that the EDPB Binding Decisions did not mandate it to rely on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR 
for behavioural advertising processing and did not conclude either that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR was not an

for behavioural advertising purposes), given this processing has been ongoing for years with the full knowledge 
of regulators, and the only recent development is that [Meta IE] has increased the level of data subjects’ control 
over this processing’, see Meta IE’s Submissions of 16 October 2023, p. 5.

appropriate  legal  basis  for  the  processing  of  personal  data  collected  on  Meta’s  products  for  the 
purpose of behavioural advertising347. Meta IE argues that it was only with the IE SA Final Position 
Paper that it became clear to it that its reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for such processing did not 
comply with the IE SA Decisions348.  

190.  Meta IE also argues that the IE SA is not refraining from enforcing the GDPR against it, given that the 
IE SA shared a timeline with the CSAs and issued the IE SA Provisional Position Paper and then the IE 
SA Final Position Paper349. 
 
 

350.  

191.  Meta IE states further that any urgent binding decision would be counterproductive 

 
, and ultimately harm the interests of data 
subjects while generating administrative work for the EDPB, the IE SA, the CSAs and Meta IE351. In this 
respect, it also highlights that the measures requested by the NO SA through the urgency proceedings 
had already been considered as objections during the previous Article 65 GDPR process, and rejected 
by the EDPB in the EDPB Binding Decisions352.  
 
 

353. 

4.2.1.3  Analysis of the EDPB 

192.  Article  66(2)  GDPR  requires  the  SA  requesting  an  urgent  binding  decision  to  provide  reasons  for 
requesting such opinion. This includes the need for the requesting SA to demonstrate an urgent need 
to act.  

193.  Therefore, the EDPB analyses, whether, on the basis of the views of the NO SA and of the controller, 

as well as on the basis of the elements in the file, the condition of urgency is met.  

194.  In this respect, the EDPB considered in a past decision that the nature, gravity and duration of an 
infringement, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by 
them, may play an important part when deciding whether or not there is an urgent need to act in a 
particular case354.  

195.  In relation to the nature and gravity of the infringements, the EDPB notes that its findings that Meta 
IE still relies inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data, including location data 
and  advertisement  interaction  data  collected  on  its  products  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising355 and on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data collected on its products for the

purpose of behavioural advertising356 relate to the same processing activities as those referred to in 
the IE SA Decisions adopted on the basis of EDPB Binding Decisions.  

196.  In this respect, the EDPB recalls its finding from the EDPB Binding Decisions, i.e. that the nature and 
gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR are such that a risk of damage caused to data subjects 
is consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself357. In relation to Meta IE’s infringements of 
Article  6(1)  GDPR  with  respect  to  behavioural  advertisement  practices,  the  EDPB  found  that  they 
constituted a very serious situation of non-compliance with the GDPR, in relation to processing of 
extensive amounts of data358, which is essential to the controller’s business model, and harming the 
rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA359.  

197.  The EDPB also already highlighted in its EDPB Binding Decisions the ‘complexity, massive scale and 
intrusiveness  of  the  behavioural  advertising  practice  that  [Meta  IE]  conducts’360.  This  view  is  still 
currently  shared  by  the  NO  SA,  which  finds  that  Meta  IE’s  users’  online  activities  are  ‘constantly, 
intrusively and opaquely monitored and profiled’ by Meta IE, which ‘may give rise to the feeling that 
their private life is being continuously surveilled’361. This view is also still shared by the NL SA, which 
expressed great concerns with respect to the processing activities at stake in light of ‘the large amount 
of personal data being processed, the number of data subjects involved as well as the nature of the 
data that is being processed – including video, audio and mouse movement’362. 

198.  The EDPB also clarified that at the time of the adoption of the EDPB Binding Decisions, bringing the 
processing into compliance with the GDPR would allow to minimise the potential harm to data subjects 
created by the violations of the GDPR363. In the EDPB Binding Decisions, the elements of the ‘nature 
and gravity of the infringement’ 364 and the ‘number of data subjects affected’ - which were and still 
are significant365 - led the EDPB to conclude that ‘it is particularly important that appropriate corrective 
measures be imposed [...] in order to ensure that [Meta IE] complies with this provision of the GDPR’366. 

199.   When determining the transition period for bringing Meta IE’s processing into compliance with the 
GDPR, the EDPB requested that the IE SA gives ‘due regard to the harm caused to the data subjects by 
the continuation of [Meta IE]’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR during this period’367.  

200.  The need for urgent action was fully acknowledged and clearly indicated in the IE SA Decisions368.

201.  In relation to the duration of the infringement and considering the above findings that Meta IE still 
relies  inappropriately  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  and  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  to  process  personal  data 
collected  on  its  products  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising369  despite  the  fact  that  the 
deadline for complying with the IE SA Decisions was 5 April 2023, the EDPB finds that data subjects are 
still faced with data processing activities that are unlawful 370. In relation to Meta’s argument that it is 
only on 18 August 2023 that the IE SA concluded that Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for 
behavioural advertising purpose was insufficient to comply with the IE SA Decisions371, the EDPB shares 
the view of the NL SA expressed already on 30 May 2023 that ‘the controller could not have been 
unaware of already established guidance from the EDPB, nor of the position of several CSAs on the 
matter, but chose to explore the path of Article 6(1)(f) [GDPR] regardless’372. 

202.   In this respect, the EDPB can only note that every additional day during which the processing activity 
at stake takes place without reliance on an appropriate legal basis causes supplementary harm to the 
data subjects and allows Meta to continue to collect significant amounts of personal data of millions 
of  European  individuals  on  a  daily  basis  and  to  generate  significant  revenue  from  the  unlawful 
processing of the personal data of millions of data subject in the EEA373. It also observes, in line with 
the position of the NO SA, that there are no measures that could be applied retroactively to repair the 
violation of the rights and freedoms of data subjects374. 

203.  Therefore, while in some cases the fact that an infringement has been continuing for a long time may 
serve to demonstrate that an urgent need to act does not arise375, as recalled by Meta IE376, the EDPB 
considers in this case that the situation is different. To the contrary, in this case, the fact that the 
processing activities are still performed without reliance on an appropriate legal basis represents an 
element in favour of concluding that there is an urgent need for final measures to be adopted, since 
despite  the  orders  given  in  the  IE  SA  Decisions  and  the  different  discussions  regarding  their 
implementations, Meta IE still processes unlawfully personal data and still does not comply with the 
IE SA decisions377 This is not dispelled by Meta IE’s arguments on the fact that more transparency and 
an opt-out mechanism were implemented378, as these elements do not solve the underlying issue of 
the lawfulness of the processing379 and the related harm caused on data subjects.  

                                                            
be inconsistent with the need for urgent action that was clearly indicated to be required in paragraphs 286, 288 
and  290  of  the  Article  65  Decision.  It  would  further  render  meaningless  the  EDPB’s  consideration  of  the 
compliance period in terms of a fixed number of months (in this case, three)’). An analogous wording is present 
in paragraph 214 of the IE SA IG Decision.

204.  The EDPB recalls in this respect the NO SA’s argument that the failure to firmly and expediently react 
to non-compliance with the IE SA Decisions deprives data subjects of the protection that they are 
entitled to380.  

205.  The EDPB finds, in light of the above and in line with the view of the NO SA, that failing to put an end 
to the processing activities at stake and to enforce the IE SA Decisions exposes data subjects to a risk 
of serious and irreparable harm381. The NO SA, alongside other CSAs, have also expressed the view 
that  further  measures  are  urgently  needed  in  this  case  not  only  to  address  the  situation  of  non-
compliance with the GDPR but also put an end to the harm to data subjects.  

206.  The SE SA expressed the need for further action after the circulation of Meta IE Compliance Reports 

and asked ‘the [IE] SA what procedure [the SE SA] can expect going forward’382.  

207.  The NL SA

 
”383, echoing its previous call to the IE SA “to swiftly undertake adequate actions in 
order  to  cease  the  continuous  illegality  of  the  invasive  processing  of  personal  data  of  millions  of 
users’384. It is also important to recall the NL SA Mutual Assistance Request385, according to which 
‘appropriate and expedient action is required to protect the fundamental rights of millions of data 
subjects in the Netherlands as well as throughout the European Economic Area’386 and that SAs should 
be ‘acting together’ on this ‘as cooperating European supervisory authorities under the lead of the [IE 
SA]’387.  

208.  Similarly,  already  after  the  circulation  of  the  IE  SA  Provisional  Position  Paper  to  the  CSAs,  the  DE 
Hamburg  SA  requested  the  IE  SA  ‘to  swiftly  reach  a  consolidated  position  that  [Meta  IE]  has  not 
demonstrated the legal basis and suspend the processing, which is based on Art[icle] 6 (1) [(b) GDPR] 
and [Article 6 (1)] (f) GDPR for behavioural advertising’388.  

209.  In  the  EDPB  Binding  Decisions,  the  EDPB  made  clear  that  urgent  action  was  already  required  in 
December 2022 and decided that, at that time, the order for compliance to be imposed on Meta IE 
should require Meta IE to restore compliance within a short period of time389. In doing so, the EDPB

(ii) ‘Of its conclusion as to whether [Meta IE] does or does not comply with the [IE SA]’s final decision of 31

(iii) ‘Of a timeframe in which appropriate and expedient action will be taken to ensure that [Meta IE] acts in

the [NL SA] attaches significant weight to the connection between the controller’s non-compliance with Article 6 
GDPR and its failure to comply with the [IE SA]’s order. In our view, this warrants prompt intervention’

recalled the IE SA’s reasoning on the three-month deadline already provided by the IE SA its draft 
decision390 for compliance for the transparency infringements, which it considered to be necessary and 
proportionate in light of: (1) the potential for harms to the data subjects’ rights that such a measure 
entails, considering that the interim period for compliance ‘will involve a serious ongoing deprivation 
of  their  rights’,  (2)  the  significant  financial,  technological,  and  human  resources  and  (3)  the  clear 
instructions provided to Meta IE to comply with GDPR391. The EDPB therefore instructed the IE SA to 
include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing of personal data for the purpose 
of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook service into compliance with Article 6(1) 
GDPR within three months392.  

210.   Importantly, the understanding that the timeframe to be left to Meta IE to achieve compliance with 
the GDPR needed to be a fixed one was also shared by the IE SA in the IE SA Decisions, where the IE SA 
referred to the EDPB Binding Decisions and explained that clearly ‘the EDPB considered it necessary for 
[Meta IE]  to  take  the remedial action required  to  address  the relevant infringements ‘within three 
months’ and indicated a ‘need for urgent action’, and with ‘a fixed number of months’393.  

211.  The EDPB previously established that urgency procedures under Article 66 GDPR are derogations from 
the standard consistency and cooperation mechanism and that the requirements of Article 66 GDPR 
must be interpreted restrictively394. Therefore, the EDPB considers that it may request final measures 
under Article 66(2) GDPR only if the regular cooperation or consistency mechanisms cannot be applied 
in their usual manner  due to the urgency of the situation395. Therefore, the  EDPB assesses in this 
section  whether  there  is  a  need  to  derogate  from  the  regular  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanisms in this case. 

212.  In this particular case, the IE SA already adopted the IE SA Final Decisions under the one-stop-shop 
procedure on the basis of the EDPB Binding Decisions, containing an order for compliance with Article 
6(1)  GDPR.  Pursuant  to  Article  60(10)  GDPR,  the  controller  shall  notify  the  measures  taken  for 
complying with a decision taken in the cooperation mechanism with the LSA, which shall inform the 
CSAs.  

213.  The  EDPB  Guidelines  on  the  application  of  Article  60  GDPR  highlight  that  the  ‘obligation  [of  the 
controller to notify to the LSA the measures taken to comply with the decision] ensures the effectiveness 
of the enforcement. It is also the basis of possible necessary follow-up actions to be commenced by the 
LSA, also in cooperation with the other CSAs’396.  

214.  These guidelines further point out that if the LSA concludes that the measures taken are insufficient, 
the LSA should, as part of its legal duty to inform the CSAs, consider providing the other CSAs with its 
assessment of the measures adopted by the controller, in particular in order to decide whether further

actions  are  necessary397.This  indicates  that  where  the  measures  adopted  by  the  controller  are 
considered to be insufficient, there may be a need for the LSA to take further actions.  

215.  In  the  case  at  hand,  the  IE  SA  concluded  in  the  IE  SA  Final  Position  Paper,  also  relying  upon  the 
comments shared and views expressed by the CSAs, that Meta IE failed to demonstrate compliance 
with the IE SA Decisions398. However, it also considered that it was ‘fair’ and ‘reasonable’ to provide 
Meta IE with an opportunity to demonstrate that it can rely on consent as a lawful basis rather than 
engaging in enforcement measures399.  

216.  The IE SA has also reiterated its position, as LSA, that no further urgent actions are necessary in this 
case, as the course of action already being taken, consisting in ‘an enforcement procedure [...] in which 
a defined set of proposals, by which [Meta IE] proposes to achieve compliance with its obligations under 
Article 6 GDPR (and the terms of the [IE SA] Decisions), is the subject of ongoing assessment by the [IE 
SA] and the CSAs’, is adequately addressing the situation400.  

217.  In  this  respect,  the  EDPB  acknowledges  the  need  to  evaluate  the  proposal  being  made  by  the 
controller,  and  that  this  entails  the  ‘examination  of  a  number  of  particularly  complex  (and  novel) 
issues’401. The EDPB also fully acknowledges that a ‘regulatory process’ is ‘being conducted under the 
 
GDPR’s cooperation and consistency framework’, led by the IE SA,

he  EDPB  therefore  finds  that  the  existence  of  the  Meta  IE’s  Consent 
Proposal does not undermine the need to take actions to ensure that the unlawful processing comes 
to an end. 

219.  In this context, the EDPB notes that the IE SA acknowledged in its Final Position Paper - more than four 
months after the deadline for compliance - that Meta IE still infringes the GDPR405. The EDPB finds that 
the fact that the IE SA did not take supervisory measures to put an end to Meta IE’s inappropriate 
reliance on 6(1)(b) and 6(1)(f) GDPR and to enforce the IE SA Decisions, despite the risk of serious and

irreparable  harm  caused  to  data  subjects406,  shows  that  the  regular  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanism is not providing satisfactory results, and that there is a need to request the IE SA to urgently 
order final measures due to the urgency of the situation. In this respect, the EDPB notes that while 
now six months after the deadline for compliance have passed, there is still no clear indication that 
compliance will be reached soon nor is there a clear indication that the IE SA - as LSA - intends to adopt 
corrective measures in order to end the ongoing infringements407. 

220.  In  conclusion,  the  EDPB  finds,  in  light  of  the  circumstances  described  above,  that  the  regular 
cooperation or consistency mechanisms cannot be applied in their usual manner, and that due to 
the risk of serious and irreparable harm without urgent final measures, there is a need to derogate 
from the regular cooperation and consistency mechanisms to order final measures due to the urgency 
of the situation.  

221.  Lastly, the EDPB considers it relevant to recall the SAs’ duty to monitor the application of the GDPR in 
order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and 
to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the EU408. In particular, the EDPB has stated that 
when a violation of the GDPR has been established, competent supervisory authorities are required to 
react appropriately to remedy this infringement409. The powers afforded to SAs by Article 58 GDPR are 
aimed  to  fulfilling  this  goal.  Similarly,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  held  that  ‘(...) 
[a]lthough the supervisory authority must determine which action is appropriate and necessary (...), 
the supervisory authority is nevertheless required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the 
GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence’410.  

4.2.2  On the application of a legal presumption of urgency justifying the need to derogate 

from the cooperation and consistency mechanisms 

222.  In the precedent section, the EDPB found that there is a need to derogate from the regular cooperation 
and consistency mechanisms to order final measures due to the urgency of the situation411. In this 
section, the EDPB assesses whether such urgency and need to derogate from the regular cooperation 
and consistency mechanisms may also be presumed on the basis of Article 61(8) GDPR. 

223.  Considering the facts of the case412, the EDPB will assess whether this case falls within the description 
provided  by  Article  61(8)  GDPR,  which  refers  to  the  situation  where  an  SA  does  not  provide  the 
information  referred  to  in  Article  61(5)  GDPR  within  one  month  of  receiving  a  mutual  assistance 
request from another SA. Article 61(8) GDPR provides that the ‘urgent need to act under Article 66(1) 
[GDPR] shall be presumed to be met and require an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant 
to Article 66(2) [GDPR]’. If such a presumption applies, the urgent nature of an Article 66(2) request 
for an urgent binding decision can be presumed and does not need to be demonstrated413.

224.  As mentioned, the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request was made on 5 May 2023 - see paragraphs 10, 
13, and 15 above describing the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request and the response provided by the 
IE SA.  

4.2.2.1  Summary of the position of the NO SA 

225.  The NO SA considers that Article 61(8) GDPR is applicable in this case414 because the IE SA replied ‘No, 
I cannot comply with the request’ to the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request ‘without providing any 
specific justification other than referring to another letter it sent to all of the CSAs on 31 May 2023’415. 
The NO SA also argues that the ‘IE SA did not provide a reasoned refusal’ as per Article 61(4) GDPR, 
‘nor did it inform [the NO SA] of results or progress of any measures taken in order to respond to [their] 
request to ban the unlawful processing of personal data and to enforce compliance with Article 6(1) 
[GDPR]’416.  According  to  the  NO  SA,  the  content  of  the  letter  of  31  May  2023  was  a  simple 
announcement of when the IE SA would finalise its review of the Meta IE Compliance Reports, but it 
‘did not provide any information on the specific enforcement plan [they] requested, nor did it announce 
any specific or envisaged enforcement action with respect to Meta IE, despite [their] request to that 
effect’417. 

226.  In view of the NO SA there ‘were no measures taken in order to respond to the request’, and within a 
month from  the NO SA  Mutual Assistance request, ‘the IE SA  had complied with neither of [their] 
demands’418. The NO SA also indicates that their demands remain unfulfilled due to the fact that the 
IE SA considers it fair and reasonable not to engage in enforcement measures despite its conclusion 
that Meta IE is currently failing to rely on a valid lawful basis for behavioural advertising419. 

227.  To support the view that Article 61(8) GDPR is applicable to the present case, the NO SA refers to an 
opinion of Advocate General Bobek stating that where a LSA fails to address a CSA mutual assistance 
request, the latter may adopt provisional measures in circumstances in which ‘the urgent need to act 
is presumed and need not be proven’420. The NO SA also mentions the existence of precedent decisions 
applying the Article 61(8) GDPR presumption, in particular a decision from the IT SA related to Meta IE 
where the SA similarly considered that a failure from the LSA to address their request legitimately 
allowed  for  a  derogation  to  the  cooperation  mechanism  and  the  triggering  of  an  Article  66  GDPR 
urgency procedure421. 

228.  The NO SA underlines that - contrary to the factual circumstances that led the EDPB to conclude that 
Article 61(8) was not applicable in a previous case422 - ‘the communications regarding the present 
matter between the NO SA and the IE SA were made using the procedure for MA [Mutual Assistance]

the NO SA, in its Letter to the IE SA of 21 September 2023 (p.1), states they understand the IE SA has chosen not 
to follow the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request because in spite of preliminarily concluding that Meta IE is still 
not operating in compliance with Art. 6(1) GDPR they did not indicate any corresponding enforcement measures.

(“VM[A]”) requests’423. 

4.2.2.2  Summary of the position of the controller 

229.  Meta IE argues that, in this case, no ‘presumption of urgency arises under Article 61(8) GDPR’424. Meta 
IE indicates that in order to rely on Article 61(8) GDPR presumption of urgency, the NO SA ‘must show 
that the [IE SA] failed to respond to the [NO SA’s Mutual Assistance Request]’ but considers that the 
NO SA ‘cannot show this’425. Meta IE states that the NO SA’s ‘attempt to rely on the presumption of 
urgency in Article 61(8) GDPR is misconceived as a matter of law and contradicts the factual record of 
communications’ between the IE SA and the NO SA426. According to Meta IE, the IE SA ‘adequately 
addressed the [NO SA Mutual Assistance Request] by providing the information the [NO SA]requested’ 
and the NO SA ‘distort[s] and mischaracterize[s] the substance and nature of the correspondence’ with 
the IE SA427. 

230.  In Meta IE’s view, the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request did not ‘request the [IE SA] to detail a “specific 
enforcement plan” or “specific or envisaged enforcement action” that it would “impose on [Meta IE] in 
the event of non-compliance”, as this is not what is entailed by the request of the NO SA to the IE SA 
to share “a timeline specifying how it will ensure in an expedient manner that Meta [IE] complies with 
Article 6(1) GDPR”’428. Rather, according to Meta IE, this wording referred to a request to share a 
timeline, which the IE SA provided ‘on numerous occasions’429 and this demonstrates that there was 
‘no inaction or failure to communicate by the [IE SA] which the [NO SA] can now rely on to invoke Article 
61(8) [GDPR]’430. 

231.  According to Meta IE, ‘the [IE SA]’s decision not to immediately implement the [NO SA]’s own preferred 
enforcement  measures  did  not  amount  to  a  failure  to  adequately  respond  to  the  [NO  SA  Mutual 
Assistance Request]. Nothing in Article 61(1) GDPR requires such blind obedience by an LSA to whatever 
actions  a  CSA  might  request  it  to  take.  [...]  The  [IE  SA]  adequately  addressed  the  [NO  SA  Mutual 
Assistance Request] by providing the information the [NO SA] requested’431. It also states that ‘Article 
61(5)  GDPR  [...]  does  not  require  an  LSA  to  commit  in  advance  to  impose  any  specific  corrective 
measures within any specific timeframe’432. Meta IE further elaborates that while ‘Article 61 GDPR 
cannot  be  used  by  a  single  SA  to  demand  that  an  LSA  adopt  corrective  measures  with  respect  to 
processing  that  is  subject  to  an  ongoing  LSA-led  compliance  proceeding’,  the  IE  SA  later  provided 
reasons ‘for declining to issue an immediate ban on processing’433. In this regard, Meta IE is of the 
opinion that corrective measures cannot be requested ‘with respect to processing that is subject to an 
ongoing LSA-led compliance proceeding’ as this could ‘undermine the one-stop shop mechanism and

the LSA’s duty to consider all CSAs views in connection with that mechanism’434. In addition, Meta IE 
argues that the request ban on processing had already been ‘considered and rejected by the EDPB in a 
prior Article 65 GDPR binding decision’435.  

232.  In Meta IE’s view, the IE SA addressed the NO SA’s Mutual Assistance Request via the IE SA Update to 
CSAs of 31 May 2023as it contained ‘relevant information’ and allowed to inform the NO SA of ‘the 
progress of the measures taken in order to’ address the request436. Considering that the IE SA did 
address the request on 31 May 2023, it therefore did not refuse to do so when it provided its negative 
response on IMI on 2 June 2023 because this response was accompanied with a reference to the IE SA 
Update  to  CSAs  of  31  May  2023437.  Meta  IE  further  details  that  the  IE  SA  had  explained  that  the 
negative response on IMI was the result of a ‘mistake’ and that the NO SA’s message to the IE SA shows 
that the NO SA ‘did not believe [...] that the [IE SA] had failed to respond’ to the request438. In support 
of this, Meta IE mentions a message from the NO SA to the IE SA stating: ‘Thank you for your message 
of 2 June 2023. We understand that you will revert towards the end of June’ and ‘we will await your 
response towards the end of June’439.  

233.  Meta IE considers that the NO SA did not object to the IE SA Provisional Position Paper and did not 
mention any alleged failure by the IE SA to respond to the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request, ‘despite 
invoking Article 61(8) GDPR in the [NO SA] Order to attempt to argue that urgency may be presumed 
due to an alleged failure to respond by the [IE SA]’440. Furthermore, Meta IE argues that the NO SA ‘did 
not raise any complaints about the [IE SA]’s proposed timetable prior to issuing the Order, even though 
that is what it would have been expected to do first if it had genuine concerns about urgency’441. 

234.  Concerning the NO SA’s reference to the opinion of Advocate General Bobek in Case C-645/19, Meta 
IE indicates that ‘considering the lengthy procedural history, which includes the [IE SA] imposing the 
NOYB  Decisions  and  properly  conducting  an  ongoing  compliance  procedure,  the  NO  SA  cannot 
reasonably argue that the [IE SA] has failed to act. The [IE SA] is acting, and also fully cooperating with, 
the other SAs’442. 

4.2.2.3  Analysis of the EDPB 

235.  The cooperation mechanism in the GDPR provides for different tools for the SAs to exchange among 
themselves and perform their tasks. One of such tools is mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 
GDPR.  Under  this  provision,  SAs  ‘shall  provide  each  other  with  relevant  information  and  mutual 
assistance in order to implement and apply [the GDPR] in a consistent manner, and shall put in place

measures for effective cooperation with one another’443. The same provision also explains that mutual 
assistance ‘shall cover, in particular, information requests and supervisory measures, such as requests 
to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations’ 444.   

236.  The EDPB recalls that Article 61 GDPR on mutual assistance belongs to Section 1 of Chapter VII of the 
GDPR related to cooperation. In this regard, the EDPB considers Article 61 GDPR to be one of the 
mechanisms for supervisory authorities to ensure proper and efficient cooperation. Consequently, the 
concept of mutual assistance rooted in the GDPR entails ‘sincere and effective cooperation’445 and 
requires  concrete  actions  from  a  supervisory  authority  receiving  a  mutual  assistance  request 
(hereinafter, ‘Requested SA’). More specifically, the obligations of a Requested SA can be listed in a 
logical sequence as follows:  

•  Article 61(2) GDPR: ‘each SA shall take all appropriate measures required to reply to a request 

of another SA’; 

•  Article 61(2) GDPR: the Requested SA shall reply within a specific timeframe (‘without undue 

delay and no later than one month after receiving the request’); 

•  Article 61(4) GDPR: the Requested SA must ‘comply with the request’ in all cases except for the 

situations mentioned in Article 61(4) (a) and (b); 

•  Article 61(5) GDPR, first sentence: ‘the requested SA shall inform the requesting SA of the result 
or,  as  the  case  may  be,  of  the  progress  of  the  measures  taken  in  order  to  respond  to  the 
request’; 

•  Article 61(5) GDPR, second sentence: ‘the requested SA shall provide reasons for any refusal to 

comply with a request pursuant to paragraph 4’; 

•  Article 61(6) GDPR: the Requested SA shall, as a rule, supply the information by electronic 

means, using a standardised format.  

237.  Article  61(9)  GDPR  provides  the  possibility  for  the  European  Commission  (hereinafter  the  ‘EC’)  to 
specify, by means of implementing acts, the format and procedures for mutual assistance and the 
arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between SAs. On 16 May 2018, the 
EC adopted an implementing act relating to the use of the EC Internal Market Information system for 
GDPR  consistency  and  cooperation  procedures,  including  for  Article  61  GDPR  mutual  assistance 
requests (IMI) (hereinafter, the ‘IMI Implementing Act’)446.  

238.  The IMI procedure dedicated to Article 61 GDPR mutual assistance requests is a one-to-one workflow. 
This entails that the request can only be addressed to, and received by, the Requested SA. Similarly, 
the reply will only be addressed to, and received by, the SA that made the mutual assistance request 
(hereinafter, the ‘Requesting SA’). Pursuant to Article 3(3) of the IMI Implementing Act, this dedicated 
workflow is to be used for the different exchanges between authorities in the framework of an Article

61 GDPR mutual assistance request. This includes, in particular, ‘requesting mutual assistance from 
another supervisory authority in the form of information and/or supervisory measures’, ‘responding to 
a mutual assistance request including acceptance or in exceptional cases refusals to comply with the 
request’, and ‘communication of the progress and the result of measures taken in order to respond to 
the request’447. The use of this dedicated IMI workflow also allows for the automatic monitoring of the 
one-month deadline to reply to a request pursuant to Article 61(2) GDPR. 

239.  Being a one-to-one workflow in the IMI, an Article 61 GDPR mutual assistance procedure is a type of 
bilateral  communication  to  be  distinguished  from  other  bilateral  or  multilateral  communication 
channels that are made available in IMI for other types of GDPR cooperation mechanisms. While a 
mutual  assistance  request  can  be  connected  to  developments  occurring  within  multilateral 
communication  channels,  the  initiation  of  a  mutual  assistance  request  by  a  supervisory  authority 
opens a dedicated workflow for exchanges between the Requesting and Requested SAs only.  

240.  Pursuant to Article 61 GDPR, a Requested SA is under a legal obligation to address a mutual assistance 
request. The only possibility for a Requested SA to refuse to address a request is where it provides 
reasons for refusing to comply, in line with the two limited exceptions of Article 61(4) GDPR448 and as 
provided in the last sentence of Article 61(5) GDPR449. While the possibility to provide information on 
the results or progress of the measures taken within the one-month timeframe gives some discretion 
to the Requested SA, the duty to cooperate also implies that the Requested SA must always take 
certain  concrete  steps  to  address  the  given  request,  or  duly  justify  why  it  does  not  do  so.  In  an 
exceptional  situation  where  a  Requested  SA  does  not  provide  appropriate  information  on  the 
measures taken, the progress made, or on the duly reasoned grounds why it cannot satisfy the request, 
within one month of receiving the request, the Requesting SA may consider that the conditions of 
Article 61(8) GDPR are met. 

241.  In light of the above developments, the EDPB considers that the obligation for the Requested SA to 

address a mutual assistance request implies the need to fulfil procedural and substantive criteria.  

242.  The need to fulfil the procedural criteria mainly derives from Article 61, paragraphs 6 and 9 GDPR, 
together with Article 3(3) of the IMI Implementing Act. The procedural criteria relate to the procedural 
formalities that need to be respected to address a mutual assistance request.    

243.  For what concerns, on the other hand, the obligation to fulfil substantive criteria, the EDPB considers 
that this arises from the provisions mentioned above, namely (i) the wording of Article 61(4) GDPR and 
Article 61 (5) GDPR, providing for a possibility to refuse to comply with mutual assistance requests only 
based on the limited grounds listed in the GDPR,  and providing reasons for any refusal, and (ii) the 
qualification of mutual assistance as a tool for cooperation. This imposes the need to examine the 
content of the reply and the actions taken by a Requested SA to evaluate whether or not a given 
request has been addressed.  

244.  The list provided by Article 61(1) GDPR is not exhaustive (‘in particular’). As such, it does not list or 
exclude specifically the imposition of corrective measures. However, the EDPB considers that this does 

                                                            
447 EC Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/743 of 16 May 2018, Article 3(3). 
448Art. 61(4) GDPR states ‘The requested supervisory authority shall not refuse to comply with the request unless: 
(a) it is not competent for the subject-matter of the request or for the measures it is requested to execute; or (b) 
compliance  with  the  request  would  infringe  this  Regulation  or  Union  or  Member  State  law  to  which  the 
supervisory authority receiving the request is subject.’ 
449 ‘The requested supervisory authority shall provide reasons for any refusal to comply with a request pursuant 
to paragraph 4’.

not, in any event, remove the duty of the Requested SA, pursuant to Article 61 (4) and 61 (5) GDPR 
and the general duty of cooperation, to provide reasons for any refusal to comply with a request. 

245.  Moving on to the case at hand, the EDPB notes that on 5 May 2023 a formal Article 61 GDPR mutual 
assistance request was initiated by the NO SA via the creation of a dedicated IMI workflow. The NO SA 
Mutual Assistance Request contained two different requests:  

(i)  ‘that  the  IE  SA  issues  a  temporary  ban  on  Meta  IE’s  processing  of  personal  data  for 
behavioural advertising purposes on Facebook and Instagram based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, in 
accordance with Article 58(2)(f) GDPR’450; 

(ii) ‘that the IE SA shares a timeline specifying how it will ensure in an expedient manner that 
[Meta IE] complies with Article 6(1) GDPR’. 

246.  In the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request, the NO SA also specified that they would ‘be grateful if the 
IE SA, by 5 June 2023, would share the timeline and confirm that a temporary ban will be issued’ and 
that ‘If the IE SA is not in a position to comply with our request regarding [Meta IE], we may need to 
consider our options in relation to the adoption of provisional measures in Norway pursuant to Article 
66 of the GDPR. We hope that this will not be necessary and look forward to cooperating further with 
the IE SA within the framework of the cooperation mechanisms set out in Chapter VII of the GDPR’.  

247.  The NO SA Mutual Assistance Request was also uploaded by the NO SA as a comment on the Meta IE 
Compliance Reports, shared with the LSA and all CSAs within the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations. 
Other CSAs shared their feedback on the Compliance Reports in the same period, as described above 
in paragraph 10, and some of them also addressed concerns on actions taken by the IE SA451. In this 
context, on 30 May 2023, the NL SA also made a mutual assistance request, as described above in 
paragraph 12. Analysing, first of all, whether the procedural criteria were met by the IE SA’s response 
to  the  NO  SA  Mutual  Assistance  Request,  the  EDPB  notes  that  it  is  on  2  June  2023  that  the  first 
                                                            
450 The wording of the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request then goes on as follows: ‘The ban should last until the 
lead and concerned supervisory authorities are satisfied that [Meta IE] has provided adequate and sufficient 
commitments to ensure compliance with Articles 6(1) and 21 GDPR, in line with Article 31 GDPR. This will give us 
the opportunity to further engage with Meta and make sure that it commits to fully respect its obligations under 
the  GDPR,  while  preventing  any  further  risks  for  data  subjects  stemming  from  [Meta  IE]’s  non-compliant 
behavioural advertising practices. Please note that in our view, behavioural advertising includes any activities 
where advertising is targeted on the basis of a data subject’s behaviour or movements, including advertising 
based on perceived location’.  
451 Several CSAs expressed concerns about: 
(i) The IE SA not sharing its own legal assessment (e.g. FR SA on 25 April 2023; DE Hamburg SA on 4 May 2023). 
In response, the IE SA invited the CSAs to ‘carry out their own assessments of the compliance material’ and 
outlined that ‘the finding of infringement of Article 6(1) [GDPR] and the requirement for a corresponding order 
to be imposed, were determined by the EDPB’ which ’overturned the views originally expressed by the IE SA in its 
draft decision‘ (IE SA request for CSAs views circulated via the IMI on 26 April 2023);  
(ii) The measures suggested by the controller to comply with the IE SA decisions - in particular the reliance on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR for behavioural advertising - which raised concerns and criticisms 
for which several CSAs requested immediate actions from the IE SA  (e.g. views of DE Hamburg SA on 4 May 2023; 
views of NL SA on 4 May 2023; comment of the SE SA on 4 May 2023). 
Similarly, the NO SA had previously contacted the IE SA via email on 5 April to express their ‘strong doubts’ about 
Meta using Article 6(1)(f) in the context of behavioural advertising, as well as their fear of a ‘real risk to data 
subject's rights’, and asking the IE SA for their assessment and intentions for regulatory action. On 4 May 2023, 
the IE SA had indicated via the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations that they would ‘not be preparing any further 
decision in this matter’ and that they would rely on their assessment of compliance, carried out jointly together 
with all CSAs, IE SA Information on Procedure (response to SE SA), dated 4 May 2023.

procedural development from the IE SA occurred within the Art. 61 IMI workflow initiated by the NO 
SA. This is when the IE SA specified they ‘cannot comply with the request’ (by way of checking a pre-
filled text box on IMI), and indicated in a comment they had further detailed their response under 
previous communications located in the IMI Informal Consultations452. The IE SA made reference to 
the IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 (see above paragraph 13). Therefore, the EDPB considers 
that the IE SA addressed the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request from a procedural standpoint.  

248.  The EDPB also analyses the substance of the reply provided by the IE SA to assess whether the NO SA 
Mutual Assistance Request was addressed within the one-month deadline set by the legislator. It is in 
particular relevant to assess whether the IE SA, refusing to comply with the NO SA Mutual Assistance 
Request, provided the reasons for such refusal in accordance with Article 61(5) GDPR. While specifying 
they ‘cannot comply with the request’, the IE SA indicated in a comment they had further detailed their 
response under previous communications located in the IE SA IMI Informal Consultations453. The IE SA 
made reference to the IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 (see above paragraph 13)454. 

249.  According to the IE SA, the IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 which its reply of 2 June 2023 referred 
to was ‘directed to the subject matter of the NO SA [Mutual Assistance Request]’ and was ‘clearly 
engaging with the substance of the NO SA [Mutual Assistance Request] [...] directly, and in a fulsome 
manner’455. Consequently, the IE SA considers it did not refuse to engage with the NO SA’s request for 
mutual assistance by means of its communication of 2 June 2023456.  

250.  The  content  of  the  IE  SA  Update  to  CSAs  of  31  May  2023  relates  to  the  information  about  the 
continuation of the assessment of the Meta IE Compliance Reports pursuant to Article 60(10) GDPR457. 
In fact, it was a mere confirmation of the approach already suggested to all CSAs prior to the NO SA 
Mutual Assistance Request458.

453 More specifically the message from the IE SA stated: ‘Dear Colleagues, Please see detailed response uploaded 
by the [IE SA] under [the IMI Informal Consultations] for further information. Best regards, IE SA’.  
Such response was the IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 (see paragraph 13 above). The LSA referred to two 
different communications issued to all CSAs via the IMI Informal Consultations.  
454 The IE SA indicated that they had ‘received all of the assessments from CSAs’ and ‘forwarded them to [Meta 
IE] for it to consider the views expressed and to detail any changes that it proposes to implement on foot of the 
CSA  assessments’.  Furthermore,  the  IE  SA  stated  that  it  will  ‘complete  its  own  assessment  of  [Meta  IE]’s 
compliance reports’ ‘once the IE SA receives [Meta IE]’s response’. The IE SA also stated ‘it will be in a position to 
complete its own assessment of [Meta IE]’s [Compliance Reports] and to share its assessment with the Norwegian 
and Dutch supervisory authorities (both of which have lodged Article 61 requests for mutual assistance) and with 
all other CSAs by the end of June 2023‘.

457 The LSA indicated that they had ‘received all of the assessments from CSAs’ and ‘forwarded them to [Meta IE]

458 IE SA Information on Procedure (response to SE SA), dated 4 May 2023 (prior to the NO SA Mutual Assistance

SA will not be preparing any further decision in this matter’ and that they would rely on their assessment of 
compliance, carried out jointly together with all CSAs.

251.  The EDPB notes that the IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 makes reference to the NO SA Mutual 
Assistance Request, by saying: ‘The IE SA anticipates that it will be in a position to complete its own 
assessment of Meta IE Compliance Reports and to share its assessment with the [NO SA] and [NL SA] 
(both of which have lodged Article 61 requests for mutual assistance) and with all other CSAs by the 
end of June 2023’.  

252.  However, the EDPB considers that:  

• 

• 

the second request in the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request was a request for ‘a timeline 
specifying how [the IE SA] will ensure in an expedient manner that [Meta IE] complies with 
Article 6(1) GDPR’. The IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 does provide a timeline of the 
next steps in the process envisaged by the IE SA for the assessment of the Meta IE Compliance 
Reports (with the last step being the completion of the IE SA’s own assessment and its sharing 
with the CSAs by the end of June 2023). However, there are no details as to how the IE SA 
considered that the completion of the assessment of the Compliance Reports would ‘ensure 
in an expedient manner that [Meta IE] complies with Article 6(1) GDPR’. While there is an 
implicit (and, in any event, only partial) connection, further motivation in this regard would 
have been necessary.  
the first request in the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request was a request for the imposition of 
a “temporary ban on Meta’s processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes 
on Facebook and Instagram based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, in accordance with Article 58(2)(f) 
GDPR’. The IE SA Update to CSAs of 31 May 2023 does not include any reasoning as to the IE 
SA’s acknowledgement or consideration of this request.  

253.  The EDPB notes that while the IE SA explained after the expiry of the one-month deadline that the 
negative answer to  the NO SA  Mutual Assistance Request was the result of  a mistake (a  text box 
‘incorrectly (and inadvertently) checked’)459, the IE SA does not state it tried to amend its answer - for 
instance to provide the reasons for any refusal to comply with the request - or sought assistance to do 
so within the one-month deadline.  

254.   The EDPB also takes note of the IE SA’s view shared on 27 September 2023 that the part of the NO SA 
Mutual Assistance Request pertaining to a ban was not ‘validly made by reference to the provisions of 
Article 61 GDPR’ and that it was not ‘open to the [NO SA] to demand, by way of mutual assistance 
request, that the [IE SA] impose a temporary ban on the Processing Operations’ at stake460.  

255.  However, Article 61(4), letter (b) GDPR envisages the possibility for the Requested SA to refuse to 
comply with a mutual assistance request in a situation where it considers that compliance with it would 
infringe the GDPR or EU or Member State law to which the Requested SA is subject. Nevertheless, in 
this circumstance, as already underlined under paragraph 240, the Requested SA that wishes to invoke 
this ground for refusal needs to motivate its response pursuant to Article 61(5) GDPR. The IE SA Update 
to CSAs of 31 May 2023 or the message in the MA Request workflow of 2 June 2023 do not provide 
any justification for not addressing the request under the limited exceptions of Article 61(4) GDPR. In 
addition, the views shared on 27 September 2023 were way beyond the expiration of the one month

460 Letter from the IE SA to the NO SA dated 27 September 2023, p. 3. In this regard the IE SA further argued that 
the EDPB Binding Decisions ‘explicitly declined to impose a temporary ban’ (p. 3) and that ‘Putting in place an 
immediate ban on processing which is isolated and divorced from any underlying legal procedure would inevitably 
expose the [IE SA] to significant legal risk and lead to litigation’ (p. 4).

deadline. Therefore, the EDPB considers that, within one month of receiving the request, the LSA did 
not provide the reasons for refusal to comply with the request pursuant to Article 61(5) GDPR.  

256.  In light of the above, the EDPB considers that the IE SA failed to provide a substantive reply the NO SA 

Mutual Assistance Request. 

257.  Considering the fact that Article 61(8) GDPR provides explicitly that the presumption of urgency applies 
in case the [Requested SA] does not provide the information in [Article 61(5)] within the one month of 
receiving the request, the EDPB therefore considers that the presumption set by Article 61(8) GDPR 
is applicable in this specific case. Consequently, the EDPB finds that urgency may be presumed on 
the basis of Article 61(8) GDPR, which further corroborates the need to derogate from the regular 
cooperation and consistency mechanisms 461. 

4.2.3  Conclusion as to the existence of urgency  

258.  The EDPB considers that the elements analysed above justify the urgency for the EDPB to request the 
IE SA to order final measures under Article 66(2) GDPR. The EDPB considers that the urgent need to 
order final measures is clear in light of the risks that the infringements represent for the rights and 
freedoms  of  the  data  subjects  without  the  adoption  of  final  measures462.  Furthermore,  the  EDPB 
considers that such urgency may be presumed pursuant to Article 61(8) GDPR463. The EDPB therefore 
considers that there is urgency for the IE SA to order final measures in this case.  

5  ON THE APPROPRIATE FINAL MEASURES 

259.  On the basis of the analysis above (see sections 4.1 and 4.2), the conditions relating to the existence 
of infringements and to an urgent need to act in this case are met. The EDPB therefore proceeds with 
the analysis of which final measures, if any, it should order in this specific case. A request from a SA 
under Article 66(2) GDPR is aimed to address a situation where such SA, after adopting provisional 
measures under Article 66(1) GDPR, ‘considers that final measures need urgently be adopted’.  

5.1  Content of the final measures 

5.1.1  Summary of the position of the NO SA 

260.  In the NO SA Request to the EDPB, the NO SA requests that ‘final measures, in line with the provisional 
measures [the NO SA] imposed in Norway, be imminently adopted’464. In the NO SA Order, the NO SA 
prohibited for three months Meta IE and Facebook Norway from processing personal data of data 
subjects residing in Norway for behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Article 
6(1)(f) GDPR from 4 August 2023 to 3 November 2023465. The NO SA provides that the NO SA Order 
will be lifted before that date if remedial measures are implemented so that adequate and sufficient 
commitments to ensure compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 21 GDPR can be provided466. In 
case the order is not complied with, the NO SA announces, in the NO SA Order itself, that it may decide 
to  impose  a  coercive  fine  of  up  to  NOK  1  000  000  per  day  of  non-compliance  on  Meta  IE  and/or

Facebook Norway, individually or collectively467. As Meta IE and Facebook Norway did not comply with 
the NO SA Order, the NO SA imposed a daily coercive fine, which started to accrue on 14 August 
2023468.  

261.  The NO SA also points out that, with respect to the objective that the final measures should seek to 
achieve,  ‘it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  “[p]ersonal  data  shall  not  be  processed  for  Behavioural 
Advertising based on Article 6(1)(b) [GDPR] or [Article] 6(1)(f) GDPR in the context of the Services”’469. 
The NO SA requests that any final measure should demand “swift compliance” without further delay470. 

262.  With respect to the geographical scope of the final measures requested, the NO SA asked that ‘the 
measures should be applied EEA-wide, to avoid derogating from the harmonisation and consistency 
that the GDPR aims to ensure’471.  

263.  The  NO  SA  considers  that  Meta  IE  has  a  ‘readily  available  procedure  to  terminate  this  processing 
rapidly’, as it already implemented an objection mechanism in the EEA in relation to its processing for 
behavioural  advertising  in  reliance  of  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR.  In  other  words,  the  NO  SA  argues  that 
suspending this processing activity could be achieved through the use of a process similar to the one 
used  by  Meta  IE  in  the  context  of  the  objection  mechanism,  and  that  nothing  -  from  a  technical 
perspective - prevents Meta IE from suspending the behavioural advertising processing in the EEA472.  

264.  To support this request, the NO SA points out that (1) final measures should urgently be adopted 
because the processing of personal data violates the rights and freedoms of data subjects in all EEA 
states, (2) the IE SA Decisions are applicable for users in all EEA states, and (3) there is consensus at 
European level between the IE SA and the CSAs that the processing continues to be unlawful473. 

5.1.2  Summary of the position of Meta IE and Facebook Norway  

265.  Meta IE points out that in its view ‘it is not clear which final measures the [NO SA] is seeking to request 
from  the  EDPB’474.  According  to  Meta  IE,  the  NO  SA  Order  ‘comprises  three  core  elements:  (i)  the 
imposition of a temporary ban [...]; (ii) the imposition of daily administrative fines [...]; and (iii) the 
lifting of that ban subject to receiving adequate commitments from [Meta IE]’ 475. Meta IE alleges it is 
not  clear  whether  the  NO  SA  intends  to  pursue  each  of  these  elements,  or  others,  as  part  of  its 
request476. 

266.  Meta IE considers that the NO SA Request to the EDPB constitutes partly ‘an attempt to re-litigate 
objections that the [NO SA] has already raised in the NOYB Inquiries at the Article 65 GDPR stage and 
which have already been rejected by the EDPB’477. According to Meta IE, the NO SA’s actions ‘appear 
to be motivated by (unwarranted) dissatisfaction with the [IE SA]’s handling of the enforcement of the

NOYB Decisions’. The controller states then that it ‘cannot be sanctioned based on factors that are 
outside its sphere of influence’478.  

267.  In addition, Meta IE provided arguments in respect of the possible content of the final measures to be 
ordered by the EDPB, setting out elements for each possible measure identified. Meta IE also argues 
that, in general, only the provisional measures adopted by the requesting SA can be adopted as final 
measures under the Article 66(2) GDPR procedure479. In Meta IE’s view, it is unclear whether the EDPB 
is competent to order final measures on an EEA-wide basis, or whether it is limited to only ordering 
measures with respect to the country of the requesting CSA, and it is unclear whether the EDPB is 
competent to adopt final measures permanently480. On this matter, Meta IE also made reference to 
the fact that the EDPB has itself requested the EU legislator to clarify this481. 

268.  Regarding a possible deletion order for data already unlawfully collected 

 
 while the NO SA has not explicitly requested such final measure, Meta 
IE clarified its view that such request would be unlawful and unnecessary482. More specifically, Meta 
IE argues that the  NO SA  Order  did  not issue a deletion order as part of its  Provisional Measures 
adopted  under  Article  66(1)  GDPR483.  Further,  Meta  IE  highlights  that  the  EDPB  Binding  Decisions 
 
rejected objections from the NO SA that aimed to impose a deletion order on Meta IE484. 
 
 
 
 
 
487. In any event, Meta IE notes that the personal data previously collected for 
behavioural advertising is also processed for other purposes that are not related to advertising, such 
as security, fraud and safety488. Meta IE considers that ‘a controller cannot be compelled to delete 
personal data where it is validly collected and processed for different purposes pursuant to valid legal 
bases, even in cases where its legal basis for one distinct set of processing is subsequently held to be 
invalid’489.

269.  Regarding a possible suspension order or ban applicable to all EEA users, Meta IE considers that the 
NO SA’s request for a short implementation deadline is allegedly ‘flawed and not feasible’490. According 
to Meta IE, building the supporting infrastructure and rolling out the objection mechanism entailed 
‘hundreds  of  thousands  of  hours  of  work’  on  Meta  IE’s  side  by  multi-disciplinary  teams  including 
product, machine learning and infrastructure engineers, user experience designers, operations, policy, 
marketing  and  legal  to  design,  build  and  implement  the  systems,  processes  and  user  experience 
required to enable Meta IE to meet the different requirements of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR491. In Meta IE’s 
view, the NO SA’s assertion that implementing a process similar to the objection mechanism could 
form some ‘sort of instant compliance solution’ is ‘flawed’492. 
 
 
493.  In  other 
 

words, Meta IE argues that a change of legal basis for its behavioural advertising processing before 

would simply not be feasible.  

270.  Meta  IE  also  quotes  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  IE  SA  in  that  regard:  ‘Putting  in  place  an 
immediate ban on processing which is isolated and divorced from any underlying legal procedure (...), 
would inevitably expose the [IE SA] to significant legal risk and lead to litigation. In the context of such 
litigation, the [IE SA] would be called on to justify its decision to depart from the course of action rooted 
in [IE SA Decisions] (uncontested by the EDPB and/or the CSAs), in favour of an alternative, summary 
procedure involving the immediate imposition of a ban on processing’494. 

271.  Regarding fines specifically, Meta IE argues that the NO SA is not entitled to ask for a fine as a final 
measure495, since the NO SA Order did not include fines as a provisional measure under Article 66(1) 
GDPR. More generally, Meta IE also claims that fines are not an appropriate form of final measures 
under Article 66(2) GDPR496, and that the EDPB is not competent to adopt such a decision under Article 
66(2)  GDPR497.  As  the  Article  66(2)  GDPR  procedure  constitutes  a  derogation  to  the  standard 
cooperation procedure, Meta IE, highlighting the need for a restrictive interpretation of Article 66 
GDPR, is of the opinion that any final measures ‘can only be those that are urgently needed to bring 
the infringement to an end’498. According to Meta IE, all the final measures that do not achieve this 
objective  must  be  adopted  within  the  framework  of  the  one-stop-shop  and  the  consistency 
mechanism499. Lastly, in Meta IE’s view, fines are not appropriate to ensure the immediate protection 
of data subjects500. Meta IE also argues that fines would be inappropriate in the circumstances of this 
case, where high fines have already been imposed by the IE SA in the IE SA Decisions and where Meta 
 engaged in good faith with the IE SA501.

According to Meta IE, the 
NO  SA  Request  to  the  EDPB  ‘already  has,  and  will  continue  to,  generate  a  huge  amount  of 
administrative work for the EDPB, the CSAs, the LSA and Meta [IE], 
 
 
502. Meta IE considers that, in light of the fact that a potential urgent binding decision may 
extend beyond Norway, ‘any attempt to perpetuate the provisions of the [NO SA] Order by way of such 
a decision only serves to exacerbate this misuse of the urgency procedure and the violation of [Meta 
IE]’s rights’503. 

272.  Facebook Norway highlights that it is not, and has never been, a party to the inquiries leading to the 
adoption of the IE SA Decisions504. It also highlights that the IE SA Decisions are only addressed to Meta 
IE, in its capacity of sole data controller for the purpose of behavioural advertising on Facebook and 
Instagram. Facebook Norway points out that it is a separate and independent legal entity that does 
not offer Facebook or Instagram either in Norway or elsewhere, and is not the data controller for the 
concerned  behavioural  advertising processing505.  Furthermore,  Facebook  Norway  maintains  that  it 
should not have been the addressee of the NO SA Order506. 

273.  Meta IE and  Facebook  Norway have also expressed the view that the  IE SA  has already  exercised 
corrective  powers  against  Meta  IE  in  the  IE  SA  Decisions,  and  that  anyways  the  enforcement  of 
corrective orders is a matter for the LSA and governed by the applicable national law507.  

5.1.3  Analysis of the EDPB  

274.  In  addition  to  the  elements  enshrined  in  the  NO  SA  Request  to  the  EDPB,  the  EDPB  takes  into 
consideration the elements and arguments put forward by the IE SA. The IE SA considers that the NO 
SA Request to the EDPB seeks to obtain an urgent binding decision from the EDPB, ‘the net effect of 
which would be to compel the [IE SA], as LSA, to impose an EEA-wide ban’508. However, according to 
the IE SA, it is already leading an ongoing ‘enforcement procedure’, whereby it is, along with the CSAs, 
assessing ‘a defined set of proposals, by which [Meta IE] proposes to achieve compliance’ with Article 
6(1) GDPR and the IE SA Decisions509. This process is happening by involving the CSAs in accordance 
with the GDPR’s cooperation and consistency framework510. More specifically, the IE SA highlights that 
it ‘is currently engaged in a cooperative process to give effect to these orders in a manner that permits 
all CSAs to make observations on [Meta IE]’s proposed course of action’511.

275.   According to the IE SA, no final measures ordered by the EDPB would be appropriate, as it would divert 
resources from the IE SA-led process under the GDPR’s cooperation and consistency framework512. In 
addition, according to the IE SA, the NO SA’s legal justifications to suggest immediate enforcement 
action by the LSA are ‘rooted in hypothetical arguments’513.  

276.  In this regard, the EDPB acknowledges that, since the moment the IE SA shared with the CSAs the  
Compliance Reports on 5 April 2023, there has been an ongoing process consisting in the assessment 
of the compliance efforts by Meta IE represented by the switch on 3 April 2023 to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 
as legal basis for most of the personal data collected on Meta’s products for behavioural advertising 
purposes and later on, by the Meta IE’s Consent Proposal, and that this process was led by the IE SA in 
its role as LSA in cooperation with the CSAs, which were invited to submit their views on multiple 
occasions.  

277.  However, in light of the elements described above, namely the existence of ongoing infringements of 
Article 6(1) GDPR - that the EDPB has already labelled as a ‘very serious situation of non-compliance’514, 
and of the duty to comply with decisions of SAs, and the existence of an urgent need to act despite the 
ongoing process led by the IE SA, as motivated above in Section 4.2 of this urgent binding decision, the 
EDPB  considers  that,  at  this  point  of  time,  there  is  a  need  to  order  final  measures  as  further 
enforcement measures are necessary.   

278.  With respect to the possible content of the specific final measures, the EDPB considers that it can 
order final measures other than the provisional measures adopted under Article 66(1) GDPR or than 
those referred to in the request made pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR. The GDPR does not indeed 
provide  such  limitations  on  the  final  measures,  and  the  EDPB, while  taking  into  consideration  the 
request made pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR as well the other elements of the file, is entrusted to 
ensure  the  correct  and  consistent  application  of  GDPR  when  performing  activities  under  the 
consistency mechanism515. Therefore, the EDPB is competent under Article 66(2) GDPR to order the 
final measures that are appropriate on the basis of the circumstances of the case.  

279.  In the case at hand, the EDPB considers it appropriate to analyse whether a ban on processing should 
be imposed, bearing in mind that the NO SA Request to the EDPB asks that ‘final measures, in line with 
the provisional measures [the NO SA] imposed in Norway, be imminently adopted’516, and that the NO 
SA Order included a prohibition from processing personal data of data subjects residing in Norway for 
behavioural advertising on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.  

280.  In respect of the possible imposition of a ban on processing, the IE SA considers that ‘the form of order 
sought by the [NO SA] is not one that could lawfully be delivered by the [IE SA] in the manner now 
demanded’517. This is, first, because the EDPB declined to instruct the IE SA to impose a temporary ban

in  the  EDPB  Binding  Decisions518,  and  secondly  because  the  IE  SA  Decisions  ‘made  provision  for 
enforcement measures, namely, the orders for compliance, under which [Meta IE]’s proposals for the 
adoption of one or more alternative legal bases for the Processing Operations would be assessed, and 
ruled on, on their respective merits’ 519. The IE SA concludes that ‘the EDPB recognised, explicitly, that 
a process would need to be put in place in which the Controller would identify the means by which it 
proposed to achieve compliance with its obligations, and, further, that, acting together in the context 
of the co-operation and consistency mechanism provided for at Chapter VII of the GDPR, the  [IE SA] 
and the CSAs would in turn be required to test those proposals and assess whether or not they are 
sufficient  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Article  6(1)  [GDPR]  and  the  [IE  SA] 
Decisions’520. 

281.  According to the IE SA, the imposition of a ban on processing ‘which is isolated and divorced from any 
underlying legal procedure would inevitably expose the [IE SA] to significant legal risk and lead to 
litigation’, where the IE SA ‘would be called on to justify its decision to depart from the course of action 
rooted in [the IE SA Decisions] (uncontested by the EDPB and/or the CSAs), in favour of an alternative, 
summary procedure involving the immediate imposition of a ban on processing’521. In this regard the 
IE SA also argues that ‘it is inaccurate to suggest that the [IE SA] could impose an immediate ban on 
processing, whilst continuing to progress its assessment of [Meta IE]’s proposed consent model, in 
conjunction with its CSA colleagues’ 522.  

282.  In this respect, the EDPB highlights that the fact that it chose not to instruct the IE SA to impose a 
temporary ban in the EDPB Binding Decisions, considering at that time that the imposition of an order 
to bring processing into compliance within a short time frame would be appropriate, does not in itself 
rule out the possibility than a ban would be needed today. Likewise, the fact that the IE SA Decisions, 
adopted on the basis of the EDPB Binding Decisions, do not provide for a ban on processing does not 
prevent the EDPB from ordering final measures in the form of a ban on processing in the context of 
this urgent procedure, taking into account the facts that occurred following the adoption of the IE SA 
Decisions. In this regard, the EDPB also recalls that the IE SA acknowledged in the IE SA Final Position 
Paper that ‘enforcement measures may [...] have been necessary at this juncture’523.   

283.  In the next paragraphs, the EDPB will assess the appropriateness, necessity and proportionality of a 
ban on processing.  Article 58(2)(f) GDPR provides supervisory authorities with the power to impose a 
temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing.  

284.  Recital  129  GDPR  provides  elements  to  assess  whether  a  specific  measure  is  appropriate.  More 
specifically,  consideration  should  be  given  to  ensuring  that  the  measure  chosen  does  not  create 
‘superfluous costs’ and ‘excessive inconveniences’ for the persons concerned in light of the objective 
pursued. When choosing the appropriate corrective measure, there is a need to assess whether the 
chosen measure is necessary to enforce the GDPR and achieve protection of the data subjects with 
regard to the processing of their personal data, which is the objective being pursued. Compliance with

the  principle  of  proportionality  requires  ensuring  that  the  chosen  measure  does  not  create 
disproportionate disadvantages in relation to the aim pursued524.  

285.  As a first element, the EDPB would like to recall its reasoning in the EDPB Binding Decisions. In such 
decisions, as pointed out by the IE SA and by Meta IE, the EDPB analysed at that point of time whether 
a ban constituted an appropriate corrective measure to be imposed in the IE SA Decisions, due to the 
presence of some relevant and reasoned objections putting forward this request525. Several of the 
elements that the EDPB considered at the time are helpful to be considered in this urgent binding 
decision, too.  

286.  The EDPB highlighted in the EDPB Binding Decisions that the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR found 
in the case at hand constituted a very serious situation of non-compliance with the GDPR, in relation 
to processing of extensive amounts of data, which is essential to the controller’s business model, thus 
harming the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA; therefore, the corrective 
measure chosen in the circumstances of this case should aim to bring the processing into compliance 
with the GDPR thus minimising the potential harm to data subjects created by the violations of the 
GDPR526.  

287.  Therefore,  according  to  the  EDPB  Binding  Decisions,  considering  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the 
infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as well as the number of data subjects affected, it was particularly 
important that appropriate corrective measures be imposed, in addition to a fine, in order to ensure 
that Meta IE complies with this provision of the GDPR527.  

288.  It is also important to note that the EDPB considered that it is not necessary to establish an urgent 
necessity for imposing a temporary ban because nothing in the GDPR limits the application of Article 
58(2)(f) GDPR to exceptional circumstances528.  

289.  While in the EDPB Binding Decisions the EDPB took note of the elements raised by the objections to 
justify the need for imposing a temporary ban, consisting in essence in the need to halt the processing 
activities that are being undertaken in violation of the GDPR until compliance is ensured in order to 
avoid further prejudicing data subject rights, it considered that the objective of ensuring compliance 
and bringing the harm to the data subjects to an end could be adequately met also by amending the 
order to bring processing into compliance envisaged in the IE SA draft decisions to reflect Meta IE’s 

                                                            
524 EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022, paragraph 284 and EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022, paragraph 286.  
525 More specifically, in the dispute leading to the adoption of EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022, certain objections 
requested the imposition of a ban or limitation on processing or an order to abstain from the processing activities 
in the absence of a valid legal basis (in particular, the objections of the AT, NL, DE and NO SAs). The EDPB analysed 
the merits of the objections of the AT and NL SAs (found to be relevant and reasoned in paragraph 266 of EDPB 
Binding Decision 3/22) and did not take any position on the merits of the other objections on this matter that 
were found to be not relevant and reasoned, namely the objections of the DE and NO SAs (see paragraph 268 of 
Binding Decision 3/2022).    
Concerning, instead, the dispute leading to the adoption of EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022, certain objections 
requested the imposition of a ban or limitation on processing or an order to abstain from the processing activities 
in the absence of a valid legal basis (in particular, the objections of the AT, NL, DE and NO SAs). The EDPB analysed 
the merits of the objections of the AT and NL SAs (found to be relevant and reasoned in paragraph 269 of EDPB 
Binding Decision 4/2022) and did not take any position on the merits of the other objections on this matter that

infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR529. The EDPB noted in this regard that this measure would require 
Meta  IE  to  put  in  place  the  necessary  technical  and  operational  measures  to  achieve  compliance 
within  a  set  timeframe530.  Such  timeframe  was  established  to  be  necessarily  a  ‘short  period  of 
time’531.The EDPB Binding Decisions comprised, eventually, instructions to the IE SA to include in the 
IE  SA  Decisions  orders  for  Meta  IE  to  bring  its  processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of 
behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook service into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR 
within  three  months532.  In  this  respect,  the  EDPB  considered  this  deadline  for  compliance  to  be 
necessary  and  proportionate,  considering  that  the  interim  period  for  compliance  ‘will  involve  a 
serious ongoing deprivation of their rights’ and the significant financial, technological, and human 
resources available to Meta IE533.  

290.  The fact that the three-month timeframe has expired several months ago is an important element to 
be considered, that marks a significant difference compared to the situation that the EDPB analysed in 
the EDPB Binding Decisions. Already the three-month interim period for compliance was considered 
by the EDPB to involve ‘a serious ongoing deprivation’ of data subjects’ rights: the need to ensure that 
this deprivation comes to an end is therefore even clearer now that three times the time initially 
envisaged has passed.  

291.  As a consequence, the reasoning of the EDPB in the EDPB Binding Decisions on whether a ban needed 
to be imposed in the IE SA Decisions provides arguments in favour of considering that the imposition 
of a ban would be appropriate, necessary and proportionate today, rather than against this.  

292.  The EDPB also takes note of the NO SA’s argument that Meta IE has a ‘readily available procedure to 
terminate this processing rapidly’, as it already implemented an objection mechanism in the EEA in 
relation to its processing for behavioural advertising in reliance of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, which allows 
the suspension of the processing 534.  

293.  The  EDPB  also  notes  Meta  IE’s  argument  that  a  short  implementation  deadline  would  not  be 
feasible535, considering the need for a complex process for the implementation of a ban involving 
several teams and many  hours of work536.  More specifically,  Meta contests that it can  comply ‘(i) 
through blanket application of the [objection mechanism] to all users across the EEA, and then “as a 
next step” (ii) “expanding the [objection mechanism] to include categories of data processing covered 
by the [NO SA Order]”, since already the NO SA acknowledges for step (ii) that this “would require 
redesigning the [objection mechanism]”’537.   

                                                            
529 EDPB Binding Decision 3/2022, paragraph 285 and EDPB Binding Decision 4/2022, paragraph 287. In reaching 
this conclusion, the EDPB highlighted that compliance with the principle of proportionality requires ensuring that 
the chosen measure does not create disproportionate disadvantages in relation to the aim pursued, and Recital 
129 GDPR provides that consideration should be given to ensuring that the measure chosen does not create 
‘superfluous costs’ and ‘excessive inconveniences’ for the persons concerned in light of the objective pursued.

294.  According  to  the  EDPB,  the  NO  SA’s  argument  on  the  existence  of  the  objection  mechanism  is 
reasonable at least for what concerns the processing currently carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) 
GDPR  (i.e.  the  majority  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  collected  on  Meta’s  products  currently 
carried  out  for  the  purposes  of  behavioural  advertising)538,  also  considering  that  Meta  IE  did  not 
explain why for the processing based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR a ‘redesigning’ of the mechanism would 
be necessary; also, Meta IE confirms that ‘all relevant objections’ are honoured leading to the ‘the user 
[being] “opted out” of this processing’539.  

295.  Additionally,  while  certainly  the  imposition  of  a  ban  causes  significant  disadvantages  to  the 
controller540,  the  EDPB  considers  that  such  disadvantages  are  not  at  this  point  in  time,  per  se, 
disproportionate  compared  to  the  harm  caused  to  data  subjects  by  the  unlawful  processing  and 
continued non-compliance. In this regard, moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller was granted 
the opportunity to take remedies without facing these disadvantages. As highlighted above541, several 
months have passed since the adoption of the IE SA Decisions and the expiry of the deadline for the 
orders  to  bring  processing  into  compliance  contained  therein.  At  this  stage,  the  controller  has 
undertaken efforts to comply with the GDPR but compliance has not yet been achieved, as indicated 
in the IE SA Final Position Paper, and there is still no clear indication that compliance will be reached 
soon542. The imposition of an order to bring processing into compliance within a short deadline did not 
succeed in reaching the objective it pursued, consisting in ‘ensuring compliance and bringing the harm 
to the data subjects to an end’543.  

                                                            
covered by the [NO SA Order]. As the [NO SA]’s argument itself acknowledges in step (ii), compliance with the 
[NO SA Order] (or an urgent binding EDPB decision based on the [NO SA Order]) would require redesigning the 
[objection  mechanism].  As  a  reminder,  building  the  supporting  infrastructure  and  rolling  out  the  [objection 
mechanism] entailed hundreds of thousands of hours of work by multi-disciplinary teams including product, 
machine learning and infrastructure engineers, user experience designers, operations, policy, marketing and 
legal to design, build and implement the systems, processes and user experience required to enable [Meta IE] to 
meet the different requirements of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The [NO SA]’s speculative assertion that this could form 
some sort of instant compliance solution is fundamentally flawed’).

Report on IE SA IG Decision, paragraphs 3.1.3 and 5.8.2. See also paragraphs 103-106 above. 
539 Meta IE’s Merits Complaint submitted to the Oslo District Court on 16 October 2023, p. 14-15 (‘since the 
launch of the Objection Mechanism, Meta [IE] has honoured all relevant objections without qualification and 
without  undertaking  a  balancing  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  has  compelling  legitimate  grounds  to 
override  the  user’s  objection.  All  that  is  checked  is  that  the  objection  (i)  relates  to  behavioural  advertising 
processing that Meta [IE] presently undertakes under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and (ii) is submitted by a genuine user 
based  in  the  EU/EEA  (to  confirm  Meta  [IE]  is  the  controller  and  the  GDPR  applies).  As  soon  as  Meta  [IE]’s 
operations team have confirmed (i) and (ii) based on the limited information that the user is asked to provide, 
the user is “opted-out” of this processing’).   
This is without prejudice to the conclusion of the IE SA in the IE SA Final Position Paper whereby the compliance 
with the GDPR of the objection mechanism set up by Meta IE has not been demonstrated (paragraphs 7.60-7.66).  
540 In Meta IE’s Letter to the NO SA of 14 August 2023, Meta IE lists challenges possibly arising from ‘stopping’ 
processing of personal data of Norwegian users for behavioural advertising purposes, involving the need to make 
changes to Meta IE’s code and related infrastructure, inform users, provide advertisers with appropriate advance 
notice,  waiting  for  users  to  update  their  apps.  Meta  IE  also  highlights  the  possible  damage  arising  from  a 
suspension  of  behavioural  advertising  in  Norway,  connected  to  lost  revenue,  reputational  harm,  and  future 
revenue losses (p. 8-10).

296.  In light of the elements above, the EDPB considers it appropriate, necessary and proportionate to 
order final measures consisting in a ban on processing, to be adopted on the basis of Article 58(2)(f) 
GDPR.  

297.  The  EDPB  considers  that,  in  this  particular  case,  it  would  be  proportionate  that  a  period  of 

implementation be provided to enable Meta IE to implement it.  

298.  The EDPB seizes the occasion to specify that also the NO SA Order was issued on 14 July 2023 but 

envisaged that it would only become applicable as of 4 August 2023544.   

299.  At the same time, the period of implementation should be a short one, in light of the urgency of the 
situation as described extensively in the sections above of this urgent binding decision and in particular 
of the urgent need to put an end to the unlawful processing being carried out to the detriment of data 
subjects.  

300.  According to the EDPB, in light of the elements in the file, the implementation of a ban in a short period 
of  time  should  be  technically  and  practically  feasible  for  Meta  IE.  This  is  in  particular  the  case 
 
considering  that  Meta  IE  already  envisages  the  implementation  of  a  consent  mechanism 
. Additionally, Meta IE has been aware of the need to bring the unlawful processing to 

an end since the notification of the IE SA Decisions adopted in December 2022.    

301.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  that,  in  this  particular  case,  it  is  proportionate  for  the  ban  on 

processing to be effective one week after the notification of the final measures to the controller.  

302.  Additionally, the EDPB clarifies that the ban should refer to Meta IE’s processing of personal data 
collected on Meta’s products for behavioural advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR . The processing activities to which the ban refers are: (i) the processing 
of  personal  data,  including  location  data  and  advertisement  interaction  data,  collected  on  Meta’s 
products for behavioural advertising purposes, having established in this respect the infringement of 
Article 6(1) GDPR arising from inappropriate reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR; (ii) processing of personal 
data collected on Meta’s products for behavioural advertising purposes, having ascertained in this 
respect the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR arising from inappropriate reliance on Article 6(1)(f) 
GDPR545.     

303.  The EDPB considers that, in general, the geographical scope of the final measures ordered pursuant 
to Article 66(2) GDPR should be broader than the territory of the requesting SA. While it is provided by 
Article 66(1) GDPR that the urgent provisional measures adopted by a requesting SA only apply to the 
territory of that SA, the intervention of the EDPB aims to ensure a consistent application of the GDPR, 
in light of Articles 63 and 70 GDPR. The final measures should therefore have a broader geographical 
scope to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of all the data subjects affected; this scope 
can,  depending  on  the  matter,  cover  several  Member  States546.  The  NO  SA  requested  that  final 
measures,  if  any,  ‘should  be  applied  EEA-wide,  to  avoid  derogating  from  the  harmonisation  and 
consistency that the GDPR aims to ensure’547. Since in this case the unlawful processing takes place 
and  affect  the  rights  and  freedom  of  data  subjects  in  the  entire  EEA,  the  EDPB  agrees  that  the 
appropriate territorial scope is for the final measures to be applicable throughout the entire EEA, and

concurs with the NO SA on the need to avoid fragmentation in the protection afforded to data subjects.  
Limiting  the  scope  of  the  final  measures  to  the  Norwegian  territory  would  indeed  lead  to 
fragmentation in the protection as it would require each CSAs to adopt provisional measures on its 
own territory under Article 66(1) GDPR and to request an EDPB urgent binding decision under Article 
66(2) GDPR leading to the need to adopt final measures limited to their own territory. Such situation 
could also result in a patchwork of final measures and a fragmentation in countries where the SA has 
not acted548. 

304.  The EDPB considers that the addressee of the final measures consisting of  a ban on processing should 
be Meta IE, which shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the decision as regards 
processing activities in the context of all its establishments in the EEA. In line with this, and since 
Facebook Norway was subject to the NO SA Order alongside Meta IE and considering its submissions, 
Facebook Norway – which is the Norwegian establishment of Meta IE – should be informed of the 
outcome and receive a copy of the final measures and of the EDPB urgent binding decision.  

5.1.4  Conclusion  

305.  In light of all the elements above, the EDPB considers it necessary to order final measures, consisting 

in a ban on processing pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) GDPR.  

306.  This ban on processing should be addressed to Meta IE, and become effective one week after the 

notification of the final measures to them.  

307.  The EDPB considers that the ban should refer to Meta IE’s processing of personal data for behavioural 
advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR across the entire 
EEA, as described above in paragraphs 303-304.  

5.2  Adoption of the final measures and notification to the controller 

308.  The  GDPR  does  not  specify  the  procedural  steps  to  be  taken  following  the  adoption  of  an  urgent 
binding decision by the EDPB pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR. It is however important to note that the 
two-week deadline for adoption is specified ‘by derogation from [...] Article 65(2) [GDPR]’ (Article 66(4) 
GDPR). Consequently, the EDPB considers that, in addition to Article 65(2) GDPR, the procedure set by 
Article 65(5) GDPR and Article 65(6) GDPR represents a point of reference.  

309.  The EDPB’s urgent binding decision shall be addressed to the LSA and to all the CSAs and be binding 
on them549. The Chair of the Board shall notify, without undue delay, the urgent binding decision to 
the supervisory authorities concerned, and inform the European Commission thereof550.  

310.  Taking into consideration that the final measures will have to be applicable throughout the entire EEA 
(as provided in the above sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.4), the EDPB considers that the IE SA, in its role of LSA, 
will have to adopt a national decision imposing the measures that the EDPB has considered necessary 

                                                            
548 EDPB-EDPS Joint Opinion 01/2023 on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the 
Council  laying  down  additional  procedural  rules  relating  to  the  enforcement  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679, 
paragraph 115.  
549 Art. 65(2) GDPR. According to Art. 66(4) GDPR, this provision is derogated in respect of the deadline for 
adoption; therefore, the last sentence of Art. 65(2) GDPR fully applies.  
550 See Art. 65(5) GDPR. Considering the fact that the NO SA was the SA making the request pursuant to Article 
66(2), the EDPB will also inform the EFTA Surveillance Authority, in light of Article 1, second paragraph, letter m 
of Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No. 154/2018.

to order as final measures pursuant to Article 66(2) GDPR551. This was already envisaged by the IE SA 
itself552.  

311.  While the procedure set by Article 65(5) GDPR and Article 65(6) GDPR represents a point of reference, 
as mentioned above, the EDPB considers that the deadline set in Article 65(6) for the SA to adopt its 
national decision (one month in Article 65 proceedings) may need to be shortened, on a case by case 
basis, in Article 66 proceedings. The urgency of the procedure is highlighted by the shortening of the 
deadline for the Board to adopt its urgent binding decision or opinion under Article 66(4) GDPR. It 
would therefore counterintuitive, and against the legislator’s will, to imagine that the deadline for the 
SA to adopt its national decision should remain unchanged in Article 66 proceedings. While the EDPB 
acknowledges the need for time allowing the SA to draft a national decision and possibly hear the 
company, in this particular case it is necessary to bear in mind the date of expiry of the Provisional 
Measures (3 November 2023) as well as the prolonged situation of non-compliance leading to the 
urgency of the situation as described above.  

312.  In this case, the EDPB considers that the national decision needs to be adopted by the IE SA without 
undue delay and at the latest by two weeks after the EDPB has notified its urgent binding decision 
to the IE SA and to all the CSAs. The EDPB highlights, in this regard, that adopting the national decision 
prior to the expiry of the Provisional Measures on 3 November 2023 would be desirable as it would 
allow avoiding a gap in the legal situation for what concerns the Norwegian territory. Additionally, the 
IE SA will have to notify the national decision to Meta IE, attaching the urgent binding decision553.  

313.  The  EDPB  also  requests  the  NO  SA  to  inform  Facebook  Norway  about  the  outcome  of  these 
proceedings, by sharing a copy of the national decision of the IE SA and of the urgent binding decision, 
following the notification by the IE SA of its national decision to Meta IE.  

6  URGENT BINDING DECISION  

314.  In light of the above and in accordance with the tasks of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue 
urgent binding decisions pursuant to Article 66 GDPR, the Board issues the following binding decision 
in accordance with Article 66(2) GDPR.  

315.  As regards the existence of infringements, based on the evidence provided, the EDPB concludes that 
there is an ongoing infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR arising from inappropriate reliance on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR for processing of personal data, including location data and advertisement interaction 
data, collected on Meta’s products for behavioural advertising purposes.   

316.  The  EDPB  also  concludes  that  there  is  an  ongoing  infringement  of  Article  6(1)  GDPR  arising  from 
inappropriate  reliance  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  processing  personal  data  collected  on  Meta’s 
products for behavioural advertising purposes.  

317.  In addition, the EDPB concludes that Meta IE is currently in breach of its duty to comply with decisions 

by supervisory authorities. 

                                                            
551 See Art. 65(6) GDPR.  
552 The IE SA considers the NO SA Request to the EDPB seeks to obtain an urgent binding decision from the EDPB, 
‘the net effect of which would be to compel the [IE SA], as LSA, to impose an EEA-wide ban (...) (In that regard, it 
is of course the case that it is not open to the EDPB to exercise corrective powers directly as against any controller 
or processor)’. Letter from the IE SA to the NO SA of 13 October 2023, p. 3. 
553 As described in Art. 65(6) GDPR and paragraph 308 above.

318.   On the existence of urgency, the EDPB considers that, the urgent need to order final measures is clear 
in light of the risks that the infringements represent for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects 
without the adoption of final measures554. Because of such risks, the EDPB also finds that there is a 
need to derogate from the regular cooperation and consistency mechanisms to order final measures 
due to the urgency of the situation555. 

319.  The EDPB also considers that the IE SA, by not providing the information referred in Article 61(5) GDPR 
within the one-month deadline, failed to address the NO SA Mutual Assistance Request and that the 
presumption of urgency set by Article 61(8) GDPR is therefore applicable in this specific case, which 
further  corroborates  the  need  to  derogate  from  the  regular  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanisms556.   

320.  Considering the existence of the aforementioned ongoing infringements of the GDPR and the existence 
of an urgent need to act despite the ongoing process led by the IE SA, the EDPB considers that, at this 
point of time, further enforcement measures are necessary.   

321.  Therefore, in light of the analysis carried out above557 the EDPB considers it appropriate, proportionate 
and necessary to order final measures, consisting in a ban on processing pursuant to Article 58(2)(f) 
GDPR.  

322.  This ban on processing should be addressed to Meta IE, and become effective one week after the 

notification of the final measures to them.  

323.  The EDPB considers that the ban should refer to Meta IE’s processing of personal data collected on 
Meta’s products for behavioural advertising purposes on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and Article 
6(1)(f)  GDPR  across  the  entire  EEA.  The  processing  activities  to  which  the  ban  refers  are:  (i)  the 
processing of personal data, including location data and advertisement interaction data, collected on 
Meta’s  products  for  behavioural  advertising  purposes,  having  established  in  this  respect  the 
infringement  of  Article  6(1)  GDPR  arising  from  inappropriate  reliance  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR;  (ii) 
processing of personal data collected on Meta’s products for behavioural advertising purposes, having 
ascertained in this respect the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR arising from inappropriate reliance 
on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.  

324.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to adopt a national decision containing the final measures ordered by the 
EDPB without undue delay and at the latest by two weeks after the EDPB has notified its urgent binding 
decision to the IE SA and to all the CSAs. The IE SA shall notify the national decision, attaching the 
urgent binding decision of the EDPB, to Meta IE without undue delay.  

325.  The EDPB instructs the NO SA to inform Facebook Norway about the outcome of these proceedings.   

7  FINAL REMARKS  

326.  This urgent binding decision is addressed to the IE SA, the NO SA and all the other CSAs. 

327.  The EDPB considers that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may 

be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties.
