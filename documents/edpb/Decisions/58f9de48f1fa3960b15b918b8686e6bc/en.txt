The European Data Protection Board 

Having  regard  to  Article 63  and  Article 65(1)(a)  of  the  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC 
(hereinafter ‘GDPR’)1, 

Having  regard  to  the  European  Economic  Area  (hereinafter  ‘EEA’)  Agreement  and  in  particular  to 
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  joint  Committee  No 
154/2018 of 6 July 20182, 

Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure (hereinafter ‘EDPB RoP’)3, 

Whereas: 

(1)  It  follows  from  Article 60 GDPR  that  the  lead  supervisory  authority  (hereinafter  ‘LSA’)  shall 
cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned (hereinafter ‘CSAs’) in an endeavour to 
reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs shall exchange all relevant information with each other, and 
that the LSA shall, without delay, communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other 
supervisory authorities concerned. The LSA shall without delay submit a draft decision to the other 
CSAs for their opinion and take due account of their views. 

(2)  Where  any  of  the  CSAs  expressed  a  reasoned  and  relevant  objection  on  the  draft  decision  in 
accordance  with  Article 4(24)  and  Article 60(4) GDPR  and  the  LSA  does  not  intend  to  follow  the 
objection or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA shall submit this matter 
to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR. 

(3) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the ‘EDPB’) is to ensure  the 
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. Pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB 
shall issue  a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the  relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the 
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) EDPB RoP, within one month 
after the  Chair  of  the  EDPB  and  the  competent  supervisory  authority  have  decided  that  the  file  is 
complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of 
the subject-matter upon decision of the Chair of the EDPB on own initiative or at the request of at 
least one third of the members of the EDPB. 

(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able 
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of 
the extension by a simple majority of its members. 

(6) In accordance with Article 11(6) EDPB RoP, only the English text of the decision is authentic as it is 
the language of the EDPB adoption procedure.

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING BINDING DECISION 

1  SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE 

1.  This  document  contains  a  binding  decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 

in  accordance  with 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.  The  decision  concerns  the  dispute  arisen  following  a  draft  decision 
(hereinafter,  ‘Draft  Decision’)  issued  by  the  Irish  supervisory  authority  (‘Data  Protection 
Commission’,  hereinafter,  the  ‘IE SA’,  also  referred  to  in  this  context  as  the  ‘LSA’)  and  the 
subsequent objections expressed by the Italian Supervisory Authority (‘Garante per la protezione 
dei dati personali’,  hereinafter, the ‘IT SA’)  and the German Supervisory Authorities of  ‘Berliner 
Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit’ and ‘Landesbeauftragtefür den Datenschutz 
und die Informationsfreiheit Baden-Württemberg’4 (hereinafter, the ‘DE SAs’). 

2.  The  Draft  Decision  at  issue  relates  to  an  ‘own  volition  inquiry’  (IN-21-9-1)  (hereinafter,  the 
‘Inquiry’),  the commencement of which was  notified  by the IE SA to  TikTok Technology  Limited 
(hereinafter,  ‘TTL’)  on  14  September  20215  and  which  concerns  the  compliance  by  TTL  with  its 
obligations pursuant to Articles 5, 12, 13, 24 and 25 GDPR in the context of its TikTok platform6.  

3.  TTL is a company established in Dublin, Ireland. The IE SA stated in its Draft Decision that it was 
satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning of the GDPR, for TTL, as controller, for the 
processing which is the subject of its Inquiry7. 

4.  TikTok is a video-focused social media platform that allows registered users to create and share 
videos of varying durations and to communicate with other users through messages8 (hereinafter, 
‘TikTok platform’). 

5.  The Draft Decision concerns processing by TTL of personal data of registered TikTok platform users 
who are aged between 13 and 17 years old, as well as certain issues regarding TTL’s processing of 
personal data relating to children under the age of 139. 

6.  The temporal scope of the Inquiry covers the period between 31 July 2020 and 31 December 2020 

(hereinafter, the ‘Relevant Period’)10.  

7.  The following table presents a summary timeline of the events part of the procedure leading to the 

submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism.

(hereinafter, 

in  accordance  with 

On  2  August  2022,  TTL  provided  its  submissions  on  the 
Preliminary 
PDD 
Submissions’)11.  
 
On  11  August  2022,  the  IE SA  made  further  queries  to  TTL  in 
relation to TTL’s submissions; TTL responded on 22 August 2022.  
 
On 7 September 2022, TTL also submitted an expert report. 
The IE SA shared its Draft Decision with the CSAs in accordance 
with Article 60(3) GDPR.  
IT SA  and  DE SAs  raised  objections 
Article 60(4) GDPR12.  
 
Additionally, several CSAs raised comments13. 
The  IE SA  issued  a  response  setting  out  its  replies  to  such 
objections  and  shared  it  with  the  CSAs  (hereinafter,  the 
‘Composite Response’). The IE SA requested the relevant CSAs to 
confirm  by  11 January 2023  whether,  having  considered  the 
IE SA’s  position  in  relation  to  the  objections  as  set  out  in  the 
Composite  Response,  the  CSAs  intended  to  maintain  their 
objections.  On  request,  the  deadline  has  been  extended  until 
20 January 2023. 
On 11 January 2023, the IT SA confirmed to the IE SA that they 
maintain their objection14.  
 
On 20 January 2023, the DE SAs confirmed to the IE SA that they 
maintain their objection15.  
The IE SA clarified to TTL its intention to refer the dispute to the 
EDPB and invited TTL to exercise its right to be heard in respect 
of  the  objections  (and  comments)  that  the  IE SA  proposed  to 
refer to the EDPB along with other relevant documents including 
the Composite Response and the communications received from 
the CSAs in reply to the Composite Response.  
On  18  April  2023,  TTL  provided  the  requested  submissions, 
including 4 annexes: 

                                                           
11 In addition, on 6 September 2022, TTL provided a table setting out the information in TTL PDD Submissions 
which it considers to be confidential and/or commercially sensitive and the supporting reasoning.

  Annexes 2-3-4: Expert Reports  

(hereinafter, ‘TTL Art. 65 Submissions’)16 

8.  Following the facts set out above, on 10 May 2023, the IE SA submitted the dispute to the EDPB in 
accordance  with  Article 60(4) GDPR,  thus  initiating  the  dispute  resolution  procedure  under 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR using the Internal Market Information system (hereinafter, ‘IMI’), at which 
time they also confirmed the completeness of the file.  

9.  Following the submission by the IE SA of this matter to the EDPB, the EDPB Secretariat assessed 
the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair of the EDPB in line with Article 11(2) EDPB RoP.  

10. The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA on 17 May 2023 and 24 May 2023 asking it to provide 
additional  documents  and  clarifications.  The  IE SA  replied  and  provided  the  clarifications  on 
19 May 2023  and  2 June 2023  respectively.  On  6 June 2023,  the  EDPB Secretariat  confirmed  its 
request  to  the  IE  SA  to  provide  additional  documents  originating  from  TTL  or  documents  with 
respect to which TTL already had an opportunity to exercise its right to be heard. Based on the 
exchanges with the IE SA, the EDPB Secretariat asked the IE SA to take additional action to inform 
TTL about the inclusion of such additional documents in the file of this dispute resolution procedure 
before the EDPB. On 13 June 2023, the IE SA submitted the requested additional documents in IMI 
and confirmed to the EDPB Secretariat that the additional action to inform TTL was completed.  

11. A  matter  of  particular  importance  that  was  scrutinised  by  the  EDPB Secretariat  was  the 
right to be heard,  as  required  by  Article 41(2)(a)  of  the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European  Union  (hereinafter,  ‘CFR’).  Further  details  on  this  are  provided  in  Section  2  of  this 
Binding Decision.  

12. On 14 June 2023, the decision on the completeness of the file was taken by the Chair of the EDPB, 

and the file was circulated by the EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB. 

13. The  Chair  of  the  EDPB  decided,  in  compliance  with  Article 65(3) GDPR  in  conjunction  with 
Article 11(4) EDPB RoP,  to  extend  the  default  timeline  for  adoption  of  one  month  by  a  further 
month on account of the complexity of the subject-matter. 

2  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

14. The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the CFR (right to good administration). This is also reflected in 
Article 11(1) EDPB RoP.  Further  details  were  provided  in  the  EDPB  Guidelines  03/2021  on  the 
application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, version 1.0 for public consultation adopted on 13 April 2021 
(hereinafter,  ‘EDPB  Guidelines  on  Article 65(1)(a) GDPR  V1.0’) and  version  2.0  after  public 
consultation  adopted  on  24  May  2023  (hereinafter,  ‘EDPB  Guidelines  on  Article 65(1)(a) GDPR 
V2.0’)17.    

                                                           
16 On 25 April 2023, in addition, TTL provided a table setting out the information in TTL Art. 65 Submissions which 
it considers to be confidential and/or commercially sensitive and the supporting reasoning. 
17  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Article 65(1)(a) GDPR  V2.0,  paragraphs  93-107  and  EDPB  Guidelines  on 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR V1.0, paragraphs 94-108.

15. The EDPB’s decision ‘shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the 
supervisory authorities concerned and binding on  them’ (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is not aiming to 
address  directly  any  other  third  party,  as  clarified  by  the  order  of  the  General  Court  in  case 
T-709/2118.  

16. Nevertheless, the EDPB assessed if TTL was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard 
in relation to all the documents it received containing the matters of facts and law to be used by 
the EDPB to take its decision in this procedure.  

17. The EDPB notes that TTL has received the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard regarding all 
the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered and addressed by the EDPB 
in the context of this Binding Decision and provided its written observations19, which have been 
shared with the EDPB by the IE SA.  

3  CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION 

18. The  general  conditions  for  the  adoption  of  a  binding  decision  by  the  EDPB  are  set  forth  in 

Article 60(4) GDPR and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR20.  

  Objection(s) expressed by CSA(s) in relation to a Draft Decision 

19. The EDPB notes that the IT SA and the DE SAs raised objections to the Draft Decision via IMI. The 

objections were raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR. 

20. The  IT SA  confirmed  that  the  part  of  its  objection  concerning  the  compliance  order  under 
Article 58(2)(d) GDPR  in  relation  to  the  potential  infringement  of  Article 25 GDPR  by  TTL  is 
considered to be withdrawn. Therefore, this part of the IT SA’s objection is not taken into account 
by the EDPB in this dispute resolution procedure and is not addressed in this Binding Decision.  

  The IE SA does not follow the objections to the Draft Decision or is of the opinion 

that the objections are not relevant or reasoned 

21. On 23 December 2022, the IE SA provided the CSAs with an analysis of its views on their objections 
in  its  Composite  Response.  The  IE SA  stated  that this  analysis  is  provided  ‘without  prejudice to 
IE SA’s  position  on  whether  any  of  the  objections  raised  constitute  “relevant  and  reasoned” 
objections for the purpose of Article 4(24) GDPR’21. After setting out its position on the reasons for 

                                                           
18  The  General  Court  found  in  its  Order  of  7 December 2022,  WhatsApp  v  European  Data  Protection  Board, 
T-709/21, EU:T:2022:783 (hereinafter, ‘T-709/21 WhatsApp’) that the controller addressed by the final decision 
of  the  LSA  was  not  directly  concerned  by  the  EDPB  Binding  Decision 1/2021,  adopted  on  28 July 2021 
(hereinafter, ‘Binding Decision 1/2021’) since it did not in itself bring a distinct change in the applicant’s legal 
position  and  constituted  a  preparatory  or 
intermediate  act.  The  General  Court  also  clarified  the 
Binding Decision 1/2021 had no legal effect vis-a-vis the controller that was independent of the final decision, 
on which the LSA had a measure of discretion. As a consequence, the General Court dismissed the action for 
annulment brought by WhatsApp Ireland Ltd as inadmissible, given that the conditions laid down in the fourth 
paragraph of Art. 263 TFEU had not been met. See T-709/21 WhatsApp, paragraphs 41-61.  
19 In particular, TTL PDD Submissions dated 2 August 2022 and TTL Art. 65 Submissions dated 18 April 2023. 
20 According to Art. 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority has raised 
a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the objection or 
the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.

maintaining  the  Draft Decision  unchanged,  the  IE SA  concluded  that  it  would  not  follow  the 
objections22.  

22. The IE SA further explained that it considers that the objection raised by the IT SA is ‘relevant and 
reasoned’  for  the  purpose  of  Article 4(24) GDPR,  with  the  exception  of  the  corrective  action 
elements that are not reasoned23 and that the objection raised by the DE SAs is not ‘relevant and 
reasoned’24. The IE SA’s view is set out in its internal assessment of whether each of the objections 
constitutes a ‘relevant and reasoned objection’ pursuant to the GDPR25. 

23. The IE SA confirmed, when referring the dispute to the EDPB, that it does not propose to follow 
the objections/does not consider them to be relevant and reasoned and that its efforts to reach 
consensus on the issues arising were unsuccessful26. 

  Admissibility of the case 

24. The case at issue fulfils, prima facie, all the elements listed by Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, since CSAs 
raised objections to the Draft Decision within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, and the 
IE SA has not followed objections or rejected them for being, in its view, not relevant or reasoned.  

25. Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the EDPB 
is therefore competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are 
the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection(s),  in  particular  whether  there  is  an 
infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor 
complies with the GDPR27.  

26. The EDPB recalls that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB 
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account 
the contents of the relevant Draft Decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s).  

  Structure of the binding decision 

27. For each of the objections raised, the EDPB decides on their admissibility, by assessing first whether 
they  can  be  considered  as  a  ‘relevant  and  reasoned  objection’  within  the  meaning  of 
Article 4(24) GDPR  as  clarified  in  the  EDPB Guidelines  9/2020  on  the  concept  of  relevant  and 
reasoned  objection,  Version  2.0,  adopted  on  9 March 2021  (hereinafter,  ‘EDPB  Guidelines  on 
RRO’)28.   

28. Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the 
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in

this specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections 
it deems relevant and reasoned29.  

4  ON THE POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE 5(1)(A) 

GDPR (THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS) 

  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

29.  The first type of processing examined by the IE SA in the Draft Decision (analysed within Issue 130) 
relates to the processing of personal data of the registered TikTok platform users who are aged 
between 13 and 17 years old (hereinafter, ‘Child Users’)31 in the context of the platform settings 
of the TTL platform (both mobile application and website based), in particular public by default 
processing  of  such  platform  settings32.  In  connection  to  Issue  1,  the  IE SA  includes  in  the  Draft 
Decision two proposed findings, leading respectively to a breach of Article 25(1), Article 25(2) and 
Article 5(1)(c) GDPR33  and to a breach of Article 24(1) GDPR in relation to the  public-by-default 
setting  for  Child  Users34.  For  completeness,  under  Issue  1,  the  IE SA  also  proposes  a  finding  of 
infringement of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 25(1) GDPR in relation to a specified aspect of the “Family 
Pairing” setting on TTL’s platform35. 

30. Within Issue 3, the IE SA analyses TTL’s compliance with Articles 5, 12 and 13 GDPR in connection 
with transparency, by reference to ‘whether or not Child Users were adequately informed of the 
implications of registering as a User and adequately informed as to the implications of public-by-
default processing’36. In connection to Issue 3, the IE SA includes in the Draft Decision a proposed 
finding leading to a breach of Article 13(1)(e) and Article 12(1) GDPR37. 

                                                           
29 ‘The EDPB will assess, in relation to each objection raised, whether the objection meets the requirements of 
Art. 4(24) GDPR and, if so, address the merits of the objection in the binding decision.’ See EDPB Guidelines on 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, V2.0, paragraph 63 and EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, V1.0, paragraph 63. 
30 Draft Decision, Section F.  
31 Draft Decision, paragraph 32.  
32 Draft Decision, paragraph 34. See also Draft Decision, paragraph 39.  
33 More specifically, the wording of Finding 1 is:  ‘At the time of Relevant  Period, TTL  implemented a  default 
account setting for Child Users which allowed anyone (on or off TikTok) to view social media content posted by 
Child Users. In this regard, I am of the view that TTL failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational 
measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data which were necessary for TTL’s purpose of processing 
were processed. In particular, this processing was performed to a global extent, and in circumstances where TTL 
did not implement measures to ensure that by default the social media content of Child Users was not made 
accessible (without the user’s intervention) to an indefinite number of natural persons. I am therefore of the 
view that the above processing by TTL was contrary to the principle of data protection by design and default 
under Article 25(1) and 25(2) GDPR, and contrary to the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR’. 
34 Draft Decision, Finding 2: ‘During the Relevant Period, TTL implemented a default account setting for Child 
Users which allowed anyone (on or off TikTok) to view social media content posted by Child Users. The above 
processing posed severe possible risks to the rights and freedoms of Child Users’. 
In circumstances where TTL did not properly take into account the risks posed by the above processing, I am of 
the view that TTL did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the above 
processing was performed in accordance with the GDPR, contrary to Article 24(1) GDPR”

31. The IE SA explains in particular that among the platform settings there was one by which all new 
TTL accounts, including Child User accounts, were set to public by default, and that at the stage of 
registration ‘Child Users were presented with a pop-up notification inviting them to ‘Go Private’ or 
to ‘Skip’38 (hereinafter, referred to as the ‘Registration Pop-Up’).   

32. The  Registration  Pop-Up  appears  after  ‘successfully passing  through  the  age  gate’39  and  states: 
‘With a private account, only approved followers can view your content on TikTok. Otherwise, your 
videos  can  be  viewed  by  anyone.  You  can  change  your  preferences  in  the  app  settings  at  any 
time’40. 

33. The  IE SA  quotes  TTL’s  description  of  the  Registration  Pop-Up,  i.e.  this  full-screen  pop-up 
notification provided at the stage of registration concerning the possibility of setting the account 
to  private41.  More  specifically,  TTL  describes  that  ‘Users  between  the  ages  of  13-17  (‘under  18 
Users’)  were  presented  with  a  full-screen  pop-up  notification  highlighting  account  privacy, 
explaining, at a high-level, what a private account involved, and the implications of having a public 
account setting. This notice comprises a pro-privacy nudge containing a prominent button which 
Users could press to ‘Go Private’, and also reminded under 18 Users that they could change their 
privacy settings at any time in the app settings. Steps were therefore taken to empower younger 
Users to make an informed decision about their account setting’42.   

34. With  respect  to  the  Registration  Pop-Up,  the  IE SA  notes  that  opting  for  a  private  account  is 
something that users must positively opt to do: alternatively, they may ‘skip’ this decision and their 
accounts are made public by default43.  

                                                           
obligations under 13(1)(e) GDPR. In circumstances where TTL did not provide Child Users with information on 
the  scope  and  consequences  of  the  public-by-default  processing  (that  is,  operating  a  social  media  network 
which, by default, allows the social media posts of Child Users to be seen by anyone) in a concise, transparent, 
intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular insofar as the very limited 
information provided did not make it clear at all that this would occur, I find that TTL has not complied with its 
obligations under and 12(1) GDPR’. 
In paragraphs 274-275 of the Draft Decision, the IE SA explains why in its view the breaches of transparency 
obligations at stake do not constitute also a breach of the transparency principle in Art. 5(1)(a) GDPR.

41 This description is placed in the Draft Decision before the assessment of Issue 1, within the ‘assessment of 
certain matters concerning Art. 5, 24 and 25 GDPR’, including an assessment of the ‘context of processing’ as 
required by Art. 24 and 25 GDPR. Draft Decision, Section E.1 and specifically paragraphs 68 and following. With 
respect to the context in which accounts of Child Users are set to ‘public’ by default on registration, the IE SA 
quotes TTL’s description at paragraph 70.  The IE SA defines the ‘context of processing’ as ‘the circumstances 
that form the setting of the processing’ (Draft Decision, paragraph 68). In the excerpt of TTL’s Response quoted 
by the Draft Decision in paragraph 70, TTL states that under 18 users were presented with the Registration Pop-
Up ‘To promote the fact that Users could select a private account at any time’. Draft Decision, paragraph 70, 
quoting TTL’s Response to Request for Information dated 26 October 2021.  
42 Draft Decision, paragraph 70, quoting TTL’s Response to Request for Information dated 26 October 2021. 
43 Draft Decision, paragraph 72. This is also reiterated in paragraph 76 (‘Users must positively opt for a private 
account – this is a choice that they must make in order to avail of it or that may simply chose to ‘skip’ this decision 
in which case their account is public-by-default’).  
Importantly,  the  IE  SA  states  that,  regarding  the  public  by  default  account  settings,  it  is  unclear  why  TTL 
permitted the accounts of Child Users to be set public by default, in light of the risks of high severity connected 
to this (Draft Decision, paragraph 160).

35. Moreover, the IE SA highlights that, while during the registration process, the child is prompted to 
select one of the two above-mentioned options, the Child User can choose to simply ‘Skip’ this 
step44. In this regard, the IE SA states that ‘this use of language would seem to incentivise or even 
trivialise the decision to opt for a private account’45. The IE SA further notes that the implications 
of  having  a  public  account  are  ‘particularly  severe  and  wide-ranging’,  given  that  the  published 
content  ‘could  be  accessed,  viewed  and  otherwise  processed  beyond  the  control  of  the  data 
subject and TTL’46.  

36. The IE SA also highlights the ‘cascading implications’ of the public-by-default account on the other 
platform settings for the Child User (namely, videos and comments being posted publicly by default 
too, and some features being enabled by default)47. The IE SA also highlights that the selection of 
the button ‘Skip’ on the Registration Pop-Up by the Child User has a ‘cascading effect of allowing 
many further  platform settings be  rendered public  - including the accessibility of comments  on 
video content created by the Child User’48. 

37. With respect to the implication that each video would be posted publicly by default, the IE SA also 
explains that when ‘public account Users sought to publish a public video, a pop-up notification 
explained  the  implications  of  doing  so,  asking  the  User  to  ‘Cancel’  or  ‘Post  Now’  (hereinafter, 
referred to as the ‘Video Posting Pop-Up’).  

38. In the Video Posting Pop-Up, the ‘Cancel’ button gradient  colour was  a light grey and the ‘Post 
Now’ was black’49. In this regard, according to the IE SA, while ‘TTL notes that there are indeed 
granular level setting for each individual video, and that when a video was to be posted publicly 
for the first time, a Child User would be ‘nudged’ to select between ‘Post Now’ and ‘Cancel’, plainly 
the platform settings incentivised the selection of the posting of videos publicly, given both the 
phraseology used and the difference of colour gradient’50.  According to the IE SA, where the video 
is posted publicly and the user holds a public account, this had the effect of making it viewable and 
accessible by an unlimited audience51.  

39. The Video Posting Pop-Up included the text ‘Your account is public and your public videos will be 
visible to everyone. You can make this video private, or switch to a private account in your privacy 
settings’52.  

40. The  IE SA  also  notes,  in  the  Draft  Decision,  that  ‘the  lack  of  transparency  both  in  itself  and  in 
relation to the use, or rather lack of use, of information relating to the processing of personal data 
in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, in clear and plain language, adds 
to the lack of appropriate technical and organisational measures employed by TTL with regard to 
its platform settings and Child Users’53.

41. The IE SA states that the Registration Pop-Up did not indicate whether the fact that videos posted 
with a public account could be viewed by anyone referred only to other registered TTL users or 
indeed anyone at all54. The IE SA further explains that the Registration Pop-Up did not allow a User 
to navigate to the Privacy Policy or the Summary for Users U18 in order to determine who ‘anyone’ 
referred to, and that, in any event,  both of the  documents  did not clearly explain that a public 
account’s content would be accessible to an indefinite audience, including unregistered users’55. 

42. Similarly, with respect to the Video Posting Pop-Up, according to the IE SA’s analysis, it is not clear 

that public accounts and publicly posted videos could be viewable by non-registered persons56.  

43. The IE SA states that the information provided by TTL, including both the Registration Pop-Up and 
the Video Posting Pop-Up, the references to the terms ‘third parties’, ‘anyone’ and ‘everyone’ are 
‘vague and opaque’.57 The IE SA also rejects TTL’s submissions that the relevant references to the 
terms ‘public’ ‘anyone’ and ‘everyone’ are ‘concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible’ 
stating that such terms ‘are ambiguous insofar as they are capable of referring to both registered 
Users and those not registered’58. The IE SA further finds that ‘TTL failed to provide Child Users 
with information as to that public-by-default processing of accounts meant that an indefinite 
audience, including non-registered users, would be able to view their personal data’59.  

44. Concerning Issue 3, the IE SA concludes in its Finding 5, that TTL did not comply with its obligations 
under  Article  12(1)  and  Article  13(1)(e)  GDPR60.  In  the  context  of  its  conclusions,  the  IE SA  also 
states  that  TTL’s  informational  deficits  do  not  constitute  an  infringement  of  the  transparency 
principle pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR61. 

  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

45. The  DE  SAs  raise  an  objection  pursuant  to  Article  4(24)  and  Article  60(4)  GDPR,  regarding  the 
existence of an additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR62.  They  consider  that,  taking  into  account  the  facts  presented  by  the  IE SA  in  its  Draft 
Decision,  TTL  has  implemented  dark  patterns  and  thus  committed  a  breach  of  the  fairness 
principle63. 

46. Pursuant to the DE SAs, the IE SA’s assessment of TTL’s registration process for Child Users and 
public  by  default  settings  ‘misses  the  assessment  and  statement  that  in  this  processing  dark

‘everyone’ are ‘concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible’. Such terms are ambiguous insofar as they 
are capable of referring to both registered Users and those not registered and this distinction could have been 
specified succinctly and easily. Indeed, per [7.20] of the Response to the PDD, TTL refers to image 9 which states 
‘Anyone will be able to see your contents and likes. You will no longer need to approve followers’. This additional 
context would suggest that TTL was only referring to registered Users, rather than anyone at all’).

patterns are implemented’, constituting a breach of the fairness principle64. Consequently, the DE 
SAs  highlight  that,  if  the  IE SA  followed  their  objection,  the  Draft  Decision  would  contain  the 
additional finding that TTL in the Relevant Period has breached Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by using dark 
patterns to nudge Child Users to not make use of their option whether to set their account as public 
or not65.  

47. According to the DE SAs, the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and in particular of the principle 
of fairness was committed by TTL in two situations, which, in the DE SAs opinion, ‘constitute dark 
patterns on a social media platform by nudging the user to a certain decision’66. 

48. The first of such situations relates to the registration process for Child Users and the Registration 
Pop-Up that appears to users for them to decide between a private and a public account67; in this 
regard, the DE SA makes reference to paragraphs 72, 128, 160, 173 and 255 of the Draft Decision, 
which are described above in paragraphs 31-36 of this Binding Decision.  

49. The DE SAs in their objection argue that, in paragraph 160 of the Draft Decision, with the word 
‘prompted’, as well as with the use of the words ‘incentivise’ and ‘trivialise’, the IE SA indicates the 
use of nudging during the registration process68. 

50. In respect of this, the DE SAs claim that the following conclusion is missing from the IE SA’s analysis 
of the screenshot with the selection between ‘Go Private’ or ‘Skip’: the placement of the option 
‘Skip’ on the right side will lead a majority of users to select ‘Skip’, ‘as internet and social media 
users are used to the button on the right side leading them to fulfil a step and go further (muscle 
memory)’69. 

51. The second situation relates to the Video Posting Pop-Up, i.e. the pop-up window asking users to 
confirm whether they want to post a video online by giving them a choice between ‘Cancel’ and 
‘Post Now’70. As underlined by the DE SAs, the option ‘Post Now’ is written in bold71. Specifically, 
the DE SAs are of the view that in this situation the nudging used by TTL is ‘even graver’72.  

52. In this respect, the DE SAs highlight that the ‘Post Now’ choice is placed at the right side, making it 
a lot more likely for users to choose this option rather than ‘Cancel’ placed on the left side73. The 
DE SAs argue that the nudging effect is amplified by the fact that the option ‘Post Now’ is written 
in bold text, whereas ‘Cancel’ is displayed normally74.  

53. Pursuant  to  the  DE  SAs,  this  means  that  the  ‘Post  Now’  option  will  appear  more  visible  and 

prominent to users, which again raises the likelihood of users choosing this option75.

54. Moreover,  the  DE  SAs  argue  that  ‘the  pop-in  window  makes  it  unnecessarily  hard  for  users  to 
change the default settings at this point’76. This is because the information in the window mentions 
‘privacy settings’, but lacks a direct link to said settings77. The DE SAs argue that this means that 
users who wish to change the settings will first need to select  ‘Cancel’ and then go through the 
trouble of looking for the privacy settings, where they will then need to find the exact setting that 
concerns the visibility of the account/switching to a private account78. 

55. Based on the above argumentation, the DE SAs consider that this lowers the likelihood of users 
changing their settings, whereas the likelihood that users will go along with posting the video with 
the pre-set settings is high79. Furthermore, the DE SAs mention that, in paragraph 162 of the Draft 
Decision, the IE SA analyses that this practice qualifies as nudging80. 

56. In the opinion of the DE SAs, making it harder for data subjects to make a choice in favour of the 
protection of their personal data, rather than to the detriment of their data protection, constitutes 
an unfair practice and processing81. The DE SAs therefore state that the IE SA fails to assess and to 
find  an  infringement  of  the  fairness  principle  under  Article  5  (1)(a)  GDPR82,  due  to  the 
implementation dark patterns83.  

57. Consequently, the DE SAs claim that, based on IE SA’s assessment, TTL implemented dark patterns 
and thereby infringed the principle of fairness according to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. In addition, the 
DE SAs refer to paragraph 8 of the EDPB Guidelines 03/202284, in particular to the point made by 
the EDPB in its Guidelines that the ‘fairness principle has an umbrella function and all dark patterns 
would not comply with it, irrespectively of compliance with other data protection principles’85. The 
DE SAs also recall the definition of dark patterns provided by the EDPB86. 

58. Furthermore, the DE SAs argue that the failure by the IE SA to find an infringement of the fairness 
principle poses a significant risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the TTL child users. 
According to the DE SAs, nudging by dark patterns leads them to make  decisions with negative 
impact on the protection of their personal data87.  

59. The DE SAs affirm that TTL is used by millions of users in Europe, including millions of child users 
and refer to Recital 38 GDPR, which envisages specific protection when the processing involves 
personal data of children. Pursuant to the DE SAs, children are more likely to be subject to dark 
patterns88. In addition, the Draft Decision focuses on the processing of personal data of Child Users, 
and according to the DE SAs, the IE SA’s failing to find an infringement of the fairness principle has

considerable significance to fundamental rights and freedoms of children. The DE SAs highlight that 
this is all the more relevant as the IE SA mentions and analyses nudging in the Draft Decision, but 
fails to name the consequences, i.e. the infringement of Article 5 (1)(a) GDPR. The DE SAs further 
state that TTL, as well as other social media providers, in case of a publication of the decision, could 
view this as a, at least partial, ‘carte blanche’ for using nudging and dark patterns89. 

60. The fact that the IE SA has not found an infringement of Article 5 (1)(a) GDPR, according to the DE 
SAs,  poses  a  risk  on  users  to  continuous  confrontation  with  dark  patterns  that  lead  them 
subconsciously to decisions violating their privacy interests90.  

  Position of the LSA on the objection 

61. The  IE SA  considers  that the  objection  raised  by  DE SAs  concerning  the  absence  of  a  finding  of 
infringement of the fairness principle set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR does not constitute a relevant 
and reasoned objection91.  

62. In its Composite Response, the IE SA notes that the DE SAs are the only CSAs that have raised this 
matter and the IE SA questions whether an amendment if its Draft Decision, based on the DE SAs’ 
objection ‘would respect the consensus position of the CSAs on this matter’92.  

63. In addition, the IE SA highlights that they cannot introduce a finding of an infringement, the subject 
matter of which was not examined in the context of the Inquiry at hand and regarding which TTL 
was never provided with the right to be heard93. 

64. The IE SA has further indicated that it does not intend to follow this objection94. 

  Analysis of the EDPB 

4.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

 

65. The objection raised by the DE SAs concerns ‘whether there is an additional infringement of the 
GDPR’95,  as it argues that the IE SA, based on the facts stated in the Draft Decision, should have 
found an infringement of fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and included such additional 
finding in its final decision96. 

66. The EDPB takes note of TTL’s view that the DE SAs’ objection does not meet the threshold set by 

Article 4(24) GDPR and should be thus rejected at the outset97. 

67. In particular, TTL’s view is that the DE SAs’ objection fails to be relevant because it raises a new 
issue, which is not within the scope of the Inquiry98. TTL argues that, even if the IE SA’s investigation 
took into account certain factors of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the allegation of the DE SAs that TTL used

dark patterns which equal to a breach of the fairness principle was not considered nor investigated 
and put to TTL99. In this regard, the EDPB highlights that, contrary to TTL’s position100, objections 
can be directly connected to the substance of the LSA’s draft decision despite not aligning with the 
scope of the inquiry defined by the LSA. Regarding whether an objection is ‘relevant’ or not, the 
EDPB recalls that an objection as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR may also include 
a disagreement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the investigation and for 
instance may state that the findings amount to an additional infringement of a provision of the 
GDPR than those already found by the LSA in its draft decision101. Indeed, the DE SAs’ objection 
relies upon the content and the findings in the Draft Decision102 to highlight that the IE SA failed to 
conclude  in  the  context  of  its  Draft  Decision  that  TTL  infringed  the  principle  of  fairness,  under 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR103.  

68. The EDPB notes that  the DE SAs’ objection  has a direct connection with the  Draft Decision and 
makes many references to its factual and legal content104. The DE SAs objection, if followed, would 
entail a change leading to a different conclusion as to ‘whether there is an infringement of the 
GDPR’105 since taking it on board would mean including the additional finding that TTL during the 
Relevant Period has breached Article 5(1)(a) GDPR (particularly, the principle of fairness)106.    

69. In consequence, the EDPB finds that objection to be relevant. 

70. With respect to whether an objection is ‘reasoned’ or not, the EDPB recalls that the objection needs 
to include clarifications and arguments (i.e. the legal / factual mistakes of the LSA’s draft decision) 
as to why an amendment of the decision is proposed107.  

71. TTL claims that the DE SAs’ objection is not sufficiently reasoned as it only refers to EDPB guidelines 
in a vague way and relies upon a reasoning that is neither detailed nor precise108. TTL also argues

Decision – instead, the Berlin SA is proposing a new finding altogether. Accordingly, this Objection is not capable 
of being considered ‘relevant’).  
101 EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 26.  
102 The DE SAs refers e.g. to paragraphs 72, 128, 160, 162, 173, 255 of the Draft Decision. 
Concerning the Registration Pop-Up, the DE SAs rely upon paragraphs 72, 138 and 255 of the Draft Decision to 
describe the alternative between ’Go Private’ or ‘Skip’ (leading to their account being made public by default), 
and to the analysis made by the IE SA of the language of this pop-up, which ‘would seem to incentivise or even 
trivialise the decision to opt for a private account’. Furthermore, the DE SAs rely on paragraph 173 of the Draft 
Decision to describe the ‘cascading effect’ that the decision of the users to ‘Skip’ can have on further platforms 
settings. 
Furthermore,  regarding  the  ‘Video  Posting  Pop-Up’,  the  DE  SAs  refer  directly  to  paragraph  162  of  the  Draft 
Decision and in particular to the statement of the IE SA that the two options provided to the users (i.e. ‘Cancel’ 
or ‘Post Now’) would nudge the Child User and the fact that ‘plainly the platform incentivised the selection of 
posting of videos publicly, given both the phraseology used and the difference in colour gradient’.

that the DE SAs failed to provide adequate reasoning in respect of TTLs use of dark patterns as they 
did not specify the precise type of dark pattern(s) allegedly present during the Relevant Period109.  

72. The EDPB is not swayed by these views by TTL, as on the contrary, the DE SAs put forward several 
legal and factual arguments as to why on the basis of the findings included in the Draft Decision 
the IE SA should have found an additional infringement of the principle of fairness110.  

73. More specifically, the DE SAs analyse in their objection that, considering the facts presented by the 
IE SA in the Draft Decision regarding the Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop-Up, that 
TTL implemented dark patterns and as a result the principle of fairness pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR is infringed111. According to the DE SAs, both pop-ups constitute dark patterns on a social 
media platform due to the fact that they are nudging the user to a certain decision112.  

74. In their reasoning, the DE SAs describe in detail the Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop-
Up  and  explain  the  aspects  on  the  basis  of  which  the  IE SA  should  have  found  a  breach  of  the 
fairness principle.  

75. More specifically, with respect to the Registration Pop-Up113 the DE SAs agree with the statement 
of the IE SA that the users were prompted, during the registration process, to select between ‘Go 
Private’  and  ‘Skip’  (i.e.  remaining  public)  and  that  Child  Users  could  simply  opt  to  ‘Skip’114. 
Moreover,  the  DE  SAs  highlight,  as  acknowledged  by  the  IE SA115,  the  fact  that  the  use  of  the 
language  by  TTL seems  to  ‘incentivise’  or even  ‘trivialise’  the  decision of  the  users  to opt  for  a 
private account116. Pursuant to the DE SA, the use of these terms by the IE SA in the Draft Decision 
demonstrates that the IE SA is of the opinion that the users were nudged by the TTL during the 
registration process117. Moreover, concerning the same pop-up, the DE SAs highlight the IE SA’s 
statement, according to which users’ decision to ‘Skip’ can have the cascading effect of ‘allowing 
many further  platform settings be  rendered public  - including the accessibility of comments  on 
video content  created by the  Child User’118. In addition, the DE  SAs state that the fact  that the 
option ‘Skip’ is placed on the right, will lead the majority of users to select this option as ‘they are 
used  to  the  button  on  the  right  side  leading  them  to  fulfil  a  step  and  go  further  (muscle 
memory)’119.  

76. As regards to the ‘Video Posting Pop-Up’120 the DE SAs argue that nudging is even graver when the 
users want to post a video on the TTL platform121. In particular, they argue that placing the ‘Post 
Now’ on the right side increases the chances that the users select this option, while the fact that 
‘Post  Now’  is  in  bold,  whereas  ‘Cancel’  is  displayed  normally  amplifies  the  nudging  effect’122.

Additionally, the DE  SA note that  the information in the pop-up mentions ‘privacy settings’  but 
lacks a direct link to the settings, arguing that this lowers the likelihood of changing the settings, 
leading them to opt to post a video with the pre-set settings123.  

77. The DE SAs also raise legal arguments by making reference to the fairness principle enshrined in 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and to the definition of ‘dark patterns’ in the EDPB Guidelines 3/2022 (with 
particular focus on paragraph 8)124.  

78. Based on the above, the EDPB finds the objection to be reasoned.  

79. In order for an objection to meet the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR, it also needs to clearly 

demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the draft decision125.  

80. TTL argues in its submission that the DE SAs do not sufficiently specify the risks which would be 

posed to Younger Users should the objection not be followed126.  

81. The EDPB takes note of this position but also notes that, according to the DE SAs, the IE SA’s failure 
to  find  an  infringement  of  fairness  principle  poses  a  significant  risk  for  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms of TTL Child Users127. The use of dark patterns by TTL to nudge the users has a result the 
making of decisions with negative impact for the protection of their personal data, and eventually 
for their fundamental rights and freedoms128.  In addition, the DE SAs put forward the argument 
that, as the Draft Decision states, TTL is used by ‘millions of users in Europe including Child Users’129.  

82. Moreover, the DE SAs argue that this all is even more relevant considering the fact that the IE SA 
mentions and analysing in the Draft Decision the nudging conducted by TTL, so if an infringement 
of the fairness principle is not identified, other social media providers, could interpret this as a ‘at 
least partial, carte blanche for nudging using nudging and dark patterns’130. Along the same lines 
and considering the analysis of the IE SA, the DE SAs are of the view that, the lack of identification 
of an additional infringement, poses a risk on users to continuously facing dark patterns and being 
subconsciously led to decisions violating their privacy interests131.  

83. Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objection of the DE SAs, requesting the IE SA to find 
an  infringement  of  the  principle  of  fairness  under  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  in  addition  to  the 
infringements proposed in the Draft Decision, is relevant and reasoned pursuant to Article 4(24) 
GDPR. 

84. Finally, the EDPB takes note of TTL’s position that to introduce a finding of infringement which has 
not been examined during the Inquiry, would be breach of fair procedures under Irish and EU law

129 In this  context, the DE SAs refer to Recital 38 of the GDPR, which  envisages specific protection when the 
processing involves children’s persona data, as they are less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards 
related to the processing of their personal data. In addition, referring to the EDPB Guidelines on Dark Patterns, 
the DE SAs mention that children are also more likely to be subject to dark patterns.

including TikTok’s right to be heard132. The EDPB considers that TTL has been provided the right to 
be heard on this issue, contrary to its claims, since it had the opportunity to express its point of 
view on the objection raised by the CSA on this matter133. 

4.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

85. In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there 
is an infringement of the GDPR.  

86. The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this section, raised by 
the DE SAs, requested the IE SA to find an infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR in addition to the infringements proposed in the Draft Decision. When assessing the 
merits of the objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account TTL’s position on the objection and 
its submissions.  

87. On a preliminary note, the EDPB recalls that the EU legislature decided that a single relevant and 
reasoned  objection  is  sufficient  to  trigger  the  dispute  resolution  mechanism134.  Indeed,  the  EU 
legislature  purposefully  decided  to  set  a  qualitative  threshold,  i.e.  the  objection  needing  to  be 
relevant and reasoned, and not a quantitative threshold135. Therefore, the argument provided by 
the IE SA, that the lack of similar objections by other CSAs indicates a consensus with these CSAs, 
has no impact on the EDPB’s assessment of the merits in the case at hand. 

TTL’s position on the objection and its submissions  

88. As  previously  mentioned,  the  EDPB  takes  note  of  TTL’s  view  that  the  DE  SAs’  objection  is  not 
relevant and reasoned136. The EDPB also notes that TTL is of the opinion that the DE SAs’ objection 
lacks of merit137.  

89. In  particular,  TTL  puts  forward  the  argument  that  the  DE SAs’  objection  referred  to  the  EDPB 
Guidelines on Deceptive Design Patterns138, which were published in March 2022 and finalised in 
February 2023139. In this regard, TTL states that the Guidelines were public ‘well after the Relevant 
Period of this Inquiry’140 and that the DE SAs’ objection ‘was submitted prior to the finalisation of 
the Deceptive Design Pattern Guidelines141. Additionally, TTL objects to the reliance of the EDPB on 
the Guidelines on Deceptive Design Patterns142.

Adopted 

19 

  
 
 
90. The EDPB issues guidelines to clarify and provide guidance on the existing laws and to promote a 
common understanding of EU data protection laws. The Guidelines on Deceptive Design Patterns 
provide important practical guidance that can aid controllers and processors in their compliance 
with  the  GDPR.  These  guidelines  built  upon  and  are  aligned  with  previous  guidance  already 
provided by the EDPB on the principle of fairness: even prior to the Relevant Period, the EDPB had 
already adopted guidance clarifying that the principle of fairness includes inter alia the avoidance 
of deception (deceptive or manipulative language or design), being truthful and not misleading the 
data subjects143. 

91. In this context, the EDPB emphasises that the obligation to comply with the principle of fairness 
stems directly from the GDPR144 and from the CFR145, and applies to all controllers and processors, 
even in the absence of EDPB guidance. 

92. Therefore, the EDPB underlines that the obligation to comply with the principle of fairness stems 
from the law and applies to all the controllers and therefore does not depend on the existence of 
EDPB Guidelines. It  is the task of the EDPB under Article 65  GDPR  and Article 70(1)(a) GDPR to 
ensure the correct and consistent application of the GDPR in individual cases. 

93. Furthermore, the EDPB takes note that, with respect to the additional infringement requested by 
the DE SAs in their objection, TTL is of the opinion that there are  no facts in the Draft Decision 
warranting the finding of such additional infringement146.  

94. In addition, TTL states that the DE SAs’ objection regarding the violation of the fairness principle, 
pursuant  to  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  with  respect  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  relating  to 
younger users is unfounded147. TTL motivates this, first, stating that ‘the Account Information Pop-
Up and the First Post Pop-Up were not unduly detrimental, unexpected, misleading or deceptive 
to Younger Users and complied with the principle of fair processing’148. In addition, TTL states that 
there are no dark patterns implemented in the account information pop-up and the video posting 
pop-up, since they were not deceptive149. The EDPB will assess this key question below.  

95. Moreover, TTL states that ‘TikTok had detailed transparency information in place for Younger Users 
to support the principle of fair processing’150. On this particular point, the EDPB recalls what was 
established in the Draft Decision with respect to the transparency breaches identified by the IE SA 

                                                           
retrospectively, based on Guidelines that were not adopted during the relevant period, b) such reliance would 
equal  to  an  impermissible  retrospective  application  of  regulatory  standards  and  to  a  clear  breach  of  fair 
procedures, and c) if this approach would adopted, it would oppose to the principle of legal certainty and the 
right to fair procedures pursuant to Article 41 of the CFR.

 Report’), addressing the allegation made by the DE SAs that certain information pop-ups

within Issue 3 and the relevant Finding 5151. In particular, the EDPB recalls that TTL was found to 
have infringed its transparency obligations under Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(e) GDPR in relation 
to the processing specified in Finding 5 of the Draft Decision152, but not under the general principle 
of transparency pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR153. In this context, the EDPB emphasises that such 
findings  were  not  the  subject  of  any  objection  raised  by  CSAs  and  therefore  amount  to  final 
determinations by the LSA.  

96. Furthermore,  TTL  argues  that  the  younger  users  were  informed  of  the  consequences  of  their 
decision154. The IE SA stated that TTL provided various ‘vague’ and ‘opaque’ references to ‘third 
parties’, ‘everyone’, ‘anyone’, and thus this cannot be regarded as having provided information in 
a ‘concise, transparent, intelligible’ way155. The IE SA finds that TTL failed to provide Child Users 
with  information  as  to  the  fact  that  ‘public-by-default  processing  of  accounts  meant  that  an 
indefinite audience, including non-registered users, would be able to view their personal data’156. 

97. Finally, TTL is of the view that the DE SAs in their objection failed to identify or to specify any precise 
deceptive  design  patterns,  and  instead  only  pointed  out  the  existence  of  deceptive  design 
patterns157.  

EDPB’s assessment on the merits   

98. Moving forward with the assessment of the question raised by the  DE  SAs objection, the EDPB 
recalls that the basic principles relating to the processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as such, be 
infringed158. This is apparent from the text of Article 83(5)(a) GDPR which subjects the infringement 
of the basic principles for processing to administrative fines up to 20 million euros, or in the case 
of undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, 
whichever is higher159.  

99. The  EDPB  underlines  that  the  principles  of  fairness,  lawfulness  and  transparency,  all  three 
enshrined  in  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  are  three  distinct  but  intrinsically  linked  and  interdependent 
principles that every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between 
these principles is evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Article 6(2) and 
Article 6(3)(b) GDPR refer to lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as 
Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing160. 

100. 

The EDPB highlights that the fairness principle has an independent meaning and stresses that 
the  assessment  conducted  by  the  IE SA  on  TTL’s  compliance  with  the  principle  of  transparency

(leading to Finding 5 where the IE SA concluded that  Article 13(1)(e) and Article 12(1) GDPR were 
breached, but the principle of transparency,  pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR was not breached161) 
does not automatically rule out the need for an assessment of TTL’s compliance with the principle 
of fairness too162.  

101. 

The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect of the principle 
of fairness in the context of processing personal data. For example, the EDPB has previously opined 
in  its  Guidelines  on  Data  Protection  by  Design  and  by  Default  that  ‘[f]airness  is  an  overarching 
principle which requires that personal data should not be processed in a way that is unjustifiably 
detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject’163.  

102. 

This  definition,  which  was  referred  to  by  the  IE SA  when  outlining  ‘the  context  of  the 
processing’  in  the  course of  assessing TTL’s compliance  with  Articles  24  and 25  GDPR  including 
regarding  the  public-by-default  processing  of  Child  Users’  social  media  content  in  the  Draft 
Decision164, highlights the importance of taking into account certain key elements in the practical 
implementation  of  the  principle  of  fairness165.  In  particular,  the  elements  of  autonomy  of  data 
subjects, avoidance of deception, power balance, and truthful processing166 are relevant in the case 
at hand.  

103. 

Additionally, the EDPB has previously explained that ‘the principle of fairness includes, inter 
alia, recognising the  reasonable expectations of the data  subjects, considering possible adverse 
consequences processing may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential 
effects of imbalance between them and the controller’167.  

104. 

The GDPR includes multiple references to the need for individuals to have control over their 
own personal data168. In this respect, the EDPB clarified that data subjects ‘should be granted the 
highest degree of autonomy possible to determine the use made of their personal data, as well as 
over the scope and conditions of that use or processing’169 and that controllers ‘cannot present the 
processing options in such a manner that makes it difficult for data subjects to abstain from sharing 
their data, or make it difficult for the data subjects to adjust their privacy settings and limit the 
processing’170. 

105. 

In addition, the EDPB noted in the past that the controller, in line with the fairness principle, 
must  not  present  the  data  subjects  with  options  in  a  way  that  ‘nudges  the  data  subject  in  the 
direction  of  allowing  the  controller  to  collect  more  personal  data  than  if  the  options  were

presented in an equal and neutral way’171. The options to provide consent or abstain should be 
equally visible, and accurately representing the ramifications of each choice to the data subject172. 

106. 

It is also key to bear in mind that avoiding deception of the data subject means that ‘Data 
processing information and options should be provided in an objective and neutral way, avoiding 
any deceptive or manipulative language or design’, while the element of truthfulness requires that 
‘The  controller  must  make  available  information  about  how  they  process  personal  data,  they 
should act as they declare they will and not mislead the data subjects’173.  

107. 

Another important element of the fairness principle is linked to power balance174, since the 
principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR underpins the entire data protection framework 
and seeks to address power asymmetries between the controllers and the data subjects in order 
to cancel out the negative effects of such asymmetries and ensure the effective exercise of the 
data  subjects’  rights175.  It  is  relevant  to  recall  that  ‘the  personal  data  at  issue  related  to  a 
particularly vulnerable cohort of data subjects – children176, who ‘merit specific protection with 
regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards 
concerned  and  their  rights  in  relation  to  the  processing  of  personal  data’177.  Recital  75  GDPR 
explicitly includes the processing of individual’s data particularly those of children, to be among 
the situations where the risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of varying likelihood and 
severity,  may  result  from  data  processing  that  could  lead  to  physical,  material  or  non-material 
damage.  Along the same lines, children may qualify as ‘vulnerable’ data subjects, as they can be 
considered to not be able to knowingly and thoughtfully oppose or consent to the processing of 
their personal data178. 

108. 

It is therefore necessary for the EDPB to assess whether the two practices (i.e. the Registration 
Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop-Up), which are the subject of the DE SAs’ objection, are in line

The EDPB notes that, as detailed in the Draft Decision, all new TTL accounts, including Child 
User accounts, were set by default public179, and that the IE SA considered that the information 
provided by TTL (which included the two pop-ups) did not allow Child Users to understand that 
their personal data would be visible to an indefinite audience (including non-registered users)180. 
More specifically, the EDPB finds it relevant that, according to the Draft Decision, the references 
to ‘everyone’ and ‘anyone’ in the information provided by TTL, which includes the Registration Pop-

Up and the Video Posting Pop-Up, are ‘vague and opaque’181. Moreover, the IE SA noted that the 
ambiguous terms of ‘public’, ‘anyone’ and ‘everyone’ were ‘capable of referring to both registered 
Users and those not registered’182. This means that the consequences arising from choosing one or 
the other option in the two pop-up notifications were not clear to Child Users183.  

110. 

This is all the more relevant considering that the IE SA acknowledged that ‘where a Child User 
were to avail of the relevant public features of the TikTok platform there could lead in the first 
instance  to  Child  Users  losing  autonomy  and  control  over  their  data’184.  In  addition,  the  IE SA, 
stated that TTL ‘failed to explain and/or to explain clearly the scope and consequences of public-
by-default account settings’ and moreover that ‘TTL failed to provide Child Users with information 
as  to  that  public  by  default  processing  of  accounts  meant  indefinite  audience,  including  not 
registered, would be able to view their personal data’185. 

111. 

Concerning, specifically, the Registration Pop-Up, the EDPB notes that, the IE SA’s note that, 
this pop-up entailed the need for users to positively opt to choose a private account, since the 
option ‘Skip’ led to the account being set to public by default186. The consequence of omitting the 
decision by choosing ‘Skip’187 was to render the account public (as per the default setting) and thus 
to render the content viewable to an unlimited audience.  

112.  Moreover, as the IE SA states and as underlined by the DE SAs, the chosen language (‘Skip’) 
seems to ‘incentivise or even trivialise the decision to opt for a private account’ that the Child User 
was  ‘prompted’  to make188.  The  DE  SAs  highlight  that already  this  finding  in  the Draft Decision 
showed the use of ‘nudging’ during the registration process189. In addition, the IE SA also notes in 
its Draft Decision the fact that the decision to ‘Skip’ opting for a private account, has a cascading 
effect,  in  the  sense  that  this  would  allow  further  platform  settings  to  be  rendered  public190. 
According  to  a  report  of  the  Norwegian  consumer  authority,  ‘when  the  default  settings  allow 
widespread collection and use of personal data, users are nudged toward giving away their data’191. 
The  DE  SAs  argue  that  ‘Making  it  harder  for  data  subjects  to  make  a  choice  in  favour  of  the 
protection of their personal data, rather than to the detriment of their data protection, constitutes 
an  unfair  practice  and  processing’192.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  ‘Data  processing  information  and

transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular insofar as the 
very  limited  information  provided  did  not  make  it  clear  at  all  that  this  would  occur,  I  find  that  TTL  has  not

options should be provided in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative 
language or design’193. 

113. 

The EDPB also highlights another feature of the Registration Pop-Up, namely the location of 
the option ‘Skip’ on the right side194. The DE SAs argue that the placement of an option on the right 
side will lead a majority of users to choose it, ‘as internet and social media users are used to the 
button on the right side leading them to fulfil a step and go further (muscle memory)’195.  

114. 

Concerning  the  Video  Posting  Pop-Up, the  EDPB  agrees with  the  DE  SAs  that  the  ‘nudging 
effect is amplified’ by the fact that the option to post the video publicly is not only displayed on 
the right  side,  which has the  effects  mentioned above,  but  also shown in a bold darker text196. 
Consequently, as acknowledged by the IE SA, the settings plainly incentivised the selection of the 
posting  of  videos  publicly,  given  both  the  phraseology  used  and  the  difference  of  colour 
gradient’197. In particular, the fact that the option to post the video publicly appears ‘more visible 
and prominent’ increases the likelihood for the user to choose it198. As noted by the DE SAs, also 
the ‘muscle memory’ and the location of the button leading to the ‘more public’ option raised the 
likelihood of the  user  choosing it199. This is essential, also considering the  fact,  that  individuals, 
using digital services nowadays, on their phones while on the go, so forcing individuals to choose 
between several actions on the spot, is already a type  of  ‘nudging’200, which can be even more 
efficient when the controllers ‘emphasise; one of the two provided options.  

115. 

As stated above, the EDPB recalls that ‘options should be provided in an objective and neutral 
way’ 201 and controllers should not ‘present the processing options in such a manner that makes it 
difficult for data subjects to abstain from sharing their data’202 or ‘nudges the data subject in the 
direction  of  allowing  the  controller  to  collect  more  personal  data  than  if  the  options  were 
presented in an equal and neutral way’203. 

116. 

Additionally, the Video Posting Pop-Up refers to the possibility of changing preferences in the 
Privacy settings204. The EDPB considers it relevant to highlight that this pop-up ‘lacks a direct link 
to said settings’, as mentioned by the DE SAs205. More specifically, this means that users who wish 
to change the settings will first need to select ‘Cancel’ and then go through the trouble of looking 
for  the  privacy  settings,  where  they  will  then  need  to  find  the  exact  setting  that  concerns  the

visibility of the account/switching to a ‘private account’206. The EDPB agrees, with the DE SAs, that 
this lowers the likelihood that data subjects change their settings, while there is a high likelihood 
that users will ‘go along with posting the video with their pre-set settings’207. As mentioned above, 
controllers should not ‘make it difficult for the data subjects to adjust their privacy settings and 
limit the processing’208.  

117. 

Based on all the above, the EDPB agrees with the DE SAs that the Registration Pop-Up and the 
Video  Posting  Pop-Ups  were  ‘nudging  the  user  to  a  certain  decision’209  and  leading  them 
‘subconsciously  to  decisions  violating  their  privacy  interest’210.  It  is  relevant  to  consider,  in  this 
regard,  that  such  decision  towards  which  the  users  were  encouraged  is  the  ‘public-by-default 
setting’, which ‘appears to be a deliberate choice on the part of TTL intended to maximise user 
engagement and sharing on the platform’211. The EDPB also concurs with the DE SAs that ‘Making 
it harder for data subjects to make a choice in favour of the protection of their personal data, rather 
than to the detriment of their data protection, constitutes an unfair practice and processing’212. 
This is, in this case,  combined with the  fact  that data subjects  are children, who ‘merit specific 
protection with regard to their personal data’213, and with the lack of clarity as to the consequences 
of  the  different  options  particularly  with  regard  to  the  audience  of  the  future  content  of  their 
account. 

118.  On the basis of the findings of the IE SA in its Draft Decision and considering the arguments 
provided by the DE SAs in their objection, the EDPB finds that TTL has infringed the principle of 
fairness, pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of the practices described above, namely 
the Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop Up.  

119. 

Accordingly,  the  EDPB  instructs  the  IE SA  to  include  in  its  final  decision  a  finding  of  an 

infringement of the principle of fairness principle pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by TTL.  

5  ON THE POSSIBLE INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE 25 GDPR REGARDING 

AGE VERIFICATION 

  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

120.  Within  Issue  2,  the  IE SA  analyses  TTL’s  compliance  with  Article  24(1),  Article 25(1)  and 
Article 25(2)  GDPR  with  respect  to  its  age  verification  measures  for  persons  under  13  and  the 
assessment  of  the  risks  for  this  specific  category  of  data  subjects214.  In  Finding  4,  the  IE SA 
concludes that TTL infringed Article 24(1) GDPR in respect of failure to properly take into account 
the risks posed to children below the age of 13 by processing related to a default account setting 
for Child Users which allowed anyone (on or off TikTok) to view social media content posted by

Child Users215. This finding does not consider the age verification system as such. With respect to 
age verification measures, the IE SA concludes that the measures implemented by TTL concerning 
age  verification  are  compliant  with  Articles 24  and  25 GDPR216,  on  the  basis  of  the  reasoning 
outlined below. 

121. 

For the purpose of assessing if the age verification mechanism implemented by TTL complied 
with TTL’s obligations under Articles 24 and 25 GDPR, the IE SA first analyses the nature, scope, 
context  and  purpose  of  the  processing217.  Additionally,  the  IE SA  addresses  the  risks  of  varying 
likelihood  and  severity  resulting  from  the  processing218.  In  that  respect  the  IE SA  finds  that  ‘a 
number  of  clear  risks  within  the  rubric  of  Recital 75 GDPR  arise  which  could  lead  to  physical, 
material or non-material damage’219. One of these risks, as identified above, is that the processing 
concerns  public-by-default  processing  of  personal  data  of  vulnerable  natural  persons,  that  is 
children, and where such children are below the age of 13220. The processing of their data, given 
the high numbers of affected and potential affected users, constitutes processing involving a large 
amount  of  personal  data  and  affecting  a  large  number  of  data  subjects221.  The  Draft  Decision 
 
identifies 

 
 

222. 

122. 

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA recalls that as a controller, TTL is obliged to identify risks, which 
are posed by processing, as a requirement of the principle of accountability and Articles 24 and 
25 GDPR223. Accordingly,  after having had regard to the nature, scope, context  and purposes of 
processing,  as  well  as  TTL’s  own  risk  assessment  set  out  in  the  DPIA  which  accepts  that  its 
processing activities pose a number of high ‘inherent’ risks224, the IE SA finds that, having regard to 
the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, both types of processing which are the 
subject of the Inquiry pose high risks to the rights and freedoms of Child Users, for the purposes of 
Articles 24 and 25 GDPR225. The IE SA concludes that the risks associated with the processing at 
stake were high both in terms of likelihood and severity226.

123. 

The Draft Decision provides for an overview of the measures taken by TTL during the Relevant 
Period  with  regards  to  age  verification,  considering  the  requirement  for  users  of  the  TikTok 
platform to be aged 13 and above227. These measures can be categorised as being either measures 
taken prior to the user’s registration or measures taken after the user’s registration.    

124. 

The  measures  taken  prior  to  the  user’s  registration  are  described  in  the  Draft  Decision  as 

follows: 

a.  During the period from 29 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, TikTok was rated in the 
Apple  App  store  as  ‘12+’  and  in  the  Google  Play  store  as  ‘Parental  Guidance 
Recommended’228. 

b. 

Individuals who wish to use the TikTok platform must also confirm their date of birth 
via  an  age  gate.  Individuals  are  asked to  insert  their  date of  birth.  No  indication  is 
provided for why this is necessary nor does the selection default to an age over 13229. 

c.  When individuals insert a date of birth below 13 years of age, the registration process 
ceases230 and they were blocked from the app231. Users were not informed that their 
 
input  date  of  birth  was  the  reason  for  them  being  blocked  from  registration. 
 
232.  A  pop-up  notification  states  the  individual  is  not 
eligible  for  the  TikTok  platform.  Individuals  who  seek  to  re-enter  a  date  of  birth, 
whether above or below 13, are shown the same notification, and those who re-install 
the platform app on their device233.  

 

d. 

Individuals under the age of 13 who entered a date of birth above 13, 16 or 18 years 
gained access to the age-relevant platform settings234. 

e.  TTL  does  not  require  the  provision  of  identity  verification  documentation  in  the 

registration process (for example, passport, national identity card, etc.)235. 

125. 

Additionally,  TTL  employed  a  number  of  measures  applicable  after  user’s  registration,  i.e. 
aimed to remove users under the age of 13 who accessed the platform in case TTL believed a user 
was under 13236:  

f.  Users and non-users could report a user under 13 using a web form and via the app. 
This  web  form  was  called  ‘Request  Privacy  Information’,  accessible  via  the  ‘TikTok 
Help  Centre’  and  the  ‘TikTok  Safety  Centre’  on  both  the  website  and  the  app. 
Reported accounts were referred to moderators237.

If a moderator in another area considered a user was under 13, ‘they would refer the

TTL also clarified that it does not require the provision of hard identifiers (identity verification 
documentation) in the registration process (for example, passport, national identity card, etc.)242.

TTL does not retain data to determine the approximate number of the TikTok platform users that 
were identified as being under the age of 13 when attempting to register during the period from 
29 July 2020  to  31 December 2020;  however,  TTL  believes  that  the  approximate  number  of 
individuals in the EU who were failed registration on the basis of their identifying as an individual 
below 13 years of age during the equivalent number of days from 14 April to 16 September 2021

highlights that this means that during the Relevant Period, in spite of the efforts undertaken by 
TTL, approximately 
 of TTL’s approximate average Child Users were detected as being under 13, 
and that the number of children under 13 who evaded, and may continue to evade, detection is 
unclear246.   

128.  When  assessing  the  age  verification  processes  that  TTL  implemented  during  the  Relevant 
Period, the IE SA notes that TTL has made extensive efforts to ensure its platform is only accessible 
to those over the age of 13247. The IE SA notes that this included the implementation of a neutral 
age gate, 
, utilising the age rating 
of  the  relevant  applications  stores  in  order  to  avail  of  age-gating  device  settings  on  individual 
devices, both general and specialist moderation teams to identify those under 13 who had passed 
through the age gate, in- and extra-app reporting functions, and

 where those  personal data  had been used to create an account of a  user identified as 

under-13248.  

129. 

As mentioned249, the IE SA notes that TTL did not employ the use of hard identifiers in order 
to  determine  the  age  of  children  accessing  the  platform;  however,  the  IE SA  accepts  TTL’s 
submission  that  such  a  requirement  would  be  disproportionate.  This  is  because  children, 
particularly the younger the child, are unlikely to hold or have access to such hard identifiers and 
this would act to excluding or locking out Child Users who would otherwise be able to utilise the 
platform; also, such a requirement would likely disproportionately affect Child Users from minority 
backgrounds250. 

130. 

The  IE SA  observes  that  Articles  24  and  25 GDPR  do  not  themselves  specify  any  particular 
measure that should be utilised in order to ensure age verification or prevent those for whom a 
platform is not intended to gain access to it, and that the area of age verification remains under 
development and there are yet to be accepted or stipulated industry or regulatory standards in 
this regard. The IE SA further notes that there is certainly no absolute method of age verification 
and that, according to the IE SA, it only falls to it to determine if the measures employed were 
appropriate with regard to the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, 
context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights 
and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing251. 

131. 

Finally,  as  mentioned  above,  the  IE SA  concludes  that  ‘the  technical  and  organisational 
measures in respect of the age verification processes themselves undertaken by TTL complied with 
the GDPR in light of the measures undertaken and the extent to which TTL sought to ensure its 
platform remained accessible only to those above the age of 13’252. 

  Summary of the objection raised by the CSA 

132. 

The  IT SA  raises  an  objection  pursuant  to  Article 4(24) GDPR  and  Article 60(4) GDPR  with 
regards  to  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  IE SA  in  the  Draft  Decision253  that  the  technical  and 
organisational  measures  deployed  by  TTL  for  age  verification  purposes  are  compliant  with 
Article 25 GDPR. The IT SA considers that the LSA should have instead found an infringement of 
Article 25 GDPR in that respect254. 

133. 

The  IT SA  presents  several  different  arguments  on  why  it  disagrees  with  the  conclusion 

regarding Article 25 GDPR in the Draft Decision.  

134. 

The IT SA generally agrees that there is as yet no age verification method such as to prevent, 
in all cases, access to the platform by below-13 users255. However, taking into account the state of 
the art and the severity of the risks related to the access to the social network in question by users 
below the age of 13, the IT SA disagrees with the finding of compliance made by the LSA256. The

IT SA refers to news reports indicating the considerable number of the TikTok platform users aged 
under  13,  as  well  as  to  the  finding  4  in  the  Draft  Decision  concerning  the  infringement  of 
Article 24 GDPR257.  

135. 

The  IT SA  considers  that  the  age  verification  methods  implemented  by  TTL  are  ‘seriously 
flawed’  and  this  is  also  shown  by  the  figures  provided  by  TTL  concerning  the  number  of  failed 
registrations by users declaring to be below the age of 13 during the period from 29 July 2020 to 
31 December 2020 and the number of profiles that were removed after being detected to belong 
to users below the age of 13258. According to the IT SA, the number of profiles that were removed 
means that at least that amount of users below the age of 13 managed to easily access the TikTok 
platform and they used it for an unspecified period (and there can be users of the platform who 
are below the age of 13 that have remained as yet undetected)259. 

136. 

The  IT SA  thus  argues  that  the  above  figures  show  that  the  age  verification  measures 
implemented by TTL are inadequate and poorly effective and it is not admissible, in the light of the 
relevant  legal  obligations,  such  as  those  arising  out  of  Article 8 GDPR  and  the  corresponding 
national laws, that such a high number of users aged below 13 is able to use the TikTok platform260.  

137. 

The  IT SA  also  refers  to  the  age  verification  system  implemented  by  TTL  that  blocks  the 
registration of a user if they select a date of birth showing that they are younger than 13 years old. 
The IT SA points out that users can easily dodge the age gate, 
 
 – given that no check is performed at this 
stage261. The IT SA further argues that the Draft Decision does not specify 
 TTL blocks 
the  user  who  entered  a  date  of  birth  showing  that  they  are  younger  than  13,  since  the  Draft 
262. The IT SA 
Decision only refers to the 
notes that no information is available as to whether the 
 
 is not to 

263. According to the IT SA, 

 

be regarded as an effective deterrent measure264. 

138. 

According  to  the  IT SA,  the  remaining  measures  referred  to  by  TTL  –  including,  where 
appropriate, the implementation 
 as envisaged allegedly by TTL – relate to 
blocking mechanisms that are triggered after a child user has entered the TikTok platform. They 
fail  to  do  away  upstream, prior  to the  starting of  any  data  processing operation,  with the  risks 
arising from that child user’s exposure on the web and the sharing of their data265.  

139. 

The IT SA recalls Article 24(2) of the CFR and that, according to Recital 38 GDPR, children need 
special  protection  with  regards  to  their  personal  data  as  they  may  be  less  aware  of  the  risks, 
consequences and safeguards concerned and of their rights. In the IT SA’s opinion, this is especially

the case if the collection of personal data with regard to children takes place when using services 
offered directly to a child – as it is the case with the TikTok platform266. 

140. 

The  IT SA  finds  that,  taking  into  consideration  the  peculiar  risks  arising  from  the  online 
processing of data relating to below-13 child  users in the  specific context of the  social network 
platform at issue, and by having regard to statistics and media reports, the measures deployed by 
TTL cannot be considered to be ‘suitable and appropriate’267. 

141. 

The IT SA further disagrees that the implementation of such measures is grounded merely in 
their ‘reasonableness’ rather than in a much more demanding, stringent evaluation regarding the 
factual effectiveness of the measures at issue also over time (as also recalled in Recital 74 GDPR). 
Moreover, the IT SA states that the consideration that there is a factually high level of danger for 
child users, should translate into an equally high level of commitment by TTL, which should not 
leave any feasible measure out of the scope of the tools to be implemented268.  

142. 

The  IT SA  in  its  objection  refers  to  alternative  means  for  the  age  verification269.  The  IT SA 
argues that TTL should implement more complex measures that can bring about more effective 
safeguards – possibly without relying on hard verification measures: captcha, asking age-targeted 
questions,  requiring  another  registered  member  acting  as  ‘trusted  third  party’  to  step  in  and 
confirm the registering user’s age, etc.270 The IT SA further suggests that one option could be age 
verification via a public or private trusted third party entity, which could certify individual features 
(here, the age or the fact of the person being above a certain age) without the need for disclosing 
the person’s identity271. Additionally, the IT SA refers to the standard BSI PAS 1296:2018272. 

143. 

The IT SA argues that, considering the serious risks child users are exposed to, as well as the 
nature, scope, context (social networks) and purposes of the processing, TTL should have at least 
made the effort to implement all known state of the art solutions to avert the risks related to the 
processing for below-13 child users273.  

144. 

According to the IT SA, from the accountability perspective, one cannot accept that a leading-
edge  technologically  innovative  company  such  as  TTL  –  which  is  addressing  its  services 
overwhelmingly to young or very young users – has not even attempted to develop more effective 

                                                           
266  IT SA  Objection,  p.  5-6.  IT SA  further  states:  ‘On  top  of  these  legal  provisions,  one  should  take  account 
unfortunately of the aforementioned cases as reported by the media. These go to show, on the one hand, that 
below-13 Child Users are unable to fully and appropriately realise the dangers lurking behind a social network 
platform; on the other hand, they require factually more stringent, targeted assessment exercises regarding the 
measures deployed by the controllers of such platforms to prevent unauthorised accesses. The facts at issue 
have shown that the likelihood for below-13 Child Users to easily access and readily use social networks remains 
worryingly  high  if  the  technical  and  organisational  measures  for  age  verification  are  not  strengthened 
adequately, which ultimately carries the risk not only that equally tragical events take place but, more generally, 
that such users are exposed to dangers’ (IT SA Objection, p. 6).

measures compared to the 

 
, and that it has not envisaged any measures in case of untrue 
declarations by that user except for the reporting by other users274. The IT SA further recalls that 
in the case at hand the ban on access for below-13 child users is a fundamental precondition the 
company is required to fulfil with a view to carrying on its business and, if the company is unable 
to ensure appropriate safeguards, it would have to discontinue its core business with all the related 
processing of personal data275. 

145. 

Based on the above, the IT SA finds that the age verification measures deployed by TTL with 
regard to below-13 child users are insufficient and accordingly Article 25 GDPR has been infringed 
in this respect, since TTL failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to 
ensure and to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR; this is especially so by having 
regard to the likelihood and severity of the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to 
the data subjects’ age, and to the state of the art276. 

146. 

Finally, the IT SA states that were the Draft Decision left unchanged in this connection, this 
would entail significant risks for the protection of the rights of the data subjects277. According to 
the IT SA, the failure to find the infringement in question would set a dangerous precedent, since 
one would fail to flag the need for the controller’s processing activities to be amended and would 
endanger the data subjects in this respect278. This could also encourage other controllers from the 
social networking sector to implement inadequate age verification measures and as a consequence 
enhance the risks for below-13 Child Users279. 

  Position of the LSA on the objection 

147. 

The  IE SA  considers  that  the  objection  raised  by  the  IT SA  concerning  the  infringement  of 
Article 25 GDPR constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection280. The IE SA however states that it 
does not intend to follow the IT SA’s objection281. 

148. 

In its Composite Response, the IE SA firstly observes that the IT SA is the only CSA to have 
expressed concern with the proposed outcome of IE SA’s assessment of the extent to which TTL 
has achieved compliance with its obligations pursuant to Article 25 GDPR. Based on this, the IE SA 
asserts that the consensus position, shared amongst all other CSAs, supports the retention of the 
analysis and conclusion in the Draft Decision282.   

149. 

The IE SA further notes the IT SA’s position that, in finding an infringement of Article 25 GDPR, 
a  controller  could  be  ordered  to  ‘rely  on  public  or  private  trusted  third  parties  “certifying” 
individual features’283. While, as stated above at paragraph 20 of this Binding Decision, the IT SA 
withdrew  the  part  of  its  objection  concerning  the  request  for  a  compliance  order  under 
Article 58(2)(d) GDPR in relation to the possible infringement of Article 25 GDPR, the IT SA referred

to third party certification mechanisms in support of its proposed infringement of Article 25 GDPR 
in its objection284 and the IE SA expressed its position on those mechanisms in this context also. 
The  IE SA  states  that,  leaving  aside  the  question  of  whether  such  services  (as  they  pertain  to 
children)  might  even  be  available  in  each  Member  State,  the  IE SA  notes  that  this  particular 
methodology is just one of a range of possible methods outlined by the BSI PAS 1296:2018 that a 
controller might elect to utilise, either by itself or in combination with other methods, for ‘age-
gating’ purposes285.  

150.  With respect to the envisaged outcome, the IE SA notes that, if the IT SA’s objection regarding 
the  infringement  of  Article 25 GDPR  were  followed,  the  obligations  placed  upon  controllers  by 
the GDPR require the controller itself to determine, by reference to its unique knowledge of its 
own business and data processing activities, the methods by which it will achieve compliance with 
its obligations286.  

151. 

The IE SA further observes the risk of an unintended consequence of limiting the guidelines 

that are currently being prepared, at EDPB level, on the subject of children’s data287. 

  Analysis of the EDPB 

5.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

 

152. 

The objection raised by the IT SA concerns ‘whether there is an infringement of the GDPR’288. 

153. 

The IT SA in its objection disagrees289 with the IE SA’s finding in the Draft Decision that the 
technical and organisational measures implemented by TTL during the Relevant Period in respect 
of age verification processes themselves complied with Article 25 GDPR290. The IT SA requests the 
IE SA  to  overturn  this  finding  and  to  conclude  that  Article 25 GDPR  was  infringed291.  The  EDPB 
considers that there is a clear connection between the IT SA’s objection and the Draft Decision292, 
since the IT SA’s objection relates to specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision293 and, 
if  followed,  it  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  as  to  whether  there  is  an  infringement  of 
Article 25 GDPR294. In consequence, the EDPB finds the objection to be relevant.  

154. 

The EDPB takes note of TTL’s view that the IT SA’s objection fails to meet  the ‘Adequately 
Reasoned Threshold’ as it does not provide any sound or substantiated reasoning for the position 
that  TTL  age  verification  measures  in  place  during  the  Relevant  Period  did  not  align  with  the 
relevant state of the art during the Relevant Period, or even identify what the relevant ‘state of the

art’ was295. Further, TTL claims that the IT SA fails to identify the specific legal error in the Draft 
Decision regarding compliance with Article 25(1) GDPR and contradicts itself when assessing the 
relevant  legal  standard296.  The  EDPB  observes  that  TTL’s  position  relates  to  the  content  of  the 
objection, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility. The EDPB assesses in the following 
paragraphs  if  the  IT SA’s  objection  meets  the  threshold  of  being  ‘reasoned’  in  accordance  with 
Article 4(24) GDPR. 

155. 

The EDPB notes that the IT SA puts forward several legal and factual arguments in its objection 

in order to demonstrate why Article 25 GDPR was infringed by TTL in this particular case297.  

156. 

First, the IT SA presents arguments demonstrating why, based on the numbers provided by 
TTL and referred to in the Draft Decision298, the age verification methods implemented by TTL are 
‘seriously flawed’299. For example, according to the IT SA, these numbers point to the inadequacy 
and poor effectiveness of the measures implemented by TTL and such a high number of below-13 
child users is inadmissible in the light of the relevant obligations under the law300. With regard to 
the age gate implemented by TTL, the IT SA notes that it can be ‘easily dodged’301 and that the 
system  based  on  self-declarations  does  not  appear  to  entail  any  ‘reasonable  likelihood’  of 
effectiveness such as to justify its implementation in the first place302. The IT SA also considers that 
TTL  failed  to  fulfil  its  obligation  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  measures  it  has 
deployed303. Furthermore, the IT SA argues why all the remaining measures referred to by TTL fail 
to address the risks arising for child users in this case304.   

157.  Next, the IT SA recalls that children merit specific protection with regard to the processing of 
their  data  by  referring  to  Article 24(4)  CFR  and  Recital 38 GDPR305.  The  IT SA  puts  forward  the 
argument  that  this  should  be  considered  when  assessing  the  measures  implemented  by  the 
controller306. The IT SA contends that, taking into consideration the peculiar risks arising from the 
online  processing  of  data  relating  to  below-13  child  users  in  the  specific  context  of  the  social 
network  platform  at  issue,  and  by  having  regard  to  statistics  and  media  reports,  the  measures 
deployed by TTL cannot be considered to be ‘suitable and appropriate’307.

296 TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 6.8. 
297 See as well Section 5.2 above.  
298  In  particular,  the  IT SA  refers  to  the  number  of  failed  registrations  and  the  number  of  profiles  that  were 
removed after being detected to belong to users below the age of 13 during the period from 29 July 2020 to 31 
December 2020 (IT SA Objection, p. 4-5).

301 IT SA Objection, p. 5: ‘since it is enough for a user to enter any date of birth in order to register with the 
platform – given that no check is performed at this stage’.  
302 The IT SA also refers to the fact that 
 is blocked after a failed registration and questions the 
relevance of this element for the assessment made in the Draft Decision (IT SA Objection, p. 5). The IT SA further 
argues that 
 is not to be regarded as an effective deterrent measure’ (IT SA 
Objection, p. 6).

304 IT SA Objection, p. 5. 
305 IT SA Objection, p. 5.

307 IT SA Objection, p. 6. The IT SA also notes that the consideration that there is a factually high level of danger 
for Child Users, should translate into an equally high level of commitment by TTL, which should not leave any 
feasible measure out of the scope of the tools to be implemented (IT SA Objection, p. 6).

158. 

Furthermore, the IT SA points out to other available measures for age verification308 and states 
that, ‘taking account of the serious risks child users are exposed to as well as of the nature, scope, 
context (social networks) and purposes of the processing, the platform should have at least made 
the  effort  to  implement  all  known  state-of-the-art  solutions  to  avert  the  risks  related  to  the 
processing for below-13 child users’309. The IT SA argues that from the accountability perspective 
it is not acceptable that TTL has not even attempted to develop more effective measures310.  

159. 

Finally,  the  IT SA  clearly  indicates  how  its  requested  change  would  leave  to  a  different 
conclusion311, i.e. the IT SA asks the IE SA to find that Article 25 GDPR has been infringed since the 
controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and 
be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR312. 

160. 

In consequence, the EDPB finds the objection to be reasoned.  

161. 

In  order  for  an objection  to meet the threshold  set  by  Article 4(24) GDPR,  it  also  needs to 

clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision313.  

162. 

The EDPB takes note of TTL’s view that the IT SA’s objection does not meet the ‘Significant 
Risk Threshold regarding the alleged risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects’ 
as the IT SA’s objection lacks specificity in this respect314. 

163. 

The  EDPB  is  not  swayed  by  TTL’s  argument  and  finds  that  the  IT SA’s  objection  clearly 
demonstrates the risk to the rights for the data subjects if the Draft Decision were left unchanged. 
The IT SA states that the likelihood for below-13 child users to easily access and readily use social 
networks remains worryingly high if the technical and organisational measures for age verification 
are not strengthened adequately, which ultimately carries the risk that such users are exposed to 
dangers315. The IT SA further notes that the failure to find the infringement of Article 25 GDPR with 
respect  to  the  measures  implemented  by  TTL  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  practices 
followed so far by TTL would give rise to a dangerous precedent, since this would fail to flag the 
need for TTL’s processing activities to be amended and would endanger the data subjects whose 
data  are  and  will  be  processed  by  that  controller316.  Moreover,  the  IT SA  points  out  that  other 
controllers  from  the  social  networking  sector  might  decide  to  implement  inadequate  age 
verification measures and this would in turn enhance the risks for below-13 child users317. 

164. 

Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objection of the IT SA regarding the existence 
of the infringement of Article 25 GDPR is relevant and reasoned pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

5.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

165. 

In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning 
all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether 
there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

166. 

The EDPB notes that the IT SA’s objection, found to be relevant and reasoned in section 5.4.1, 
requests the IE SA to change the Draft Decision in order to find an infringement of Article 25 GDPR 
insofar it relates to the age verification measures implemented by TTL in the TikTok platform.  

167. 

The  EDPB  considers  that,  while  the  IT SA  does  not  differentiate  in  its  objection  between 
specific parts of Article 25 GDPR, on the basis of its wording and content, the IT SA’s objection is 
targeting specifically an alleged lack of compliance by TTL with Article 25(1) GDPR. Therefore, the 
scope of the EDPB’s analysis in this section covers whether TTL has infringed Article 25(1) GDPR 
(‘data protection by design’) with regard to the age verification measures implemented by TTL in 
the context of the TikTok platform during the Relevant Period. 

168.  When assessing the merits of the  IT SA’s objection, the  EDPB also takes into account TTL’s 

position on the objection and its submissions. 

169.  On a preliminary note, the EDPB recalls that, as stated in paragraph 87 of this Binding Decision, 
the argument of the IE SA318, that the lack of similar objections by other CSAs indicates a consensus 
with these CSAs, has no impact on the EDPB’s assessment of the merits in the case at hand. 

TTL’s position on the objection and its submissions 

170. 

TTL  submits  that  the  IE SA  finding  in  the  Draft  Decision  that  TTL  age  verification  measures 
deployed during the Relevant Period complied with the GDPR was correct and supported by the 
evidence before the IE SA319. 

171. 

First, TTL claims that IT SA in its objection fails to establish the ‘state of the art’ during the 
Relevant Period and to demonstrate how TTL fell below that standard320. In particular, TTL argues 
that there was no universally established or accepted ‘state of the art’ for internet platforms of this 
type during the Relevant Period and there was no regulatory guidance in place during the Relevant 
Period  –  or  even  today  –  specifying  what  constitutes  appropriate  and effective  age  verification 
mechanisms321.  TTL  asserts  that  the  lack  of  concrete  guidance  regarding  the  processing  of 
children’s data  under the GDPR  is also demonstrated by the fact that various SAs have recently 
been conducting public consultations on this topic and that the EDPB is preparing guidelines on the 
processing of children’s data322. TTL further refers to the expert evidence of 
 (the 
‘Expert Report of 
 Report’), 
which finds that TTL age verification measures during the Relevant Period compared favourably

are  in  consensus  that  TTL  age  verification  measures  were  appropriate  during  the  Relevant 
Period324. 

172. 

Second,  TTL  argues  that  Article 25(1) GDPR  only  require  controllers  to 

implement 
‘appropriate’ measures and these have to be interpreted in the context of the regulatory landscape 
and industry practice at the time325. TTL asserts that the standard of ‘appropriateness’ means that 
a controller is required to implement measures to determine the age of users with an appropriate 
level of certainty (having regard to the various factors set out in Articles 24 and 25 GDPR including 
the risks presented by the processing) not with an absolute level of certainty326. 

173. 

According to TTL, the IT SA seeks to incorrectly introduce a standard of factual effectiveness 
rather than appropriateness, when arguing that an infringement of Article 25 GDPR is evidenced 
because  TTL  identified  individuals  suspected  to  be  under  the  age  of  13 on  the  TikTok  Platform 
through  its  various  age  verification  measures327.  TTL  argues  that  the  neutral  age-gate  and 
supplementary  measures  that  were  implemented  satisfied  TTL’s  Article 25 GDPR  obligations, 
compared favourably to contemporary industry practice and were ’appropriate’328. 

174. 

Finally, TTL insists that the age verification measures implemented by TTL during the Relevant 
Period  reflected  the  best  practice  at  the  time  in  terms  of  balancing  their  effectiveness  against 
considerations of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR329. 

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

175. 

The EDPB recalls that Article 25(1) GDPR requires controllers to have data protection designed 
into their processing of personal data and that applies  throughout the processing lifecycle.  The 
core of the provision is to ensure appropriate and effective data protection by design, which means 
that  controllers  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  implemented  the  appropriate 
measures and safeguards in the processing of personal data to ensure that the requirements of the 

                                                           
324 TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 6.29. 
325 TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 6.31. 
326 TTL further argues that this view is ‘supported by guidance issued by supervisory authorities. For example, 
the ICO states that the level of certainty for age verification needs to be “appropriate to the risks to the rights 
and freedoms of children”, rather than an absolute threshold’ (TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 6.32). 
327 TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraphs 6.32-6.33. TTL further argues in paragraphs 6.34-6.35 of its Submissions: 
‘No age verification method is 100% effective and the Italian SA’s Objection should properly consider that, as 
explained in paragraph 6.32 above, the  standard of “appropriateness” means that a controller is required to 
implement measures to determine the age of users with an appropriate level of certainty (having regard to the 
various  factors  set  out  in  Art. 24 and 25 GDPR  including  the  risks  presented  by  the  processing),  not  with  an 
absolute  level  of  certainty.  The  GDPR  does  not  require  the  absolute  exclusion  of  underage  users  from  the 
Platform; rather, it requires appropriate measures to be implemented. If anything, the fact that TikTok actively 
detects and removes underage accounts, as reflected by the removal figures cited in the Italian SA’s Objection, 
is evidence of TikTok's reasonable, diligent efforts to keep individuals under the age of 13 off of the Platform.’ 
328 TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraphs 6.37-6.43. With respect to the measure of 
block, TTL contends 
that  it  ‘is  in  line  with  the  ICO’s  AADC,  which  provides  that  self-declaration  may  be  suitable  when  used  in 
conjunction with other techniques, such as 
 
’ (TTL Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 

6.42).

GDPR  are  met  and  that  the  data  protection  principles330  and  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  data 
subjects are effective331.  

176. 

As a preliminary remark, the EDPB notes that the measures implemented by TTL (as described 
in paragraphs 124-125 of this Binding Decision above) constitute of an ex ante part and an ex post 
part. The ex ante part is comprised of the steps a) - c), whereas the ex post part constitutes f) - i). 
The  points  d),  e)  and  j)  merely  provide  additional  information  about  the  circumstances  of  the 
measures. Further, it must be noted that, while in the context of the Draft Decision the IE SA and 
TTL refer to ‘age verification’, indeed, little verification, i.e. the confirmation as true or proofing by 
good evidence, is taking place332. Only one aspect of the ex post measures, the identifying users 
that in their profile description state to be- below 13, is verifying the age of the user. The remaining 
measures do not aim at collecting any form of reliable evidence that would allow indeed to verify 
the age. TTL in this regard acknowledges this by calling its solution under point a) an Age Gate, 
rather than an age verification process. However, for the sake of consistency, the EDPB will below 
refer to the ex ante and ex post measures as ‘age verification’ measures. 

177. 

The  EDPB  underlines  that,  in  the  context  of  Article 25(1) GDPR,  the  requirement  for  the 
measures to be ‘appropriate’ means that the measures and necessary safeguards implemented by 
a controller should be suited to achieve the intended purpose, i.e. they must implement the data 
protection principles and secure the rights of data subjects ‘effectively’333. The EDPB notes that the 
concept  of  ‘effectiveness’  in  the  context  of  data  protection  law  stems  from  the  objective  of 
the GDPR to ensure ‘effective protection of personal data throughout the Union’334.  

178. 

The EDPB thus disagrees with TTL’s assertion that the IT SA seeks to introduce a standard of 
‘factual  effectiveness’  rather  than  ‘appropriateness’  when  assessing  TTL’s  compliance  with 
Article 25 GDPR and that the IT SA’s objection incorrectly considers the effectiveness of the age 
verification measures implemented by TTL335. 

179. 

The EDPB also underlines that, in line with the accountability principle, TTL as the controller is 
liable to demonstrate its compliance with the data protection principles and its other obligations 
under GDPR in relation to the processing at stake336. 

180.  While Article 25(1) GDPR does not require the implementation of any specific technical and 
organisational measures, and the controller has discretion in respect of the choice of the measures 
and safeguards, the measures and safeguards chosen by the controller have to be designed to be 
robust taking into account the risks associated with the processing. The EDPB considers that under 
Article 25(1) GDPR  the  requirement  of  appropriateness  is  therefore  closely  related  to  the

implemented  by  TTL 

The EDPB therefore proceeds below with an analysis of those elements, in order to assess if 
the  age  verification  measures 
in  the  present  case  comply  with 
Article 25(1) GDPR.  The  analysis  will  address,  in  turn:  ‘nature,  scope,  context  and  purpose  of 
processing’,  ‘risks  of  varying  likelihood  and  severity  for  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons 
posed by the processing’, the ‘state of the art’, the ‘cost of implementation’ and the effectiveness 
of the measures implemented by TTL in light of the requirements of Article 25(1) GDPR339. This will 
be carried out for both the ex ante and the ex post measures implemented by the controller. Finally, 
based on the elements available to the EDPB in the context of this procedure, the EDPB will assess 
whether,  in  accordance  with  Article 25(1) GDPR,  the  measures  implemented  by  TTL  were 
appropriate in this particular case. 

‘nature, scope, context and purpose of processing’ 

182. 

The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  concept  of  nature  relates  to  the  inherent  characteristics  of  the 
processing340. As stated in the Draft Decision, this case relates to the processing of personal data 
of children under the age of 13 in the context of the TikTok platform, both mobile application- and 
website-based,  in  particular  age  verification341.  As  noted  in  the  IT SA’s  objection,  the  TikTok 
platform is a service that is offered directly to children342.  

183. 

The scope refers to the size and range of the processing343. As described above, TTL does not 
retain data to determine the approximate number of the TikTok platform users that were identified 
as being under the age of 13 when attempting to register during the period from 29 July 2020 to 
31 December 2020  and  therefore  provides  an  assumed  approximate  number  of  prevented 
) and an assumed number of accounts of users 
registrations by users under the age of 13 (
)344. The Draft Decision further 
under the age of 13 being closed proactively by TTL itself (
notes that during the Relevant Period, in spite of the efforts undertaken by TTL, approximately 
 
of TTL’s approximate average Child Users were detected as being under 13, and that the number 
of children under 13 who evaded, and may continue to evade, detection is unclear345.   

184. 

As noted in the IT SA’s objection, the fact that such an amount of profiles was removed means 
that  as  many  below-13  child  users  managed  to  easily  access  the  platform  and  used  it  for  an 
unspecified period – not to mention all the below-13 child users of the platform that have remained 
as yet undetected346. The Draft Decision also establishes that TTL processed the personal data of

at least those children under 13 whose account was detected, and by setting accounts to public by 
default, TTL ensured that the scope of processing of social media content of those children under 
13 was potentially very extensive, being made accessible without restriction to an indeterminate 
global audience347.  

185. 

As established in the Draft Decision, the accounts of registered TikTok platform users were 
public-by-default348. This meant that, for example, a public account was viewable not only by both 
every single TikTok platform user via the app and every single TikTok platform user via the website, 
but  also  by  an  effectively  indeterminate  number  of  persons  who  were  not  registered  TikTok 
platform users on the website349. The implications of this are particularly severe and wide-ranging 
–  the  content  published  by  Child  Users,  including  those  under  the  age  of  13  who  remained 
undetected, on the TikTok platform where the account was public-by-default and not otherwise 
restricted by individual video-settings, could be accessed, viewed and otherwise processed beyond 
the control of the data subject and TTL350. 

186. 

The processing at stake therefore affected a large number of vulnerable persons351 and the 

extent of the processing of their personal data was potentially very large. 

187. 

The EDPB recalls that the concept of context relates to the circumstances of the processing352. 
The  EDPB  underlines  that  the  processing  at  stake  concerns  personal  data  of  a  high  number  of 
particularly young children, i.e. children under 13 years old, in the context of their use of a social 
media platform.  

188. 

Article 24(2)  CFR  provides  that  ‘in  all  actions  relating  to  children,  whether  taken  by  public 
authorities or private institutions, the child's best interests must be a primary consideration’353. 
The EDPB also recalls that, in accordance with Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, ‘the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration’354. As pointed 
out both by the IE SA in the Draft Decision and by the IT SA in its objection, the GDPR recognises 
children as a vulnerable category of natural persons. This is displayed by a number of provisions in 
the GDPR355.  In  particular,  Recital 38 GDPR  states  that  children  ‘merit  specific  protection  with 
regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards 
concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data’356. Moreover, as raised

by the IT SA357,  the GDPR,  for instance its Article 8358, envisages  enhanced requirements  for the 
processing  of  personal  data  of  children  under  the  age  of  13  and  in  some  cases,  depending  on 
Member State law, even for children of up to 16 years of age359.  

189. 

The consideration of the special protection guaranteed for children is particularly relevant in 
the  present  case  as  the  TikTok  platform  is  a  social  media  service  that  is  offered  directly  to 
children360 - i.e. there is an offer of information society services directly to a child361.  

190. 

The EDPB also observes that the processing of personal data is at the core of the TTL business 
and  the  ban  on  access  for  below-13  child  users  to  the  TikTok  platform  is  a  fundamental 
precondition  TTL  is  required  to  fulfil  with  a  view  to  carrying  out  its  business362.  As  the  IT SA 
highlights, the company would have to otherwise discontinue its core business with all the related 
processing of personal data363.  

191.  Moreover,  as  observed  by  the  IT SA  in  its  objection364,  there  have  been  numerous  reports 
indicating possible dangers to children related to their use of the TikTok platform. These risks were 
 
also acknowledged by TTL in its DPIA (
 
 

365).  

192. 

The purpose pertains to the aims of the processing366. TTL provides the TikTok platform367. 
The  Draft  Decision  states  that  ‘TikTok  is  a  video-focused  social  media  platform  that  allows 
registered users to create and share videos of varying durations and to communicate with other 
users through messages’368. As submitted by TTL, it ‘provided a global entertainment platform that, 
at its core, was designed to enable Users to create and share video content, enjoy videos from a 
variety of creators, and otherwise express their creativity, such as by interacting with videos to 
express new perspectives and ideas’369.  

                                                           
357 IT SA Objection, p. 5. The IT SA refers to Art. 8 GDPR. 
358  Art.  8  (1) GDPR.  The  EDPB  also  recalls  that  Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR,  referring  to  the  legal  basis  for  processing 
consisting in the necessity for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, raises in 
particular the case where the data subject is a child in the context of the balancing exercise to be carried out by 
the controller.  The EDPB  further recalls that, if a  data  subject  is a  child, this is also a  relevant  factor  for the 
controller  to  take  into  account  when  relying  on  Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR,  see  EDPB  Guidelines  2/2019  on 
Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, paragraph 13.

193. 

This primary purpose informed the way in which the TikTok platform operated370, while TTL, 
as a private company, is pursuing commercial interest by carrying out the processing in the context 
of its services. In this respect, the EDPB observes that the number of users of the TikTok platform 
and the level of their engagement in the TikTok platform in relation to the processing at stake has 
relevance for commercial interests of TTL. 

‘risks  of  varying  likelihood  and  severity  for  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons  posed  by  the 
processing’ 

194. 

As a general remark, the EDPB recalls that, when performing the risk analysis for compliance 
with Article 25(1) GDPR, the controller has to identify the risks to the rights of data subjects and 
determine their likelihood and severity in order to implement measures to effectively mitigate the 
identified risks371. A systematic and thorough evaluation of the processing is crucial when doing 
risk assessments. The controller must always carry out a data protection risk assessment on a case 
by case basis for the processing activity at hand and verify the effectiveness of the appropriate 
measures and safeguards envisaged372. 

195. 

Therefore, in complying with the requirements of Article 25(1) GDPR, in the first instance, it is 
necessary to identify the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects that a violation of the 
data protection principles presents. The controller must have regard to the likelihood and severity 
of those risks and must implement measures to effectively mitigate them. 

196. 

Recital 75 GDPR  provides  examples  of  risks  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons. 
These  risks  may  include  physical,  material  or  non-material  damage  to  natural  persons373. 
Recital 76 GDPR  provides  guidance  as  to  how  risk  should  be  evaluated,  i.e.  by reference  to  the 
nature,  scope,  context  and  purposes  of  the  processing  and  on  the  basis  of  an  objective 
assessment374. The EDPB recalls that the GDPR adopts a coherent risk based approach in many of 
its provisions, in Articles 24, 25, 32 and 35 GDPR, with a view to identifying appropriate technical

197. 

The EDPB takes note that TTL has conducted the risk assessment with regard to the use of the 
TikTok platform by Child Users. Schedule 2 to the TTL Children’s Data and Age Appropriate Design 
DPIA376 sets out the risks identified, a description of the risk, an assessment of the risk level before 
any mitigations are put in place (‘Inherent Risk’), the proposed mitigation measures to be put in 
place, and an assessment of the risk level after the relevant mitigations have been put in place 
(‘Residual Risk’). The methodology for calculating the overall risk score for each risk is as follows:

and the Residual Risk377.

As stated in the Draft Decision, TTL identifies 

379. In relation to its mitigation measures, TTL determines that 

 
 
380. However, the IE SA in the Draft Decision indicates that there 

is still a high risk in terms of likelihood and severity381. 

200. 

The EDPB takes note that TTL disagrees with that categorisation of the risk, as TTL considers 
that the risks outlined by the IE SA are potential and hypothetical risks at best and some of them 
are outside the  scope of data  protection law382. However, first, the EDPB notes that the IE SA’s 
assessment of the level of the risk is not disputed by any of the CSAs and, secondly, the EDPB agrees 
with the IE SA’s assessment in this respect and is not swayed by the arguments of TTL.   

201. 

At the outset, the EDPB observes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA notes that TTL Children’s 
Data and Age Appropriate Design DPIA identifies neither the risk of children under the age of 13 
accessing the TikTok platform, nor the further risks to them that may arise from this383. The EDPB 
considers that TTL’s failure to specifically assess the risks for children under the age of 13 were 
they  to  get  access  to  the  TikTok  platform  has  clear  implications  for  TTL’s  ability  to  implement 
appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures  in  accordance  with  Article 25(1) GDPR.  As 
recalled above384, the risk assessment is necessary in order to verify the required effectiveness and 
the appropriateness of the measures and safeguards envisaged. 

202. 

The EDPB recalls that children are recognised as vulnerable persons under GDPR385 and this 
case concerns processing of the personal data of particularly young children, i.e. under the age of 
13. Further, the EDPB observes that TTL itself determines that even for users above 13 covered by 
TTL Children’s Data and Age Appropriate Design DPIA, 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

388.  

203. 

The EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s remark that, with respect to Child Users, including children 
under the age of 13 who were to gain access to the TikTok platform, due to the relevant public 
features of the TikTok platform, the risks for Child Users include: loss of autonomy and control over 
their data, and possibly becoming targets for bad actors, given the public nature of their use of the 
TikTok  platform;  them  becoming  subject  to  a  wide  range  of  potentially  deleterious  activities,

including online  exploitation or grooming, or further physical, material or non-material damage 
where they inherently or advertently reveal identifying personal data; risk of social anxiety, self-
esteem issues, bullying or peer pressure389.  

204. 

The EDPB also agrees with the IE SA’s assessment that, while the risks identified in the TTL 
Children’s Data and Age Appropriate Design DPIA apply equally to children under the age of 13 as 
those over the age of 13, the risks associated with these users are exacerbated and particularly 
severe given their young age and that the TikTok platform is expressly not intended for those under 
the age of 13390. Indeed, TTL explained that it offers the TikTok platform to users, who are 13 years 
old or older391. The TikTok platform has a content rating on the Apple App store of ‘12+’ and on the 
Google Play store of ‘Parental Guidance Recommended’392. 

205. 

Furthermore,  the  EDPB  concurs  with  the  IE SA  regarding  the  risks  identified  in  the  Draft 
Decision  specifically  for  children  under  the  age  of  13  who  were  to  gain  access  to  the  TikTok 
platform393,  in  particular  the  risk  of  viewing  and  accessing  materials  that  are  harmful  or 
inappropriate for a child of such youth, particularly given that the TikTok platform is not intended 
for children under 13394.  

206. 

The  EDPB  also  recalls  that  in  the  Draft  Decision  the  IE SA  found  that  the  public-by-default 
account setting exposes social media posts by Child Users to an indeterminate audience and that 
this presents a severe risk for Child Users395. This is even more pertinent in relation to a significant 
number of children under the age of 13 who had access to the TikTok Platform for an undetermined 
period396.  

207. 

Considering the above and taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of 
processing, the EDPB shares the conclusion of the IE SA in its Draft Decision that the processing at 
stake poses  high risks  and that those  risks  associated with the  processing analysed in the Draft 
Decision were high both in terms of likelihood and severity397. 

208. 

The above assessment is applicable both for the ex ante and the ex post measures. 

’State of the art’ and ‘cost of implementation’ 

209.  Under  Article 25(1) GDPR,  the  reference  to  ‘state  of  the  art’  imposes  an  obligation  on 
controllers,  when  determining  the  appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures,  to  take 
account of the current progress in technology that is available in the market398. In this respect, the

EDPB  underlines  that  the  principle  of  accountability  is  an  overarching  one  and  requires  the 
controller to take up its responsibility in choosing the measures to be applied399.  

210. 

In line with TTL’s accountability obligations, TTL had an obligation to consider and assess the 
measures available in the market when choosing the age verification measures that it considered 
to be appropriate technical and organisational measures400 in accordance with Article 25(1) GDPR. 
When  it  comes  to  the  evaluation  of  the  state  of  the  art,  therefore,  TTL  has  to  be  able  to 
demonstrate  in  the  particular  case  that  it  has  assessed  and  takes  into  account  the  state  of  art 
measures  regarding  age  verification  in  order  to  secure  effective  implementation  of  the  data 
protection principles and rights of data subjects.  

211. 

First, the EDPB wishes to reply to TTL’s submission that during the Relevant Period there was 
no  regulatory  guidance  in  place  specifying  what  constitutes  appropriate  and  effective  age 
verification  mechanisms401.  In  this  regard,  the  EDPB  refers  to  paragraphs  91-92  of  this  Binding 
Decision and recalls that the obligations of controllers stem directly from the GDPR. The application 
of controllers’ obligations under Article 25(1) GDPR to take into consideration the state of the art 
is not conditional upon existence of any further regulatory guidance regarding the measures to be 
implemented in a particular case402. In addition, the fact that the supervisory authorities or the 
EDPB  are  working  on  the  future  guidelines  in  a  relevant  field  does  not  affect  the  need  for  the 
controller to comply from the outset with its obligations stemming from the GDPR.  

212. 

In  any  case,  the  EDPB  highlights  that  there  was  relevant  guidance  by  the  EDPB  on  age 

verification in its Guidelines 05/2020 on Consent403.  

213. 

The IT SA describes in its objection the concept of requiring a trusted third party to verify the 
identity and age of the user and makes reference to the BSI PAS 1296:2018 standard404. The EDPB 
highlights that the concept of requiring a trusted third party to verify the identity and age of the 
user is long established in some Member States 405 and that the BSI PAS 1296:2018406 existed during 
the Relevant Period. This standard of the British Standards Institution has provided a framework 
for age check systems and is relevant to assess the available measures for age verification during 
the Relevant Period.

Furthermore, the EDPB underlines that the issue of age verification is not a new issue nor an 
issue limited to the context of the protection of personal data407. The practices with regard to age 
verification  in  other  fields  have  to  be  taken  into  account  when  assessing  the  question  of  what 
constitutes the ‘state of the art’ in the context of Article 25(1) GDPR408. By way of clarification, the 
elements identified by the EDPB are not meant to be exhaustive.   

215. 

The EDPB also points out that the state of the art is not statically defined at a fixed point in 
time, but should be assessed continuously in the context of technological progress. If a controller 
fails to keep up to date with technological changes, this could result in a lack of compliance with 
Article 25 (1) GDPR409.  

216. 

In reply to TTL’s assertion that the age verification measures implemented by TTL during the 
Relevant Period compare, according to the expert report submitted by TTL, favourably to those of 
its  competitors410,  the  EDPB  points  out  that  a  particular  controller’s  compliance  with 
Article 25 GDPR is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature, context, scope 
and purpose of the processing at stake, as well as the risk to fundamental rights and freedoms of 
individuals in each specific case. Moreover, the potential infringement of the law by another party 
does not legitimise one’s own infringement of the law. The EDPB is therefore not swayed by this 
argument.  

217. 

Taking into account the elements available to the EDPB in the context of this procedure the 
EDPB considers that, in this particular case, it does not have sufficient information to conclusively 
assess,  pursuant  to  Article  25(1)  GDPR,  the  state  of  art  element  in  relation  to  measures 
implemented by TTL for the age verification of children as young as 13 years old during the Relevant 
Period. 

218. 

Finally, regarding the ‘cost’ element in Article 25(1) GDPR, the EDPB recalls that the controller 
is not required to spend a disproportionate amount of resources when alternative, less resource-
demanding, yet effective measures exist. However, the chosen measures need to ensure that the 
processing activity foreseen by the data controller does not process personal data in violation of 
the data protection principles, regardless of cost411. 

219. 

The EDPB observes that in the present case TTL has not made any submissions demonstrating 
disproportionate cost for the implementation of the possible additional or alternative measures 
with regard to age verification on the TikTok platform. In any case, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA 
that a leading-edge  technologically innovative company such as TTL that is addressing its social 
media services to children should be in a position to consider all available measures to ensure its 
compliance with Article 25 GDPR in an effective manner412.

Whether  the  technical  and  organisational  measures  implemented  by  TTL  with  regard  to  age 
verification were ‘effective’ 

220. 

The EDPB recalls that, as established in the Draft Decision413, TTL implemented the technical 
and organisational measures for age verification during the registration process to prevent children 
under the age of 13 from accessing the TikTok platform as described in paragraphs 124-125 of this 
Binding Decision above. 

221. 

The  EDPB  notes  that  under  Article 25(1) GDPR  the  requirement  for  the  measures  to  be 
‘appropriate’ means that the measures and necessary safeguards implemented by a data controller 
should be suited to achieve the intended purpose, i.e. they must implement the data protection 
principles enumerated in Article 5(1) GDPR ‘in an effective manner’414.  

222. 

In light of the above, the EDPB proceeds to evaluate the effectiveness or contribution to the 
effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures implemented by TTL in the case at hand.  

223. 

The EDPB recalls the principle of accountability and notes that TTL as the data controller in 
the present case is responsible for and has to be able to demonstrate its compliance with the data 
protection  principles  under  Article 5(1) GDPR  and  other  provisions  of  the GDPR415.  The 
accountability principle requires the controller to ‘demonstrate the effects of the measures taken 
to protect the data subjects’ rights, and why the measures are considered to be appropriate and 
effective’416, thus it puts focus on the element of demonstration. With regard to the protection of 
children’s  rights  under  the GDPR  and  determining  whether  children  are  actually  affected,  the 
controller needs to be able to demonstrate effective measures for ensuring that the processing of 
their  personal  data  is  in  compliance  with  the  data  protection  principles  as  discussed  in  detail 
subsequently.   

224. 

 Therefore, TTL is responsible to demonstrate that it has assessed the feasible alternatives and 
chosen  appropriate  measures  for  age  verification  taking  into  account  all  the  elements  listed  in 
Article 25(1) GDPR. In particular, TTL is liable to demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures 
chosen in the particular case. This is particularly important when the demonstration of compliance 
is linked to the protection of vulnerable data subjects such as children.  

225. 

As  mentioned  above,  the  analysis  of  effectiveness  under  Article  25(1)  GDPR  refers  to  the 
implementation of data protection principles, i.e. all the principles enshrined in Article 5 GDPR. The 
IT SA’s objection mentions in particular the principle of data minimisation417. In this regard, the 
EDPB recalls that Article 5(1)(c) GDPR requires TTL to ensure that it only processes personal data 
that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which they 
are processed. Per TTL’s Terms of Service, users of the TikTok platform418 must be at least 13 years 
of age419. Therefore, for the purpose of providing its service, i.e. the TikTok platform420, TTL could

Adopted

only process personal data of users of at least 13 years of age421. TTL should have implemented 
technical and organisational measures to this end.  

226. 

As noted above422, a particularly high number of users below the age of 13 was able to gain 
access  to  the  TikTok  platform,  therefore  TTL  processed  a  high  volume  of  personal  data  of 
vulnerable data subjects, i.e. children under the age of 13, during the Relevant Period, even though 
it  was  not  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  providing  its  service.  Considering  such  high  volume  of 
personal data accidentally processed by TTL, the EDPB shares the concerns of the IT SA423 regarding 
the lack of effective implementation by TTL of the principle of data minimisation in the present 
case. 

227. 

As  outlined  in  paragraphs  182-208  of  this  Binding  Decision  above,  in  particular  due  to  the 
nature of the processing that concerns children under 13 and the context being the accessibility of 
a social media platform for a high number of such children, who constitute particularly vulnerable 
data subjects requiring specific protection and considering the high risk posed by the processing at 
stake, the EDPB is of the view that a particularly high level of effectiveness424 is necessary to meet 
the requirements of Article 25(1) GDPR. Taking this into account, the EDPB does not find that the 
situation  analysed  in the  present  case  is  such where  a  reduced  level  of  effectiveness  would  be 
appropriate. The measures implemented by TTL need to be analysed bearing this in mind. 

228.  When considering the level of ‘effectiveness’ of the measures implemented by TTL, the EDPB 
first notes the view of the IT SA that the age gate can be ‘easily dodged’425. The EDPB agrees that 
the factor that an age verification system can be ‘easily circumvented’ constitutes a relevant factor 
considering the effectiveness of the measures in place426. 

229. 

Second, the EDPB takes account of TTL’s indication that ‘if an individual entered a birth date 
which indicated that they were under 13, they were simply told they were ineligible for an account. 
By not explaining the reason for either presenting the age-gate or for preventing a potential user 
from  creating  an  account,  this  ensured  that  individuals  were  not  encouraged  to  provide  an 
inaccurate birthdate’427. While the  EDPB takes note of the age  gate was presented in a neutral 
manner,  it  observes  that  such  measure  in  itself  does  not  ensure  sufficient  discouragement  of 
individuals  to  not  enter  an  inaccurate  date  of  birth.  As  described  above428,  the  date  of  birth 
constitutes  the  only  information  a  user  needs  to  provide  before  receiving  the  prompt  of  non-
eligibility. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that an individual younger than 13 could conclude that 
the date of birth would constitute the sole factor for assessing their eligibility to access the TikTok 
platform.  

                                                           
to create and share video content, enjoy videos from a variety of creators, and otherwise express their creativity, 
such as by interacting with videos to express new perspectives and ideas’.

230. 

Additionally, as with methods based on obscurity, once a way of circumvention is known, this 
method can be easily shared with peers to facilitate them circumventing the measure in place. 
Lastly, the EDPB takes note of the fact that the TikTok app was rated as 12+ in the Apple store429, 
therefore an individual interested in getting access to the TikTok platform could easily infer that in 
order to access the TikTok platform they needed to enter a date of birth indicating that their age 
is higher than 12 years old.

verification process.

The EDPB further points out that the 

 Report submitted by TTL itself notes431 that the 
EDPB Guidelines on Consent indicate that ‘[i]n some low-risk situations, it may be appropriate to 
require a new subscriber to a service to disclose their year of birth or to fill out a form stating they 
are (not) a minor’432. However,  TTL’s own risk assessment  clearly indicates 
 
 Report does not take note, 
however, of the following paragraphs of the EDPB Guidelines on Consent stating that: ‘In low-risk 
cases, verification of parental responsibility via email may  be  sufficient. Conversely,  in high-risk 
cases, it may be appropriate to ask for more proof, so that the controller is able to verify and retain 
the information pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR. Trusted third party verification services may offer 
solutions,  which  minimise  the  amount  of  personal  data  the  controller  has  to  process  itself’434. 
Therefore,  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on Consent make  it  clear  that  more  proof or proof of  a  higher 
quality is appropriate in high-risks cases and refer to trusted third party verification services in this 
respect (a solution indicated by the IT SA in its objection435).

Taking  into  account  the  above436,  with  respect  to  ‘effectiveness’  of  the  ex  ante  measures 
implemented by TTL, the EDPB expresses serious doubts as to whether the self-verification by the 
user (even in combination with the blocking mechanism) was a sufficiently effective solution for 
such high risk processing. Additionally, the EDPB expresses serious doubts as to whether TTL has

on  the  TikTok  platform,  as  could  have  been  done  with  statistics  of  the  duration  between  the 
creation  of  an  account  by  a  user  under  13  years  of  age  and  the  subsequent  deletion  of  that 
account439.  

238. 

Considering  the  above  analysis,  the  EDPB  expresses  doubts  as  to  whether  the  ex  post 

measures implemented by TTL during the Relevant Period ensured a high level of effectiveness. 

Whether the technical and organisational measures implemented by TTL were ‘appropriate’ pursuant 
to Article 25(1) GDPR 

239. 

As a final step for the analysis, the EDPB will consider whether the age verification measures 
in  accordance  with 

implemented  by  TTL  during  the  Relevant  Period  were  appropriate 
Article 25(1) GDPR440. 

240. 

The  EDPB  further  notes  that,  in  order  to  be  considered  ‘appropriate’,  the  technical  and 
organisational measures for age verification chosen by controllers have to be compliant with the 
data  protection  principles  under  Article 5 GDPR,  for example the  principle  of  data minimisation 
under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, and need to fulfil other requirements of the GDPR.   

241.  When assessing whether the ex ante and ex post measures employed by the controller were, 
taking together and as a whole, appropriate for attaining the aim of preventing the children below 

                                                           
437 See paragraph 125 of this Binding Decision. 
438 Draft Decision, paragraphs 196-198.  
439  The  EDPB  notes  as  well  that  some  time  could  be  needed  to  perform  the  human  review  in  line  with 
Art. 22 GDPR, where relevant, which could be not due to an issue under Art. 22 GDPR, but the result of the ex 
post use of content moderation measures to remedy a shortcoming, i.e. the registration of a user with age below 
13, of the ex ante measures. 
440  In  this  regard  the  EDPB  takes  note  of  TTL’s  view  that  the  measures  implemented  need  to  lead  to  an 
appropriate level of effectiveness and certainty of assessing the age, and not an absolute level of certainty (TTL 
Art. 65 Submissions, paragraph 6.32). However, as evident from the assessment in the sub-section 5.4.2 of this 
Binding  Decision,  the  EDPB  is  assessing  the  measures  implemented  by  TTL  not  against  an  absolute  level  of 
certainty and effectiveness, but against an ‘appropriate’ level as envisaged in Article 25(1) GDPR.

13 years of age to use TikTok platform, the EDPB takes into account the standard set by the CJEU. 
While measures may not be sufficiently reliable to prevent all persons under the permitted age 
from being accepted, the measures needs to significantly reduce the likelihood of such acceptance 
that would exist if that method were not used441. The EDPB expresses serious doubts in relation to 
whether TTL provided sufficient evidence as required by Article 5(2) GDPR for the measures in place  
to demonstrate that it did ‘significantly reduce’ the likelihood of children under the age of 13 from 
accessing and using the TikTok platform. 

242. 

For the purposes of its assessment, the EDPB considers that the additional ex post measures 
in place by TTL do not as such prevent the registration of children under 13 years of age but instead 
mitigate shortcomings of the ex ante measures by removing accounts belonging to children under 
13 years of age when they are identified as such. In this regard, theoretically an ex post measure 
with a high enough level of accuracy and short enough delay in the removal of identified users 
could exist442. However, the EDPB has serious doubts if in the case at hand the ex post measures in 
place  provide  for  such  a  level  of  effectiveness  that  would  mitigate  the  shortcomings  indicated 
above of the ex ante measures443.  

Conclusion 

243. 

Taking  into  account  the  above,  the  EDPB  expresses  its  serious  doubts  regarding  the 
effectiveness of the age verification measures put in place by TTL during the Relevant Period, and 
more  specifically  regarding  whether  the  combination  of  the  ex  ante  and  ex  post  measures 
implemented by TTL were sufficient to bring the effectiveness to the level required in this specific 
case, considering the severity of the risks and the high number of vulnerable data subjects affected.  

244.  However,  taking  into  account  the  elements  available  to  the  EDPB  in  the  context  of  this 
procedure,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  it  lacks  conclusive  information  regarding  the  state  of  the  art 
element in relation to age verification during the Relevant Period444. Therefore, the EDPB does not 
have sufficient information, in particular in relation to the state of the art element, to conclusively 
assess TTL’s compliance with Article 25(1) GDPR. Consequently, the EDPB is not in a position to 
conclude that TTL infringed Article 25(1) GDPR.  

245. 

In light of the serious doubts expressed regarding the effectiveness of the measures chosen 
by TTL, the EDPB requires the IE SA to modify the conclusion set out in paragraph 221 of the Draft 
Decision in the IE SA’s final decision in the present case, by stating that it cannot be concluded in 
this case that the technical and organisational measures in respect of the age verification processes 
themselves  undertaken  by  TTL  during  the  Relevant  Period  infringed  the  GDPR  in  light  of  the 
measures  undertaken  and  the  extent  to  which  TTL  sought  to  ensure  its  platform  remained 
accessible only to those above the age of 13.  

246. 

As a final remark, the EDPB recalls that the appropriateness of the technical and organisational 
measures that need to be implemented to comply with Article 25(1) GDPR is, due to their link to 
the state of the art and the possible changes of the relevant risks, regularly changing over time. 
This is particularly relevant in the field of age verification. A controller therefore has to periodically

account  all  the  factors  under  Article  25(1)  GDPR,  considering  their  specific  case  at  hand,  in 
particular  the  level  of  risk.  In  addition,  controllers  need  to  ensure  that  any  measure  chosen  is

6  ON THE CORRECTIVE MEASURES 

  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

247. 

In the Draft Decision the IE SA envisages the imposition of corrective powers in connection to 
the  infringements  identified445,  in  particular:  an  order  to  bring  processing  operations  into 
compliance pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, and 
administrative fines446.  

248.  More specifically, concerning the envisaged order, the IE SA imposes an order to TTL to bring 
the relevant processing into compliance with Article 5(1)(c), Article 5(1)(f) and Article 25(1) and (2), 
and Articles 12(1) and Article13(1)(e) GDPR insofar as is still necessary within three months of the 
date of notification of any final decision447. The IE SA states that the relevant  provisions do not 
prescribe  a  particular  form  or  manner  of  processing  and  it  is  incumbent  on  TTL  to  ensure 
compliance448.  

249. 

Concerning  the  envisaged  reprimand,  the  IE SA  specifies  that 

is  ‘necessary  and 
proportionate  in  addition  to  the  order’  as  it  ‘formally  recognises  the  serious  nature  of  the 
infringements’ and ‘deter future similar non-compliance’449.

As to the administrative fines, the IE SA includes in the Draft Decision a range for the envisaged 
administrative fines to be imposed, respectively, for the infringement of Articles 5(1)(c) and 25(1) 
and  (2)  GDPR450,  for the  infringement of  Articles  5(1)(f)  and  Articles  25(1)  GDPR451,  and  for  the 
infringement of Articles 12(1) and 13(1)(e) GDPR452.

The EDPB notes that the compliance order and the reprimand already envisaged in the Draft 
Decision are not subject to objections of the CSAs and as such are not addressed in this Binding 
Decision.  

  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

252. 

The DE SAs raise the need to extend the compliance order envisaged by the IE SA in the Draft 
Decision to the additional infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR453. In 
the view of the DE SAs, the additional finding that TTL has breached Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by using 
dark  patterns  to  nudge  Child  Users  during  the  Relevant  Period454  has  a  direct  impact  on  the 
necessary administrative measures455. 

253. 

The DE SAs further explain the manner to bring the TTL’s processing into compliance, such as 
by underlying that TTL ‘has to eliminate all dark patterns and situations that nudge Child Users to 
decisions that violate their privacy, especially those named [in the DE SAs’ objection]’456. According 
to  the  DE SAs,  this  would  protect  a  considerable  number  of  data  subjects  from  (further) 
infringements of their rights457. 

254. 

Finally, the DE SAs state that leaving the Draft Decision unchanged poses a significant risk for 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of Child Users of the TikTok platform, as ‘the nudging by dark 
patterns leads them to make decisions with negative impact for the protection of their personal 
data (and therefore their fundamental rights and freedoms)’458. The DE SAs further raise that there 
are significant risks, considering TTL ‘is used by millions of users in Europe, including millions of 
children’459.  The  DE SAs  recall  that,  as  indicated  in  Recital  38  GDPR,  ‘children  merit  specific 
protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences 
and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of their personal data’460 
and ‘they are also more likely to be subject to dark patterns’461.  

255. 

The DE SAs further raise an objection on the need to adjust the administrative fine, which 
would need to be reassessed and set higher, due to the finding of an additional infringement of 
the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR462. According to the DE SAs, this is needed to 
ensure that the fine remains effective, proportionate and dissuasive463.

256. 

The IT SA in its objection requests to adapt the administrative fine, in connection with the 
alleged additional infringement of Article 25 GDPR464. The IT SA reasons that its objection relating 
to this  additional  infringement  should  clearly  impact  the corrective  measures envisaged465.  The

IT SA considers it necessary to impose an administrative fine, as referred to in Article 83(4)(a) GDPR 
for this additional infringement and in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 83(3) GDPR466. 
According to the IT SA, this fine would need to be on top of the fines already envisaged in the Draft 
Decision467. 

257. 

The IT SA argues that the assessment leading to the calculation of the fine needs to make it 
truly effective and dissuasive468. According to the IT SA, if the Draft Decision were left unchanged 
it  would  entail  significant  risks  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  of  the  data  subjects469.  If  the 
measures currently envisaged were retained, a high number of data subjects below the age of 13, 
would be exposed to risks of various nature470. In the view of the IT SA, this means that the rights 
of the data subjects would not be effectively protected and would incentivise the controller and 
other companies to continue committing such infringements471. 

  Position of the LSA on the objections 

258. 

Regarding  the  DE SAs’  objection  insofar  as  it  concerns  the  compliance  order,  the  IE SA 
questions  if  ‘the  proposed  order  to  bring  processing  into  compliance  would  satisfy  the 
requirements  of Recital 129 GDPR,  for binding measures to be  ‘clear and unambiguous’472. The 
IE SA argues that ‘the terms of the order proposed by the DE SAs are highly generalised in nature 
and do not identify, with any degree of specificity, what action the controller is required to take’473. 
Further, the IE SA questions the possibility ‘to enforce such an order against the controller in the 
event of perceived default’474.  

259. 

Regarding  the  DE SAs’  objection  insofar  as  it  concerns  the  administrative  fine,  the  IE SA 
highlights  that  ‘the  DE SAs  only  indicate  that  “the”  fine  should  be  “reassessed  and  set  higher”, 
however, the DE SAs’ objection does not indicate which of the three existing fining ranges should 
be reassessed’475. Further, it does not provide indications on how the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR 
should be considered476. Therefore, in the view of the IE SA, ‘it is impossible to envisage how the 
IE SA could follow the objection, whether it be on its own volition or following a binding decision 
by the EDPB’477.  

260. 

Additionally, the  IE SA argues  that the  DE SAs’ objection (in relation to both the  additional 
compliance  order  and  the  administrative  fine)  is  not  ‘relevant  and  reasoned’  because  ‘the 
corrective action element has not been adequately rationalised and does not address the risks to 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects’478.

261. 

Concerning the IT SA’s objection on the administrative fine, the IE SA is of the view that the 
IT SA failed to sufficiently engage with the criteria that should be considered for the imposition of 
a fine479. Instead, the IT SA limits itself to the nature of the infringement and the level of damages 
that was and may  be suffered480. The IE SA considers further that, considering all the extensive 
detail on a range of matters  that might  be  considered relevant  for the  purpose of Article 83(2) 
GDPR  in  the  Draft  Decision,  ‘it  is  unclear  why  the  IT SA  did  not  provide  sufficient  reasoning  to 
support this aspect of its objection’481. Lastly, according to the IE SA, such a high level approach 
makes it difficult to imagine how the IE SA could follow this aspect of the objection, whether it be 
on its own volition or based on a binding decision of the EDPB482. Additionally, the IE SA argues that 
the corrective action elements in the IT SA’s objection are not meeting the threshold set by Article 
4(24) GDPR as they have ‘not been adequately rationalised and do not adequately address the risks 
to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects’483.     

  Analysis of the EDPB 

6.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned  

262. 

The  EDPB  considers  that  the  objections  of  the  IT SA  and  the  DE SAs  relating  to  the 
administrative fine do not sufficiently elaborate the legal or factual arguments that would justify 
such a change in the Draft Decision. Additionally, concerning the DE SAs’ objection regarding the 
administrative fine, the EDPB is of the view that it does not sufficiently clearly demonstrate the 
significance of the risks that the Draft Decision poses to the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EEA. Consequently, the EDPB finds that the 
objections of the IT SA and DE SAs concerning the administrative fine are not sufficiently reasoned 
and thus do not meet the threshold stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR. 

*** 

263.  With regard to the DE SAs’ objection concerning the need to adjust the compliance order, it 

concerns ‘whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR’484.  

264. 

The DE SAs’ objection regarding the compliance order and its underlying reasoning is closely 
linked  to  the  DE SAs’  objection  requesting  the  IE SA  to  find  the  additional  infringement  of  the 
principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR485.  

265. 

The EDPB considers that the DE SAs’ objection has a direct connection with the Draft Decision. 
Indeed, for the demonstration that, in the context of the Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting 
Pop-Up, TTL implemented dark patterns resulting in non-compliance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the 
DE SAs’ objection relies upon the content and analysis included in the Draft Decision486. If followed, 
the DE SAs’ objection would lead to a different conclusion487, since the proposed order to bring

processing into compliance488 would be extended to encompass the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR. Therefore, the EDPB finds that the objection is relevant. 

266. 

The EDPB recalls the TTL’s general view that the DE SAs’ objection relating to the breach of 
the principle of fairness does not meet the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR as it raises a new 
issue, which is not within the scope of the Inquiry and should thus be rejected at the outset489. On 
this matter, the EDPB refers to its analysis in paragraph 67 above, where the EDPB also takes into 
account TTL’s views on this matter490.  

267. 

The EDPB takes note that TTL refers to the view that the DE SAs’ objection, insofar it concerns 
the  compliance  order,  is  formulated  in  vague  terms  and  lacks  specificity  on  what  action  the 
controller is required to take, thus it does not satisfy the requirements of Recital  129 GDPR for 
binding  measures  to  be  ‘clear  and  unambiguous’491.  The  EDPB  will  assess  below  if  the  DE SAs’ 
objection is adequately reasoned. In addition, the EDPB observes that TTL’s position also relates to 
the content of the objection, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility. 

268. 

 In their objection, the DE SAs put forward their reasoning, in addition to their reasoning on 
the existence of the additional infringement of fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR492, as 
to why the compliance order should be imposed in the case at hand. In particular, the DE SAs state 
that  the  legal  consequences  of  the  finding  that  TTL has  implemented  dark  patterns  have  to  be 
drawn  and  the  compliance  order  envisaged  in  the  Draft  Decision  should  be  amended,  as  ‘to 
eliminate  all  dark  patterns  and  situations  that  nudge  Child  Users  to  decisions  that  violate  their 
privacy’493. According to the DE SAs, it is needed to protect a considerable number of data subjects 
from (further) infringements of their rights494. Moreover, the DE SAs explain in their objection, as 
set out in paragraph 252 above, how the Draft Decision would need to be amended if the objection 
is followed495, i.e. the proposed order to bring processing into compliance would be extended to 
encompass the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. 

269. 

In consequence, the EDPB finds that the objection is sufficiently reasoned in respect of the 
request for the additional corrective measure requested in the DE SAs’ objection in this particular 
case, i.e. the order to bring processing into compliance under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR. 

270. 

Lastly, the DE SAs’ objection indicates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision 
if it were not to be amended. More specifically, the DE SAs state that leaving the Draft Decision 
unchanged poses a significant risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of Child Users of the 
TikTok  platform,  as  ‘the  nudging  by  dark  patterns  leads  them  to  make  decisions  with  negative 
impact  for  the  protection  of  their  personal  data  (and  therefore  their  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms)’496.  The  DE SAs  also  highlight  that  including  this  corrective  measure  would  protect  a 
considerable number of data subjects  from (further) infringements of their rights,  that children 
merit specific protection in light of Recital 38 GDPR and that they are more likely to be subject to

dark patterns497. Lastly, the DE SAs argue that ‘there is a risk that other social media providers, in 
case of the publication of the Draft Decision in its current version, could view this a, at least partial 
carte  blanche  for  using  nudging  and  dark  patterns’498.  In  this  respect,  the  EDPB  finds  that  the 
DE SAs’ objection clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks for the rights and freedoms of 
data subjects. 

271. 

Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the DE SAs’ objection concerning the compliance 
order in relation to the infringement by TTL of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 
is relevant and reasoned and therefore meets the threshold stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR. 

6.4.2 

 Assessment on the merits 

272. 

The  EDPB  considers  that  the  DE SAs’  objection  found  to  be  relevant  and  reasoned  in  this 
subsection499 require an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed in respect 
of the corrective measures proposed. More specifically, the EDPB needs to assess the request to 
expand  the  compliance  order  on  TTL500  in  order to  include  the  infringement of  the  principle  of 
fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR established above in Section 4.4.2501. When assessing the merits 
of the objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account TTL’s position on the objection and its 
submissions. 

273. 

The  EDPB  notes  that  TTL  submits  that  the  DE SAs’  objection  regarding  the  additional 
infringement lacks merit502 and that, in relation to the DE SAs’ request for the compliance order, 
TTL states that the objection is vague and lacks specificity on what action the controller is required 
to take503. TTL further submits that ‘the EDPB cannot direct the [LSA] to adopt specific corrective 
measures where the CSA has not particularised its direction’504. 

274. 

The  EDPB  recalls  that  when  a  violation  of  the  GDPR  has  been  established,  competent 
supervisory  authorities  are  required  to  react  appropriately  to  remedy  this  infringement  in 
accordance with the means provided to them by Article 58(2) GDPR505. According to Recital 129 
GDPR,  every  corrective  measure  applied  by  a  supervisory  authority  under  Article  58(2)  GDPR 
should  be  ‘appropriate,  necessary  and  proportionate  in  view  of  ensuring  compliance  with  the 
Regulation’  in  light  of  all  the  circumstances  of  each  individual  case.  CSAs  can  propose  in  their 
relevant and reasoned objections alternative or additional corrective measures to those envisaged 
in  the  Draft  Decision,  when  they  consider  that  the  envisaged  measures  do  not  meet  these 
requirements506.

275. 

Considering the conclusion on the additional infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR established 
in  Section  4.4.2  above,  as  well  as  the  type507  and  number  of  data  subjects  affected  by  this 
infringement508, the EDPB shares the view of the DE SAs509 that the corrective measure chosen in 
the circumstances of this case should aim to bring the TTL’s processing into compliance with the 
GDPR thus minimising the potential harm to data subjects created by the violation of the GDPR510.  

276. 

The  EDPB  considers  that,  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  and  bring  the  harm  to  the  data 
subjects to an end, in this particular case, it is appropriate, necessary and proportionate to amend 
the order to TTL to bring processing into compliance envisaged in the Draft Decision to include the 
TTL’s infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR511. This measure would 
require TTL, as proposed by the DE SAs in their objection512, to put in place the necessary technical 
and operational measures to achieve compliance, i.e. to eliminate the deceptive design patterns 
identified  in  paragraphs  109-113  and  114-116  of  this  Binding  Decision,  taking  into  account  the 
EDPB’s analysis in paragraphs 104-107 and 117-118 of this Binding Decision.  

277. 

The EDPB takes notes that the DE SAs’ objection does not identify a specific timeframe for 
such order, if it were to be imposed. The EDPB considers that the deadline for compliance with the 
order should be reasonable and proportionate, in light of the potential harms to the data subject 
rights and the resources available to the controller to achieve compliance. 

278. 

The EDPB recalls that compliance with the GDPR can be achieved in different manners and it 
is the controller’s responsibility to identify and implement the appropriate measures to bring its 
processing operations into compliance with the GDPR513. In the case at hand TTL has to remedy the 
infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by eliminating the deceptive 
design patterns in the context of the Registration Pop-Up514 and the Video Posting Pop Up515 of the 
TikTok platform. The EDPB however considers that in this particular case,  TTL is in a position to 
decide  the  most  suitable  manner  to  implement  the  compliance  order,  in  accordance  with  its 
accountability obligations516. 

279. 

Finally, the EDPB recalls that non-compliance with an order issued by a supervisory authority 
can be relevant both in terms of it being subject to administrative fines in line with Article 83(6) 
GDPR, and in terms of it being an aggravating factor for the imposition of administrative fines517. 
In addition, the investigative powers of supervisory authorities allow them to order the provision

508 DE SAs Objection, p. 7. 
509 DE SAs Objection, p. 8.  
510 C-311/18 Schrems II, paragraph 112: ‘Although the  supervisory authority must  determine which  action  is 
appropriate  and  necessary  and  take  into  consideration  all  the  circumstances  [...]  in  that  determination,  the 
supervisory authority is nevertheless required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully 
enforced with all due diligence’.

of  all the  information  necessary  for  the  performance  of  their  tasks  including  the  verification of 
compliance with one of their orders518.  

280. 

The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to expand the compliance order envisaged in its Draft 
Decision519 and to include in its final decision an order to TTL to bring its processing in the context 
of the Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop Up of the TikTok platform into compliance 
with the principle of fairness in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Specifically, TTL has to be 
ordered to eliminate the deceptive design patterns identified in paragraphs 109-113 and 114-116 
of this Binding Decision, taking into account the EDPB’s analysis in paragraphs 104-107 and 117-
118 of this Binding Decision, within the specified timeframe to be determined by the IE SA. 

7  BINDING DECISION 

281. 

In light of the above, and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR 
to  issue  binding  decisions  pursuant  to  Article 65 GDPR,  the  EDPB  issues  the  following  Binding 
Decision in accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. 

On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness 

282. 

The EDPB decides that the objection of the DE SAs, regarding the additional infringement by 
TTL of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) 
GDPR. 

283. 

The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an additional infringement by TTL 

of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in line with the analysis above. 

On the objection concerning the potential infringement of Article 25 GDPR 

284. 

The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA, regarding the existence of the infringement 

by TTL of Article 25 GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

285. 

The EDPB decides that, taking into account the elements available to the EDPB in the context 
of this procedure, it does not have sufficient information to conclusively assess TTL’s compliance 
with Article 25(1) GDPR in relation to the age verification measures implemented by TTL on the 
TikTok platform during the Relevant Period. 

286. 

In light of the serious doubts expressed regarding the effectiveness of the measures chosen 
by TTL, the EDPB requires the IE SA to modify the conclusion set out in paragraph 221 of the Draft 
Decision in the IE SA’s final decision in the present case, by stating that it cannot be concluded in 
this case that the technical and organisational measures in respect of the age verification processes 
themselves  undertaken  by  TTL  during  the  Relevant  Period  infringed  the  GDPR  in  light  of  the 
measures  undertaken  and  the  extent  to  which  TTL  sought  to  ensure  its  platform  remained 
accessible only to those above the age of 13. 

On the objection concerning the compliance order 

287. 

The  EDPB  decides  that  the  objection  of  the  DE SAs  on  the  order  to  bring  processing  into 
compliance with the GDPR under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR, in relation to the additional infringement

of  the  principle of  fairness  under  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  meets  the  requirements  of  Article  4(24) 
GDPR. 

288. 

The EDPB instructs the IE SA to expand the compliance order envisaged in its Draft Decision 
and  to  include  in  its  final decision  an order  to  TTL  to  bring  its  processing  in  the  context  of  the 
Registration Pop-Up and the Video Posting Pop Up of the TikTok platform into compliance with the 
principle of fairness in accordance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. 

On the objections concerning the administrative fine 

289. 

The EDPB decides that the relevant parts of the objections of the DE SAs and IT SA specifically 

relating to an administrative fine do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

8  FINAL REMARKS 

290. 

The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, 

in accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR.  

291. 

Regarding the objections deemed not to meet the requirements stipulated by Article 4(24) 
GDPR, the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised therein. 
The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB 
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account 
the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs. 

292. 

According  to  Article 65(6) GDPR,  the  IE SA  shall  adopt  its  final  decision  on  the  basis  of  the 
Binding Decision without undue delay and at the latest by one month after the EDPB has notified 
its Binding Decision.  

293. 

The  IE SA  shall  inform  the  EDPB  of  the  date  when  its  final  decision  is  notified  to  the 
controller520.  This  Binding  Decision  will  be  made  public  pursuant  to  Article 65(5) GDPR  without 
delay after the IE SA has notified its final decision to the controller521. 

294. 

The IE SA will communicate its final decision to the EDPB522. Pursuant to Article 70(1)(y) GDPR, 
the IE SA’s final decision communicated to the EDPB will be included in the register of decisions 
that have been subject to the consistency mechanism.
