Penalty for GDPR violation
In March of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Union Save Romania Party and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and b) in conjunction with art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).
As such, the Save Romania Union Party (USR) was fined 14,776.50 lei, (the equivalent of 3,000 EURO).
The sanction was applied as a result of notifications, forwarded by the People's Advocate institution, complaining that personal data belonging to people with different degrees of disability are posted on the website of the Union Save Romania Party.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the operator took personal data of some concerned persons, namely name, surname, CNP, address, series and ID number, medical expertise certificate number, degree of disability, from the official documents of authorities and public institutions, posted on their websites, later publishing them on the party's website, as part of a USR project, in violation of the principles of processing, without having a legal basis for that processing.
At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure to ensure compliance with GDPR principles when carrying out personal data processing operations, by reanalyzing the documentation published on the hcl.usr.ro website, which contains the decisions, provisions and minutes issued by local public authorities, in order to anonymize personal data.
