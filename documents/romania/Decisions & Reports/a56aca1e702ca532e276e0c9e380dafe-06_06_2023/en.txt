Penalty for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed, in May 2023, an investigation at the operator S.C. Apollo Salon S.R.L. and found the violation of the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
As such, the operator was penalized with a fine of 14,766.3 lei (equivalent to 3,000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a notification sent by a concerned person who complained that the operator S.C. Apollo Salon S.R.L. sends her unsolicited messages via SMS, on the phone, although she has repeatedly exercised her right to deletion, according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not communicate the requested information to the National Supervisory Authority, which represents a violation of the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
