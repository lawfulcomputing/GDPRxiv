Fine for GDPR violation

In November of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at an Owners' Association in Iași, to which it imposed a fine and a warning, as follows:

 fine in the amount of 2,462.5 lei, the equivalent of 500 EURO, for violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from GDPR;
 warning for violating the provisions of art. 6 in conjunction with paragraph 83. (5) lit. a) from the GDPR.

The investigation was carried out as a result of a complaint claiming that the operator displayed the payment lists containing the first and last name of each member of the Owners Association. The petitioner also complained about the display of a defamatory document in which his personal data (name and surname) were mentioned.
During the investigation, it was found that the Owners' Association disclosed the petitioner's personal data (name and surname) by displaying an information on the notice board, without his consent and without the existence of another situation where consent is not necessary.
The operator was also given the corrective measure to take the necessary measures in order to ensure the compliance of the processing operations with the provisions of the RGPD and to avoid the processing (including the disclosure) of personal data without the consent of the data subjects and without the existence of another situation in which the consent it is not necessary.
