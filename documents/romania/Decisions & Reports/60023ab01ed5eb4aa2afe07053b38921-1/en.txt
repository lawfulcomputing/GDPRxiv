Fine for GDPR violation

In October of the current year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator SC Das Sense Society SRL to which it imposed a fine, as a result of the fact that it did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 58 para.

As such, SC Das Sense Society SRL was penalized for contravention with a fine of 4,950 lei, the equivalent of 1000 EURO.
