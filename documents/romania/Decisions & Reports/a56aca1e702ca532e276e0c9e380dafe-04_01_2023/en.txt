Penalty for GDPR violation

In December 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Water Canal Ilfov SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b), art. 32 para. (2) and and art. 32 para. (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
As such, the operator was fined 14,757.60 RON (equivalent to 3000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a data security breach notification that was sent by the operator Apă Canal Ilfov SA.
During the investigation, it was found that the violation of data processing security occurred as a result of the fact that, in order to send an electronic message to the users registered on the company's online portal, the operator erroneously entered the e-mail addresses in the "To" section, in instead of "BCC".
Consequently, it turned out that this breach led to the unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data (e-mail address), so that a significant number of individuals were affected.
It was found that the operator Apa Canal Ilfov SA did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
