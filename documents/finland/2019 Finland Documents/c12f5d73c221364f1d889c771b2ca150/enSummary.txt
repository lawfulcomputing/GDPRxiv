 The controller and DPO helpline will go live on Tuesday, 1 October. In future, our current telephone support line will only serve private persons. The purpose of the change is to improve the availability of telephone support. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman's helpline will be open from 9.00 to 11.00 on weekdays, Monday through Friday. The helpline provides general advice and counselling on data protection and the processing of personal data. Only general advice can be provided; the helpline is unable to give detailed or binding comments on specific cases. The service is not intended for professional providers of consultancy, advocacy or legal services. Answers to the most common questions asked from the Data Protection Ombudsman are available on the website of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. The site also includes other instructions on data protection and the processing of personal data, for both private persons and organisations. Controller and DPO helpline: 029 56 66778 Telephone service for private persons: 029 56 66777 Additional information: Telephone service of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman
