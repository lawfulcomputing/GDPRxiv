 In the absence of an agreement between the EU and the UK, the UK will become a third country from 00.00 am CET on 30 March 2019. European Data Protection Board has published Information Note on data transfers under the GDPR in the event of a no-deal Brexit. As a consequence of no-deal Brexit, the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the UK will have to be based on one of the instruments mentioned in the chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation. 5 steps organisations should take to prepare for a no-deal Brexit:

Identify what processing activities will imply a personal data transfer to the UK
Determine the appropriate data transfer instrument for your situation
Implement the chosen data transfer instrument to be ready for 30 March 2019
Indicate in your internal documentation that transfers will be made to the UK
Update your privacy notice accordingly to inform individuals
