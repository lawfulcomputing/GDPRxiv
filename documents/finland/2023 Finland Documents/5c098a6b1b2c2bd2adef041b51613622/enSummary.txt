 The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has adopted Government ICT Centre Valtori's Turvalomake (Secure Form) service. The aim of the deployment is to improve the functionality and features of the Office's electronic forms. With this change, users can also use the forms to submit sensitive data. In addition, they will be able to save sent forms as PDF files for their own records in the Turvalomake service. Organisations can use the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman's forms to report personal data breaches, request prior consultations or submit the contact details of data protection officers. Individuals can submit requests concerning the exercise of the rights of the data subject as well as report faults in personal data processing. Previously, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman requested that sensitive and secret data be submitted by secure email. With this improvement, such data can now also be sent via Turvalomake. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman's forms are completed and sent securely to the Office. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman will send the client a message when the Office's registry has received the form. Sent forms can be saved as PDF files for personal use after submission.
