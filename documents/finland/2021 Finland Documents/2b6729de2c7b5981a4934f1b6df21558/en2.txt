The European Data Protection Board

Having regard to Article 70(1)(n) and Articles 40 and 41 of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(hereinafter “GDPR”),

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION:

1 INTRODUCTION

1. Regulation 2016/6791 (“the GDPR”) came into effect on 25 May 2018. One of the main objectives
of the GDPR is to provide a consistent level of data protection throughout the European Union and
to  prevent  divergences  hampering  the  free  movement  of  personal  data  within  the  internal
market.2 The GDPR also introduces the principle of accountability, which places the onus on data
controllers to be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.3
The provisions under Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR in respect of codes of conduct (“codes”)
represent a practical, potentially cost effective and meaningful method to achieve greater levels
of  consistency  of  protection  for  data  protection  rights.  Codes  can  act  as  a  mechanism  to
demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.4Notably, they can help to bridge the harmonisation gaps
that may exist between Member States in their application of data protection law.5 They also
provide an opportunity for particular sectors to reflect upon common data processing activities
and to agree to bespoke and practical data protection rules, which will meet the needs of the
sector as well as the requirements of the GDPR.6

1 The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.
2 See Recital 13 of the GDPR.
3 See Article 5(2) of the GDPR.
4 See for example Articles 24(3) and 28(5) and 32(3). A code of conduct may also be used by data processors to
demonstrate sufficient guarantees that their processing is compliant with the GDPR (See Article 28(5)).
5 See Recitals 77, 81, 98, 99, 148, 168 and Articles 24, 28, 35, 40, 41, 46, 57, 64, 70 of the GDPR. This is particularly
the case where a code relates to processing activities in several Member States.
6 Codes do not necessarily need to be confined or limited to a specific sector. For example, a code could apply to
separate sectors who have a common processing activity which share the same processing characteristics and
needs. Where a code is cross-sectoral in its application, more than one monitoring body may be appointed under
that code. However, where this is the case the code should make it absolutely clear as to the scope of that
monitoring body’s functions, in other words by specifying the sectors in respect of which each monitoring body
will perform its functions under Article 41 and the oversight mechanisms available to each monitoring body. In
this  regard,  the  relevant  sections  of  these  guidelines  which  set  out  the  responsibilities,  obligations  and

Adopted

2. Member States, Supervisory Authorities, the European Data Protection Board (“the Board”) and
the European Commission (“the Commission”) are obliged to encourage the drawing up of codes
to  contribute  to  the  proper  application  of  the  Regulation.7 These  guidelines  will  support  and
facilitate “code owners” in drafting, amending or extending codes.

1.1

Scope of these guidelines

3. The aim  of  these  guidelines  is  to  provide  practical  guidance  and  interpretative  assistance  in
relation to the application of Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR. They are intended to help clarify the
procedures and the rules involved in the submission, approval and publication of codes at both a
National and European level. They intend to set out the minimum criteria required by a Competent
Supervisory Authority (“CompSA”) before accepting to carry out an in depth review and evaluation
of a code.8 Further, they intend to set out the factors relating to the content to be taken into
account when evaluating whether a particular code provides and contributes to the proper and
effective application9 of the GDPR. Finally, they intend to set out the requirements for the effective
monitoring of compliance with a code.10

4. These  guidelines  should  also  act  as  a  clear  framework  for  all  CompSAs,  the  Board  and  the
Commission to evaluate codes in a consistent manner and to streamline the procedures involved
in the assessment process. This framework should also provide greater transparency, ensuring that
code owners who intend to seek approval for a code are fully conversant with the process and
understand the formal requirements and the appropriate thresholds required for approval.

5. Guidance on codes of conduct as a tool for transfers of data as per Article 40(3) of the GDPR will

be considered in separate guidelines to be issued by the EDPB.

6. All  codes  previously  approved11 will  need  to  be  reviewed  and  re-evaluated  in  line  with  the
requirements of the GDPR and then resubmitted for approval as per the requirements of Articles
40 and 41 and as per the procedures outlined in this document.

2 DEFINITIONS

‘Accreditation’ refers  to  the  ascertainment  that  the  proposed  monitoring  body  meets  the
requirements set out in Article 41 of the GDPR to carry out the monitoring of compliance with a
code  of  conduct.  This  check  is  undertaken  by  the  supervisory  authority  where  the  code  is

accreditation requirements in relation to monitoring bodies apply individually to each such monitoring body
appointed under the code.

submitted for approval (Article 41(1)). The accreditation of a monitoring body applies only for a
specific code.12
‘Code Owners’ refers to associations or other bodies who draw up and submit their code13 and
they will have an appropriate legal status as required by the code and in line with national law.
‘CompSA’ refers to the Supervisory Authority which is competent as per Article 55 of the GDPR.
‘Monitoring  body’ refers to a body/committee or a number of bodies/committees (internal or
external to the code owners14) who carry out a monitoring function to ascertain and assure that
the code is complied with as per Article 41.
‘Concerned SAs’ shall have the same meaning as per Article 4(22) of the GDPR
‘National code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities contained in one Member State.
‘Transnational code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities in more than one Member
State.

3 WHAT ARE CODES ?

7. GDPR codes are voluntary accountability tools which set out specific data protection rules for
categories of controllers and processors. They can be a useful and effective accountability tool,
providing a detailed description of what is the most appropriate, legal and ethical set of behaviours
of  a  sector.  From  a  data protection  viewpoint, codes can  therefore  operate as  a rulebook  for
controllers and processors who design and implement GDPR compliant data processing activities
which give  operational  meaning  to  the principles  of  data  protection  set  out  in  European  and
National law.

8. Trade associations or bodies representing a sector can create codes to help their sector comply
with the GDPR in an efficient and potentially cost effective way. As provided by the non-exhaustive
list contained in Article 40(2) of the GDPR, codes of conduct may notably cover topics such as:













fair and transparent processing;
legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts;
the collection of personal data; the pseudonymisation of personal data;
the information provided to individuals and the exercise of individuals’ rights;
the  information  provided  to  and  the  protection  of  children  (including  mechanisms  for
obtaining parental consent);
technical and organisational measures, including data protection by design and by default and
security measures;
breach notification;
data transfers outside the EU; or
dispute resolution procedures.

12 However, a monitoring body may be accredited for more than one code provided it satisfies the

requirements for accreditation.
13 As per Recital 98 of the GDPR.
14 See also Paragraphs 64– 67 below.

9. The  GDPR  in  repealing  the  Data  Protection  Directive  (95/46/EC)  provides  more  specific  and
detailed provisions around codes, the requirements which need to be met and the procedures
involved  in  attaining  approval,  as  well  as  their  registration,  publication  and  promotion  once
approved. Those provisions, in conjunction with these guidelines, will help encourage code owners
to  have  a  direct  input  into  the  establishment of data  protection  standards  and  rules  for  their
processing sectors.

10. It is important to note that codes are one of a number of voluntary tools that can be used from a
suite of data protection accountability tools which the GDPR offers, such as Data Protection Impact
Assessments  (DPIAs)15 and  Certification.16 They  are  a  mechanism  which  can  be  used  to  assist
organisations in demonstrating their compliance with the GDPR.17

4 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF CODES?

11. Codes  represent  an  opportunity  to  establish  a  set  of  rules  which  contribute  to  the  proper
application of the GDPR in a practical, transparent and potentially cost effective manner that takes
on board the nuances for a particular sector and/or its processing activities. In this regard codes
can be drawn up for controllers and processors taking account of the specific characteristics of
processing  carried  out  in  certain  sectors  and  the  specific  needs  of  micro,  small  and  medium
enterprises.18 They have the potential to be an especially important and beneficial tool for both
SMEs and micro enterprise businesses19 by providing a mechanism which allows them to achieve
data protection compliance in a more cost effective way.

For  example,  micro  enterprises  involved  in  similar  health research  activities  could  come
together  via  their  relevant  associations  and  collectively  develop  a  code  in  respect  of  their
collection  and  processing  of  health  data  rather  than  attempting  to  carry  out  such
comprehensive  data  protection  analysis  on  their  own.  Codes  will  also  benefit  supervisory
authorities by allowing them to gain a better understanding and insight of the data processing
activities of a specific profession, industry or other sector.

12. Codes can help controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR by governing areas such as
fair and transparent processing, legitimate interests, security and data protection by design and
default measures and controller obligations. Codes are accessible to all processing sectors and can

15 Codes of Conduct and Certification are voluntary accountability tools, whereas a DPIA will be mandatory in
certain circumstances. For further information on other accountability tools please see the general guidance
webpage of the EDPB (www.edpb.europa.eu).
16 See Article 42 of the GDPR and note the EDPB Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification
criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR.
17 Adherence  to  a  code  does  not,  of  itself,  guarantee  compliance  with  the  GDPR  or  immunity  for
controllers/processors from sanctions or liabilities provided under the GDPR.
18 See Recital 98 of the GDPR in respect of Article 40(1). For example, a code could be appropriately scaled to
meet the requirement of micro organisations in addition to small and medium enterprises.
19 Article 40(1) of the GDPR in particular identifies codes as a solution to address the needs of such enterprises.

be  drafted  in  as  narrow  or  as  wide-ranging  a  manner  as  is  befitting  that  particular  sector20,
provided that the code contributes to the proper and effective application of the GDPR.21

For example, approval could be sought for a set of rules in respect of how a specific charitable
sector would ensure its processing arrangements were fair and transparent. Alternatively, the
specific charitable sector could decide to draft a code, which incorporates and properly applies
a multitude of different provisions under the GDPR to cover all their processing activities, from
the  lawful  basis  for  the  collection of  personal  data  to  the  notification  of  personal  data
breaches.

13. Codes can provide a degree of co-regulation and they could decrease the level of reliance that
controllers and processors may sometimes place upon data protection supervisory authorities to
provide more granular guidance for their specific processing activities.

14. Codes can provide a degree of autonomy and control for controllers and processors to formulate
and  agree  best  practice  rules  for  their  given  sectors.  They  can  provide  an  opportunity  to
consolidate best practice processing operations in specific fields. They can also become a vital
resource that businesses can rely upon to address critical issues in their processing procedures and
to achieve better data protection compliance.

15. Codes can provide much needed confidence and legal certainty by providing practical solutions to
problems  identified  by  particular  sectors  in  relation  to  common  processing  activities.  They
encourage the development of a collective and consistent approach to the data processing needs
of a particular sector.

20 Article 40(2) of the GDPR refers to codes being prepared by representative organisations of ‘categories of
controllers  and  processors’.  Therefore  this  could  include  cross  sector  codes  where  practical provided the
representativeness criteria is met.
21 A narrowly focused code must make it sufficiently clear to data subjects (and to the satisfaction of a CompSA)
that  controllers/processors  adhering  to  the  code  does  not  necessarily  ensure  compliance  with  all  of  the
legislation. An appropriate safeguard in this instance could be to ensure adequate transparency regarding the
limited scope of the code to those signed up to the code and data subjects.

Adopted

16. Codes can be an effective tool to earn the trust and confidence of data subjects. They can address
a variety of issues, many of which may arise from concerns of the general public or even perceived
concerns from within the sector itself, and as such constitute a tool for enhancing transparency
towards individuals regarding the processing of their personal data.

For example, in the context of processing health data for research purposes, concerns over
the appropriate measures to be adopted in order to promote compliance with the rules
applying to the processing of sensitive health information could be allayed by the existence
of  an  approved  and  detailed  code.  Such  a  code  could  outline  in  a  fair  and  transparent
manner the following:















the relevant safeguards to be applied regarding the information to be provided to
data subjects;
relevant safeguards to be applied in respect of the data collected from third parties;
communication or dissemination of the data;
the  criteria  to be  implemented  to  ensure  respect  for  the  principle  of  data
minimisation;
the specific security measures;
appropriate retention schedules; and
the mechanisms to manage the data as a result of the exercise of data subjects'
rights (As per Articles 32 and 89 of the GDPR)

17. Codes may  also  provide  to  be  a  significant  and  useful  mechanism  in the  area  of  international
transfers. New provisions in the GDPR allow third parties to agree to adhere to approved codes in
order to satisfy legal requirements to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to international
transfers of personal data to third countries.22 Additionally, approved codes of this nature may
result in the promotion and cultivation of the level of protection which the GDPR provides to the
wider international community while also permitting sustainable legally compliant international
transfers of personal data. They may also serve as a mechanism which further develops and fosters
data subject trust and confidence in the processing of data outside of the European Economic
Area.23

18. Approved codes have the potential to act as effective accountability tools for both processors and
controllers. As outlined in Recital 77 and Article 24(3) of the GDPR, adherence to an approved code
of  conduct  is  envisaged,  amongst  others,  as  an  appropriate  method  for  a  data  controller  or
processor to demonstrate compliance with regard to specific parts or principles of the Regulation

22 See Article 40(2)(j) and Article 40(3) of the GDPR.
23 The  Board will  provide  separate  guidelines in  relation  to  the  use  of  codes  as  a  mechanism  to  facilitate
international transfers.

Adopted

10

or the Regulation as a whole.24 Adherence to an approved code of conduct will also be a factor
taken  into  consideration  by  supervisory  authorities  when  evaluating  specific  features  of  data
processing such as the security aspects25, assessing the impact of processing under a DPIA26 or
when  imposing  an  administrative  fine.27 In  case  of  a  breach  of  one  of  the  provisions  of  the
Regulation, adherence to an approved code of conduct might be indicative of how comprehensive
the need is to intervene with an effective, proportionate, dissuasive administrative fine or other
corrective measure from the supervisory authority.28

5 ADMISSIBILITY OF A DRAFT CODE29

19. There are a number of conditions to be met before a CompSA would be in a position to undertake
to fully assess and review a code for the purposes of Article 40(5) of the GDPR. They aim to facilitate
an efficient evaluation of any draft code. The following criteria apply:

5.1

Explanatory statement and supporting documentation

20. Every draft code which is submitted for approval must contain a clear and concise explanatory
statement, which provides details as to the purpose of the code, the scope of the code30 and how
it  will  facilitate  the  effective  application  of  this  Regulation.31 This  will  assist  in  expediting  the
process and in providing the requisite clarity to accompany a submission. The submission must
also  include  supporting  documentation,  where relevant,  to  underpin  the  draft  code  and
explanatory statement.32

5.2

Representative

21. A  code  must  be  submitted  by  an  association/consortium  of  associations  or  other  bodies
representing  categories  of  controllers  or  processors  (code  owners)  in  accordance  with  Article
40(2). A  non-exhaustive  list  of  example  of  possible  code  owners  would  include: trade  and
representative associations, sectoral organisations, academic organisations and interest groups.

22. The code owners must demonstrate to the CompSA that they are an effective representative body
and that they are capable of understanding the needs of their members and clearly defining the

24 See also Article 24(3) and 28(5) of the GDPR.
25 Article 32(3) of the GDPR.
26 Article 35(8) of the GDPR.
27 Article 83(2) (j) of the GDPR. Also note the application of codes in respect of WP 253/17 Guidelines on the
application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679 which was adopted
by the EDPB.
28 Ibid
29 This also applies for all codes (national and transnational) as well as amended or extended codes.
30 The following  non-exhaustive  categories  may  apply:  identification  of  members,  processing  activity,  data
subjects, types of data, jurisdictions, concerned SAs (Article 4(22) of the GDPR).
31 This document provides an opportunity for code owners to demonstrate the rationale and basis for approval
of their code. It provides a platform for code owners to outline the appropriateness of safeguards proposed and
to demonstrate that proposed mechanisms are fit for purpose.
32 Examples could include a consultation summary, membership information or research that demonstrates a
need for the code.

Adopted

11

processing activity or sector to which the code is intended to apply. Depending on the definition
and parameters of the sector concerned, representativeness can be derived amongst others from
the following elements:

 Number  or percentage of potential code members from the relevant controllers or processors

in that sector;
Experience  of  the  representative  body  with  regard  to  the  sector  and  processing  activities
concerning the code.



5.3

Processing Scope

23. The draft code must have a defined scope that clearly and precisely determines the processing
operations (or characteristics of the processing) of personal data covered by it, as well as the
categories of controllers or processors it governs. This will include the processing issues that the
code seeks to address and provide practical solutions.

5.4

Territorial scope

24. The draft code must specify whether it is a national or transnational code and provide details in
relation to territorial scope, identifying all relevant jurisdictions to which it intends to apply. For
any transnational codes (as well as amended or extended transnational codes), a list of concerned
SAs must be included. Appendix 1 outlines the distinction between national and transnational
codes.

5.5

Submission to a CompSA

25. The code owners must ensure that the supervisory authority chosen to review a draft code is
competent in accordance with Article 55 of the GDPR.33 Appendix 2 provides further information
which may assist code owners in choosing a CompSA for a transnational code.

5.6

Oversight of mechanisms

26. The draft code must propose mechanisms that allow for the monitoring of compliance with its
provisions by stakeholders who undertake to apply it.34 This applies to both public and non-public
sector codes.

5.7 Monitoring body

27. A draft code which involves processing activities of private, non-public authorities or bodies must
also identify a monitoring body and contain mechanisms which enable that body to carry out its

33 Article 55 of the GDPR states that each supervisory authority is competent for the performance of the tasks
assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with the Regulation on the territory of
its own Member State. Also see Recital 122 of the GDPR.
34 See Article 40(4) of the GDPR.

Adopted

12

functions as per Article 41 of the GDPR.35 The identified monitoring body or bodies must have the
appropriate standing to meet the requirements of being fully accountable in their role.36 To this
end, the monitoring body or bodies have to be accredited by the CompSA according to Article 41(1)
of the GDPR.37

5.8

Consultation

28. A draft code must contain information as to the extent of consultation carried out. Recital 99 of
the GDPR indicates when drafting a code (or amending/extending) a consultation should take place
with  the  relevant  stakeholders  including  data  subjects,  where  feasible. As  such,  code  owners
should confirm and demonstrate that an appropriate level of consultation has taken place with the
relevant stakeholders when submitting the code for approval. Where relevant, this will include
information about other codes of conduct that potential code members may be subject to and
reflect how their code complements other codes. This should also outline the level and nature of
consultation  which  took  place  with  their  members,  other  stakeholders  and  data  subjects  or
associations/bodies representing them.38 In practice, a consultation is highly recommended with
the members forming part of the organisation or body acting as the code owner and also taking
into account the processing activity with the clients of such members. Where no consultation has
been carried out with regard to relevant and specific stakeholders due to the lack of feasibility, it
will be a matter for the code owner to explain this position.

5.9

National legislation

29. Code owners must provide confirmation that the draft code is in compliance with relevant national
legislation, in particular, where the code involves a sector which is governed by specific provisions
set out in national law or it concerns processing operations that have to be assessed, taking into
account specific requirements and relevant legal obligations under national law.

5.10

Language

30. Code owners should comply with the language requirements of the CompSA to whom they will
submit their code. In general, a code should be submitted in the language of the CompSA of that
Member State.39 For transnational codes, the code should be submitted in the language of the
CompSA and also in English.40

5.11 Checklist

35 A code involving the public sector will still need to contain suitable mechanisms to monitor the code.
36 As per Article 83(4) (c) of the GDPR infringements in relation to the obligations of a monitoring body shall be
subject to an administrative fine.
37 See section below entitled ‘Accreditation Requirements for Monitoring Bodies’ on page 24.
38 For instance, codes owners could outline how they assessed the submissions received following consultation.
39 Some  Member  States  may  have  national  legislation  which  requires  a  draft  code  to  be  submitted  in  their
national language, and it is recommended that code owners explore this issue with the relevant CompSA in
advance of formally submitting their draft code for approval.
40 English is the working language of the EDPB as per Section 23 Rules of Procedure of the EDPB.

Adopted

13

31. Ultimately, it will be a matter for the chosen CompSA to determine whether the draft code goes
to the next stage of evaluation i.e. a CompSA undertakes to carry out a full assessment of the
content  in  line  with  Articles  40  and  41  of  the  GDPR  and  the  procedures  detailed  below.  The
Checklist  outlined  in Appendix  3 should  be  used  to  reference  documentation  submitted  to  a
CompSA and to help frame the submission of the draft code.

6 CRITERIA FOR APPROVING CODES

32. Code owners will need to be able to demonstrate how their code will contribute to the proper
application of the GDPR, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors
as well as the specific requirements and obligations of the controllers or processors to whom it
relates. There are a number of aspects to this overarching requirement. Code owners should be
able to demonstrate that their draft code:

 meets a particular need of that sector or processing activity,





facilitates the application of the GDPR,
specifies the application of the GPDR,
provides sufficient safeguards41, and
provides effective mechanisms for monitoring compliance with a code.

6.1 Meets a particular need

33. Code owners are required to demonstrate a need for the establishment of a code.  As such a code

must address data protection issues which arise for a particular sector or processing activity.

For example, the sector of information systems for the detection of consumer credit risks may identify
a need to formulate a code which provides sufficient safeguards and mechanisms to ensure that the
data collected are relevant, accurate and are used exclusively for the specific and legitimate purpose of
protecting credit. Similarly, the health research sector may identify a need to formulate a code which
provides consistency in approach by setting out standards to adequately meet explicit consent and
accompanying accountability requirements under the GDPR.

34. Code owners should be able to explain and set out the problems the code seeks to address and
substantiate how the solutions the code offers will be effective and beneficial not only for their
members but also for data subjects.

6.2

Facilitates the effective application of the GDPR

41 For example, ‘high risk’ sectors, such as processing children’s or health data would be expected to contain
more robust and stringent safeguards, given the sensitivity of the personal data in question.

Adopted

14

35. As per recital 98 of the GDPR, a code, in order to attain approval, will require code owners to be
able demonstrate that their code facilitates the effective application of the GDPR. In this regard, a
code  will  need  to clearly stipulate  its  sector-specific  application  of  the  GDPR and  identify  and
address such specific needs of a sector.42

For example, providing a list of definitions that are specific to the sector as well as an adequate focus on
topics that are particularly relevant to the sector are ways to facilitate the effective application of the
GDPR. Using sector-specific terminology to detail the implementation of the requirements of the GDPR
in the sector may also improve the clear understanding of the rules by the industry and thus facilitate
the effective application of the GDPR. A code should fully take into account the likely risks involved with
a particular sector processing activity and appropriately calibrate the related obligations of controllers
or processors to whom it applies in light of those risks in that specific sector i.e. providing  examples of
acceptable terms and conditions in relation to the use of personal data in direct marketing. In terms of
format, the content of the code should also be presented in a way that facilitates its understanding,
practical use and effective application of the GDPR.

6.3 Specifies the application of the GDPR

36. Codes will need to specify the practical application of the GDPR and accurately reflect the nature
of  the  processing  activity  or  sector.  They  should  be  able  to  provide  clear  industry  specific
improvements in terms of compliance with data protection law. Codes will need to set out realistic
and attainable standards for all their members, and they will need to be of a necessary quality and
internal consistency to provide sufficient added value.43 In other words, a draft code will need to
be adequately focused on particular data protection areas44 and issues in the specific sector to
which it applies and it will need to provide sufficiently clear and effective solutions to address those
areas and issues.45

37. A code should not just re-state the GDPR.46 Instead, it should aim to codify how the GDPR shall
apply in a specific, practical and precise manner. The agreed standards and rules will need to be
unambiguous, concrete,  attainable  and enforceable  (testable).  Setting out  distinct  rules  in the
particular field is an acceptable method by which a code can add value. Using terminology that is
unique and relevant to the industry and providing concrete case scenarios or specific examples of
‘best practice’47 may help to meet this requirement.48

42 See Article 40(1) of the GDPR.
43 This standard was first applied in WP 13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
44 Such as those listed in Article 40(2) of the GDPR.
45 This requirement reflects the previous position of the WP 29 as outlined in Working Document on Codes WP
13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
46 Providing restatements of data protection law was a regular feature of unsuccessful draft codes which were
submitted for approval to WP 29.
47 And ‘unacceptable practices’.
48 A code should avoid, where possible, being overly legalistic.

Adopted

15

38. Outlining plans to promote the approved code so individuals are informed of its existence and
contents may also assist in reaching the standard of “specifying the application of the GDPR”. It is
vital that codes are able to provide operational meaning to the principles of data protection as
articulated in Article 5 of the GDPR. It is also vital that codes properly take into account relevant
opinions and positions published or endorsed by the Board to that particular sector or processing
activity.49 For example, codes containing specifications with regard to processing activities, might
also facilitate the identification of adequate legal grounds for these processing activities in the
Member States to which they intend to apply.

6.4 Provides sufficient safeguards

39. A code should also meet the requirements of Article 40(5). Approval will only be forthcoming when
it is determined that a draft code provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.50 Codes owners will
need to appropriately satisfy a CompSA that their code contains suitable and effective safeguards
to mitigate the risk around data processing and the rights and freedoms of individuals.51 It will be
a matter for the code owners to provide clear evidence showing that their code will meet these
requirements.

For example, in ‘high risk’ processing activities such as the large scale processing of children’s or health
data,  profiling  or  systematic  monitoring,  it  would  be  expected  that  the  code  would  contain  more
demanding requirements upon controllers and processors to reflect an adequate level of protection.
Additionally, code owners may benefit from carrying out a more extensive consultation as per Recital 99
of the GDPR to underpin a code involving the processing of such high risk areas.

6.5 Provides mechanisms which will allow for effective oversight

40. As per Article 40(4) of the GDPR, a code requires the implementation of suitable mechanisms to
ensure  that  those  rules  are  appropriately  monitored  and  that  efficient  and  meaningful
enforcement measures are put in place to ensure full compliance. A code specifically needs to
identify  and  propose  structures  and  procedures  which  provide  for  effective  monitoring  and
enforcement of infringements. A draft code will also need to identify an appropriate body which
has at its disposal mechanisms to enable that body to provide for the effective monitoring of
compliance with the code. Mechanisms may include regular audit and reporting requirements,
clear and transparent complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures, concrete sanctions
and remedies in cases of violations of the code, as well as policies for reporting breaches of its
provisions.

49 They will also need to fully take on board relevant National and European jurisprudence.
50 See Recital 98 of the GDPR.
51 Safeguards may also apply to monitoring bodies and their capabilities in carrying out their role in an effective
manner.

Adopted

16

41. A draft code will be required to have a monitoring body where it involves processing carried out
by non-public authorities and bodies. In essence, a code must not only consider the contents of
rules  applicable  to  that  sector’s processing  activity,  but  it  must  also  implement  monitoring
mechanisms which will  ensure  the  effective  application  of  those  rules.  A  draft  code  could
successfully  propose  a  number  of  different  monitoring  mechanisms  where  there  are  multiple
monitoring bodies to carry out effective oversight. However, all proposed monitoring mechanisms
as to how to give effect to adequate monitoring of a code will need to be clear, suitable, attainable,
efficient  and  enforceable  (testable).  Code  owners  will  need  to  set  out  the  rationale  and
demonstrate why their proposals for monitoring are appropriate and operationally feasible.52

7 SUBMISSION, ADMISSIBILITY AND APPROVAL53 (NATIONAL CODE)

7.1

Submission

42. Code  owners  should  formally  submit  their  draft  Code  in  either  an  electronic  or  written
(printed/hard  copy) format  to  the  CompSA.54 The  CompSA  will  revert  to  the  code  owners
acknowledging receipt of the submission, and proceed to carry out a review as to whether the
draft code meets the admissibility criteria as set out above55 before proceeding to carry out a full
evaluation of its contents.

7.2

Admissibility of a Code

43. If the draft Code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the criteria for admissibility56 the
CompSA will respond to the code owners in writing outlining the basis for its decision. The process
would come to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the
code owners.57

44. If the draft code meets the criteria set out above, the CompSA should write to the code owners
with confirmation that it will proceed to the next stage of the process and assess the draft code’s
content in accordance with the relevant procedures provided under national law.

7.3

Approval

52 The Article 29 Working Party document “Judging industry self-regulation: when does it make a meaningful
contribution  to  the  level  of  data  protection  in  a  third  country?”  WP7  adopted  14  January  1998  is  also  an
informative  document  providing  further  insight  into  assessing  the  value  of  a  code  and  the  general  grounds
required for it to be effective. It is recommended that this document is also considered (where relevant) when
formulating a code.
53 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.
54 Obviously such an authority will be the National SA for the members to whom the code applies. It is also
important that code owners clearly stipulate to the CompSA that they are formally submitting a draft Code for
approval  and  that  they  clearly  indicate  the  jurisdictional scope  of  the  code.  Also  please  note Appendix  1  in
relation to the distinction between national and transnational codes.
55 See also Appendix 3 checklist.
56 Ibid
57 It is worth noting that refusal at this stage of the approval process will most likely be based on general or
procedural preliminary requirements rather than substantive or core issues associated with the provisions of the
draft code.

Adopted

17

45. Unless a specific timeline is prescribed under national law, the CompSA should draft an opinion
within a reasonable period of time and it should keep the draft owners regularly updated on the
process and indicative timelines. The opinion should outline the basis for its decision in line with
the criteria for approval as outlined above.58

46. If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse approval, then the process will be completed and
it will be a matter for the code owners to assess the findings of the opinion and reconsider the
draft code on that basis. It would also be necessary for the code owners to formally re-submit an
updated draft code at a later stage, if they choose to do so.

47. If the CompSA approves a draft code, it will be necessary for it to register and publish the code (via
its website and/or other appropriate methods of communication).59 Article 40(11) also requires
the Board to make publicly available all approved codes.

8 SUBMISSION, ADMISSIBILITY AND APPROVAL60 (TRANSNATIONAL

CODE)

8.1

Submission

48. Code owners should formally submit their draft code in either an electronic or written format to a
CompSA which will act as the principal authority for the approval of the code.61 The CompSA will
revert to the code owners acknowledging receipt of the documentation and proceed to carry out
a  review  as  to  whether  the  draft  code  meets  the  requirements  as  set  out  above62 before
proceeding to carry out a full evaluation of its contents. The CompSA will immediately notify all
other supervisory authorities of the submission of a code and provide the salient details which will
allow for ease of identification and reference. All supervisory authorities should confirm by return
whether they are concerned SAs as per Article 4(22) (a) and (b) of the GDPR.63

8.2

Admissibility of a Code

49. If the draft code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the admissibility criteria set out
above, the CompSA will write to the code owners outlining the basis for its decision. The process

58 By doing so the CompSA can provide helpful feedback to code owners if they choose to review, amend and re-
submit a draft code at a future date.
59 As per Article 40(6) of the GDPR.
60 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.
61 This should be read in the context of the procedure outlined below.
62 See also Appendix 3 checklist.
63 This is important as it is envisaged that co-reviewers of the draft code would be supervisory authorities which
are  concerned  by  the  processing  of  personal  data  because  the  controller  or  processor  is  established  on  the
territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority or because “data subjects residing in the Member
State  of  that  supervisory  authority  are  substantially  affected  or  likely  to  be  substantially  affected  by the
processing”.

Adopted

18

will come to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the code
owners.64 The CompSA will also issue a notification updating all concerned SAs of the position.

50. If the draft code is accepted by the CompSA on the basis of meeting the admissibility criteria, the
CompSA should write to the code owners with confirmation that they will proceed to the next
stage of the process and assess the draft code’s content. This will trigger the following informal
cooperation procedure in respect of assessing the code for approval.

8.3

Cooperation

51. The CompSA will issue a notification updating all SAs65 of the position, identifying concerned SAs
and they will make a request seeking, on a voluntary basis, a maximum of two co-reviewers to
assist with the substantive assessment of the draft code.  The appointment of co-reviewers will be
made on a first come basis.66 The role of co-reviewers will be to assist the CompSA in assessing the
draft code. Once the co-reviewers are confirmed, comments from them on the content of the code
should be provided within thirty days from their confirmation as co-reviewers. These comments
will then be considered by the CompSA when carrying out its assessment for approval. As per
Article 40(7) of the GDPR, the CompSA will make the final determination as to whether the draft
decision should be submitted to the Board as per Articles 63 and 64 of the GDPR.67

52. The CompSA should aim to arrive at a decision within a reasonable period of time, and it should
keep the code owners regularly updated on the progress and indicative timelines. It should outline
the basis for its decision (to refuse or to approve a code) in line with the general grounds for
approval and communicate that decision in a timely manner to the code owners.

8.4

Refusal

53. If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse referring a draft code to the Board the process
will come to an end and it will be a matter for the code owners to analyse the findings of the
decision and reconsider revising their draft code. It would also be necessary for the code owners
to resubmit the code for an approval at a later stage, if they choose to do so. The CompSA should
also notify all concerned SAs of its position and reasons for refusing to approve a code.

8.5

Preparation for submission to the Board

54. If the CompSA aims to approve the draft code, before submission to the EDPB, the CompSA will
circulate its draft approval to all concerned SAs. All concerned SAs will have 30 days to respond

64 It is worth noting that refusal at this stage of the approval process will most likely be based on general or
procedural preliminary requirements rather than substantive or core issues associated with the provision of the
draft code.
65 Concerned SAs should be identifiable from the scope of the draft code.
66 This request will remain open for ten working days. While co-reviewers are being identified, the CompSA will
proceed with the assessment. As a rule, the CompSA will consult two co-reviewers whenever 14 Member States
or more are concerned by the code. Under this threshold it is possible to have one or two co-reviewers depending
on the specific case.
67 This can only occur where the CompSA aims to approve the draft code. See Article 40(7) and Article 64(1).

Adopted

19

and any significant issues could be brought to the relevant EDPB subgroup for discussion. If the
concerned SAs do not respond, the code will proceed to the next stage of the process.

8.6

The Board

55. If the decision is to refer the matter to the Board as per Article 40(7) of the GDPR. The CompSA will
communicate  that  decision  to  all  supervisory  authorities  as  per  the  consistency mechanisms
procedure.68 The CompSA will also refer the matter to the Board in line with its rules of procedure
and Article 40(7) of the GDPR.

56. Under Article 64 the Board shall issue an opinion pertaining to matters outlined in Article 40(7) of
the GDPR.69 The Rules of Procedure of the Board together with the provisions of Article 64 will
apply  to  the  Board  and  the  CompSA  when  conducting  an  assessment  and  communicating  a
decision on the approval of transnational codes.

8.7

Approval

57. The opinion of the Board will be communicated to the CompSA as per Article 64(5) of the GDPR
and it will be a matter for the CompSA as to whether it will maintain or amend its draft decision as
per Article 40(5).70 An Opinion of the Board may also be submitted to the Commission pursuant to
Article 40(8) and the Board, under Article 40(11), will collate all approved transnational codes and
make them publicly available.

9 ENGAGEMENT

58. It is important to note that the assessment process should not serve as an opportunity to further
consult on the provisions of the submitted code with the CompSA. The CompSA is tasked, under
Article 40(5), to provide an opinion on whether the draft code complies with the GDPR.71 As such,
the communication envisaged between the CompSA and the code owners during this stage of the
process will be primarily for the purposes of clarification and to assist in carrying out an evaluation
under  Article  40  and  41.  It  is  anticipated  that  code  owners  will  liaise,  as  appropriate,  with
supervisory authorities in advance of submitting their draft code for approval.  In principle, the
approval  stage  of  the  process  should  not  invite  further  consultation  by  the  code  owners  on
particular provisions in the draft code nor should it allow for an extended assessment whereby
amendments are continually submitted to the CompSA. It is also imperative that code owners are
available to provide answers on points of clarification in respect of their draft code and  that they
are capable of doing so within a reasonable period of time. It is important that the code owners
are prepared and organised to address queries in an efficient and able manner. It is recommended
that a single or dedicated point of contact is provided to the CompSA. It will be at the discretion of

68 See Article 64(4) of the GDPR according to which the views of other supervisory authorities concerned should
be presented along with the draft CompSA decision.
69 See task of Board as per Article 70 (1)(x) of the GDPR.
70 See Article 64(7) and note the procedures invoked if a CompSA disagrees with the Board’s opinion as per Article
64(8) of the GDPR.
71 The CompSA may also advise and, where relevant, make recommendations to code owners in relation to the
content and format of its draft code.

Adopted

20

the CompSA as to whether it needs further information before making its decision on the draft
code and it will also have discretion to determine the manner of any communication between the
parties.  For  the  purposes of  continuity,  the  CompSA  will  also  remain  as  the  principal  point of
contact during the entire approval process for transnational codes.

10 THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION

59. The Commission may decide by way of an implementing Act that an approved transnational code
will have general validity within the Union and shall ensure appropriate publicity if it were to do
so.72

11 MONITORING OF A CODE

60. In order for a code (national or transnational) to be approved, a monitoring body (or bodies), must
be identified as part of the code and accredited by the CompSA as being capable of effectively
monitoring  the  code.73 The  CompSA  will  submit its draft  requirements  for  accreditation  of  a
monitoring body to the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 of
the GDPR. Once approved by the Board the requirements can then be applied by the CompSA to
accredit a monitoring body.

61. The GDPR does not define the term ‘accreditation’. However, Article 41(2) of the GDPR outlines
general  requirements  for  the  accreditation  of  the  monitoring  body.  There  are  a  number  of
requirements which should be met in order to satisfy the CompSA to accredit a monitoring body.
Code owners will need to explain and demonstrate how their proposed monitoring body meets
the requirements set out in Article 41(2) to obtain accreditation.

62. The GDPR provides flexibility around the type and structure of a monitoring body to be accredited
under Article 41. Code owners may decide to use external or internal monitoring bodies provided
that  in  both  cases  the  relevant  body meets  the  accreditation  requirements  of  Article 41(2)  as
outlined in the eight requirements listed below.

12 ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MONITORING BODIES

12.1 Independence

63. The code owners will need to demonstrate that the body concerned is appropriately independent
in relation to its impartiality of function from the code members and the profession, industry or
sector to which the code applies. Independence could be evidenced through a number of areas

72 See Article 40(9) and Article 40(10). Such a decision would also permit controllers and processors that are not
subject to the GPDR to make binding and enforceable  commitments regarding a  validated code (See Article
40(3)).  This  would  allow  data  transfers to  third  countries  or  international  organisations  on  the  basis that
appropriate safeguards are in place and rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects (See
also Article 46(1) and 46(2)(e)).
73 GDPR Article 41 (1). Also note that Article 41 does not apply to public authorities or bodies.

Adopted

21

such as the monitoring body’s funding, appointment of members/staff, decision making process
and more generally in terms of its organisational structure. These are considered in more detail
below.

64. There are two main models of monitoring which could be used by code owners for fulfilling the
monitoring body requirements: external and internal monitoring body. There is some flexibility
within these two types of monitoring approaches and different versions could be proposed which
are  appropriate  given  the context  for the  code.  Examples of  internal monitoring  bodies  could
include an ad hoc internal committee or a separate, independent department within the code
owner. It will be for the code owners to explain the risk management approach with regard to its
impartiality and independence.

65. For instance, where an internal monitoring body is proposed, there should be separate staff and
management,  accountability  and  function  from other  areas  of  the  organisation.  This  may  be
achieved in a number of ways, for example, the use of effective organisational and information
barriers and separate reporting management structures for the association and monitoring body.
Similar  to  a  data  protection  officer,  the  monitoring  body  should  be  able  to  act  free  from
instructions and shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or
indirect) as a consequence of the fulfilment of its task.

66. Independence could require that an external counsel or other party having participated in the
drafting  of  the  code  of  conduct,  would  need  to  demonstrate  that  there  were  appropriate
safeguards in place to sufficiently mitigate a risk of independence or a conflict of interest. The
monitoring body would need to provide evidence as to the appropriateness of the mechanisms
which would satisfactorily identify and mitigate such risks.74A monitoring body will need to identify
risks to its impartiality on an ongoing basis, such as its activities or from its relationships. If a risk
to impartiality is identified, the monitoring body should demonstrate how it removes or minimises
such risk and uses an appropriate mechanism for safeguarding impartiality.

67. Independence could also be demonstrated by showing full autonomy for the management of the
budget  and  other  resources,  in  particular  in  cases  where  the  monitoring  body  is  internal.  A
monitoring body would also need to be able to act independently in its choice and application of
sanctions against a controller or processor adhering to the code. In essence, the body - either
internal or external - will need to act independently from code owners and members within the
scope of the code in performing its tasks and exercising its powers.

12.2 Conflict of interest75

68. It will need to be demonstrated that the exercise of the monitoring body’s tasks and duties do not
result in a conflict of interests. As such, code owners will need to demonstrate that the proposed
monitoring body will refrain from any action that is incompatible with its tasks and duties and that

74 The context for the code will determine the approach to take. For example, a proposal where there is an
adequate separation of duties, whereby the monitoring body personnel did not write, pilot or test the code may
suffice.
75 Impartiality of function, i.e. the ability to act autonomously.

Adopted

22

safeguards  are  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  will  not  engage  with  an  incompatible  occupation.
Similarly,  the  monitoring  body  must  remain  free  from  external  influence,  whether  direct  or
indirect, and shall neither seek nor take instructions from any person, organisation or association.
The body should have its own staff which are chosen by them or some other body independent of
the code and it should be subject to the exclusive direction of those bodies only. In the case of an
internal monitoring body, it shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether
direct  or  indirect)  by  the  code  owner,  other  relevant  bodies,76 or  members  of  the  code  as  a
consequence of the fulfilment of its tasks.

12.3 Expertise

69. The code owners will need to be able to demonstrate that the monitoring body has the requisite
level of expertise to carry out its role in an effective manner. As such, the submission will need to
include details as to the knowledge and experience of the body in respect of data protection law
as  well  as  of  the  particular  sector  or  processing  activity.  For  example,  being  able  to  point  to
previous experience of acting in a monitoring capacity for a particular sector may assist in meeting
this requirement. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of data protection issues and expert
knowledge of the specific processing activities which are the subject matter of the code will be
welcomed. The staff of the proposed monitoring body should also have appropriate operational
experience  and  training  for  carrying  out  the  monitoring  of  compliance  such  as  in  the  field  of
auditing, monitoring, or quality assurance activities.

12.4 Established procedures and structures

70. A monitoring body will also need to have appropriate governance structures and procedures which

allow it to adequately:





assess for eligibility of controllers and processors to apply the code;
to monitor compliance with its provisions; and
to carry out reviews of the code’s operation.

71. Comprehensive vetting procedures should be drafted which adequately assess the eligibility of
controllers and processors to sign up to and comply with the code. It should also ensure that the
provisions of the code are capable of being met by the controllers and processors.

72. Procedures and structures to actively and effectively monitor compliance by members of the code
will be required. These could include random or unannounced audits, annual inspections, regular
reporting and the use of questionnaires.77The monitoring procedures can be designed in different
ways as long as they take into account factors such as the risks raised by the data processing in
scope of the code, complaints received or specific incidents and the number of members of the
code etc. Consideration could be given to the publication of audit reports as well as to the findings
of periodic reporting from controllers and processors within the scope of the code.

76 Bodies who represent categories of controllers or processors.
77 This could also help prevent a situation whereby members are monitored repeatedly while others are not.

Adopted

23

73. Code owners will also need to demonstrate that the proposed monitoring body have adequate
resources  and  staffing  to  carry  out  its  tasks  in  an  appropriate  manner.  Resources  should  be
proportionate to the expected number and size of code members, as well as the complexity or
degree of risk of the relevant data processing.

12.5 Transparent complaints handling

74. A monitoring body will need to establish effective procedures and structures which can deal with
complaints handling in an impartial and transparent manner. As such, it needs to have a publicly
accessible complaints handling process which is sufficiently resourced to manage complaints and
to ensure that decisions of the body are made publicly available.

For example, evidence of a complaints handling procedure could be a described process to
receive,  evaluate,  track,  record  and  resolve  complaints.  This  could  be  outlined  in  publicly
available  guidance  for  the  code  so  that  a  complainant  can  understand  and  follow  the
complaints process. Furthermore, the independence of such processes could be assisted by
separate operational staff and management functions in the monitoring body.

75. Monitoring bodies should also have effective procedures to ensure compliance with the code by
controllers or processors. An example would be to give the monitoring body powers to suspend or
exclude a controller or processor from the code when it acts outside the terms of the code (i.e.
corrective measures).

76. If a code member breaks the rules of the code, the monitoring body is obliged to take immediate
suitable measures. The aim of suitable corrective measures will be to stop the infringement and to
avoid future recurrence. Such remedial actions and sanctions could include such measures ranging
from training to issuing a warning, report to the Board of the member, a formal notice requiring
the implementation of specific actions within a specified deadline, temporary suspension of the
member from the code until remedial action is taken to the definitive exclusion of such member
from the code. These measures could be publicised by the monitoring body, especially where there
are serious infringements of the code.

77. Where required, the monitoring body should be able to inform the code member, the code owner,
the CompSA and all concerned SAs about the measures taken and its justification without undue
delay.78 Moreover, in the case where a Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA)79 for a transnational code
member is identifiable, the monitoring body should also appropriately inform the LSA as to its
actions.

12.6 Communication with the competent supervisory authority

78 If the monitoring is carried out by a body outside the association/body that submits the code of conduct, the
code owner should also be informed.
79 Pursuant to Art. 56 of the GDPR.

Adopted

24

78. A proposed monitoring body framework needs to allow for the effective communication of any
actions carried out  by  a monitoring  body  to  the  CompSA  and other  supervisory  authorities  in
respect  of  the  code.  This  could  include  decisions  concerning  the  actions  taken  in  cases  of
infringement of the code by a code member, providing periodic reports on the code, or providing
review or audit findings of the code.80

79. In addition, it will need to ensure that the supervisory authority is not prejudiced or impeded in its
role. For example, a code which proposes that its members can unilaterally approve, withdraw or
suspend a monitoring body without any notification and agreement with the CompSA would be in
contravention of Article 41(5) of the GDPR.

12.7 Review Mechanisms

80. A  code  will  need  to set out  appropriate  review mechanisms  to  ensure that  the  code  remains
relevant and continues to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR. Review mechanisms
should also be put in place to adapt to any changes in the application and interpretation of the law
or where there are new technological developments which may have an impact upon the data
processing carried out by its members or the provisions of the code.

12.8 Legal status

81. The proposed monitoring body (whether internal or external) and related governance structures
will need to be formulated in such a manner whereby  the code owners can demonstrate that the
monitoring  body  has  the  appropriate  standing  to  carry  out  its  role  under  Article  41(4)  and  is
capable of being fined as per Article 83(4)(c) of the GDPR.

13 APPROVED CODES

82. Clearly the nature and content of the code will determine the roles of the relevant stakeholders in
terms of ensuring compliance with the code and the GDPR. However, the CompSA will continue to
have a role in ensuring the code remains fit for purpose.

83. The  CompSA  will  therefore  work  closely  with  the  monitoring  body  in  terms  of  the  reporting
requirements  arising  from  the  code.    The  monitoring  body  will  act  as  the  lead  contact  and
coordinator in terms of any issues which may arise in relation to the code.

84. The CompSA would also approve any further amendments or extensions to the code and accredit
any new monitoring bodies.81 As per Article 40(5) of the GDPR, any amendment or extension of an
existing code will also have to be submitted a CompSA in line with the procedures outlined in this
document.

80 See Article 41(4).
81 Amendments  requiring  approval,  for  example,  could  include  adding  a  new  code  rule,  but  not  updating  a
reference to the name of an organisation, or other minor changes that do not impact on the operation of the
code.

14 REVOCATION OF A MONITORING BODY

85. When a monitoring body does not comply with applicable provisions of the GDPR, a CompSA will
also have the powers to revoke the accreditation of a monitoring body under Article 41(5).82 It is
important that the code owner sets out in the Code suitable provisions to address a revocation
scenario.

86. However, the consequences of revoking the accreditation of the sole monitoring body for a code
may result in the suspension, or permanent withdrawal, of that code due to the loss of the required
compliance monitoring. This may adversely affect the reputation or business interests of code
members, and may result in a reduction of trust of data subjects or other stakeholders.

87. Where circumstances permit, revocation should only take place after the CompSA has given the
monitoring body the opportunity to urgently address issues or make improvements as appropriate
within an agreed timescale. In cases which involve transnational codes, the CompSA should, before
agreeing to setting parameters with the monitoring body to address the issues raised, liaise with
concerned  SAs  on  the  matter.  The  decision  to  revoke  a  monitoring  body  should  also  be
communicated to all concerned SAs and the Board (for the purposes of Article 40(11)).

15 PUBLIC SECTOR CODES

88. Article 41(6) of the GDPR provides that the monitoring of approved codes of conduct will not apply
to processing carried out by public authorities or bodies.83 In essence, this provision removes the
requirement for an accredited body to monitor a code. This exemption does not in any way dilute
the requirement for the implementation of effective mechanisms to monitor a code. This could be
achieved by adapting existing audit requirements to include monitoring of the code.

82 For transnational codes, it is also essential that the CompSA should ensure that all concerned SAs will be aware
of taking such an action. Similarly, for such codes, a concerned SA should also inform the CompSA in cases where
a data controller (who is supposed to adopt the code) is found to be non-compliant with it, since this finding may
raise concerns on the effectiveness of the monitoring body and the code.
83 The classification of public sector authorities or bodies is a matter for each member state to determine.

APPENDIX 1 - DISTINCTION BETWEEN NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL
CODES

A transnational code refers to a code which relates to processing activities in more than one Member
State. As such, a transnational code may relate to processing activities carried out by a multiplicity of
controllers or processors in several Member States without necessarily amounting to ‘cross-border
processing’ as defined in Article 4(23) of the GDPR.

Therefore, where a code of conduct adopted by a national association in one Member State covers
processing activities by its members in several Member States, it will qualify as a transnational code.

Whereas if an association with a code approved at national level is joined by an international member
that conducts cross-border processing, that member could only claim the benefit of the approved code
for processing activities in the Member State which approved the code.84 Mechanisms would need to
be put in place to ensure that there is adequate transparency as regards the effective territorial scope
of the code.

84 However, using the same example, it would also be open to the code owners to consider extending the scope
of the code and to seek approval for a transnational code.

APPENDIX 2 - CHOOSING A COMPSA

Code owners may have a choice regarding the identification of a CompSA for the purposes of seeking
approval of their transnational draft code.85 The GDPR does not set out specific rules for identifying
the CompSA who is most appropriate to carry out an assessment of a draft code. Nevertheless, to assist
code owners in identifying the most appropriate CompSA, to evaluate their code, some of the factors
which could be taken into account may include the following86:











The location of the largest density of the processing activity or sector;
The location of the largest density of data subjects affected by the processing activity or sector;
The location of the code owner’s headquarters;
The location of the proposed monitoring body’s headquarters; or
The initiatives developed by a supervisory authority in a specific field87;

Whilst these factors are not prescriptive criteria, the decision of choosing a CompSA is important and
should be prudently considered. 88 The CompSA role includes, inter alia, acting as a single point of
contact with the code owners  during the approval process, managing the application procedure in its
cooperation phase, accrediting the monitoring body (if relevant) and acting as the supervisory lead in
ensuring that an approved code is being monitored effectively.

85 See Article 55 in conjunction with Recital 122 of the GDPR.
86 This list is non-exhaustive and non-hierarchical.
87 For example, a Supervisory Authority may have published a detailed and significant policy paper which directly
relates to the processing activity which is the subject matter of the code.
88 A submission for approval of a draft code cannot be refused by a CompSA on the basis that none (or only some)
of the non-exhaustive list of criteria outlined in Appendix 2 are met. It can only be refused on the basis of not
meeting the criteria outlined in the Section entitled ‘Admissibility of a Draft Code’.

APPENDIX 3 - CHECKLIST FOR SUBMISSION

Before submitting a draft code to the competent supervisory authority it is important that you ensure
the following (where relevant) have been submitted/set out and are appropriately signposted within
the documentation:

1. Have  you  provided  an  explanatory  statement  and  all  relevant  supporting  documentation?

(Paragraph 20)

2. Are you an association or other body representing categories of controllers or processors?

7. Have you included mechanisms that allow for the effective monitoring of compliance of the

code? (Paragraph 26)

8. Have you identified a monitoring body and explained how it will fulfil the code monitoring

requirements? (Paragraph 27)

9. Have you included information as to the extent of consultation carried out in developing the
