EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The right of access of data subjects is enshrined in Art. 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It 
has been a part of the European data protection legal framework since its beginning and is now further 
developed by more specified and precise rules in Art. 15 GDPR.  

Aim and overall structure of the right of access 

The overall aim of the right of access is to provide individuals with sufficient, transparent and easily 
accessible information about the processing of their personal data so that they can be aware of and 
verify the lawfulness of the processing and the accuracy of the processed data. This will make it easier 
-  but  is  not  a  condition  -  for  the  individual  to  exercise  other  rights  such  as  the  right  to  erasure  or 
rectification.  

The right of access according to data protection law is to be distinguished from similar rights with other 
objectives,  for  example  the  right  of  access  to  public  documents  which  aims  at  guaranteeing 
transparency in public authorities’ decision-making and good administrative practice.  

However, the data subject does not have to give reasons for the access request and it is not up to the 
controller to analyse whether the request will actually help the data subject to verify the lawfulness of 
the relevant processing or exercise other rights. The controller will have to deal with the request unless 
it is clear that the request is made under other rules than data protection rules.  

The right of access includes three different components: 

  Confirmation as to whether data about the person is processed or not, 
  Access to this personal data and  
  Access to information about the processing, such as purpose, categories of data and recipients, 
duration of the processing, data subjects’ rights and appropriate safeguards in case of third 
country transfers. 
 

General considerations on the assessment of the data subject’s request 

When analysing the content of the request, the controller must assess whether the request concerns 
personal  data  of  the  individual  making  the  request,  whether  the  request  falls  within  the  scope  of 
Art. 15 and whether there are other, more specific, provisions that regulate access in a certain sector. 
It must also assess whether the request refers to all or only parts of the data processed about the data 
subject. 

There  are  no  specific  requirements  on  the  format  of  a  request.  The  controller  should  provide 
appropriate and user-friendly communication channels that can easily be used by the data subject. 
However, the data subject is not required to use these specific channels and may instead send the 
request to an official contact point of the controller. The controller is not obliged to act on requests 
that are sent to completely random, or apparently incorrect, addresses. 

Where the controller is not able to identify data that refers to the data subject, it shall inform the data 
subject  about  this  and  may  refuse  to  give  access  unless  the  data  subject  provides  additional 
information that enables identification. Further more, if the controller has doubts about whether the 
data subject is who they claim to be, the controller may request additional information in order to 
confirm the identity of the data subject. The request for additional information must be proportionate 

Adopted

to  the  type  of  data  processed,  the  damage  that  could  occur  etc.  in  order  to  avoid  excessive  data 
collection.  

Scope of the right of access 

The scope of the right of access is determined by the scope of the concept of personal data as defined 
in  Art.  4(1)  GDPR.  Aside  from  basic  personal  data  like  name,  address,  phone  number  etc.  a  broad 
variety  of  data  may  fall  within  this  definition  like  medical  findings,  history  of  purchases, 
creditworthiness indicators, activity logs, search activities etc. Personal data which have undergone 
pseudonymisation are still personal data as opposed to anonymised data. The right of access refers to 
personal  data  concerning  the  person  making  the  request.  This  should  not  be  interpreted  overly 
restrictively and may include data that could concern other persons too, for example communication 
history involving incoming and outgoing messages.  

In  addition  to  providing  access  to  the  personal  data,  the  controller  has  to  provide  additional 
information about the processing and on data subjects’ rights. Such information can be based on what 
is already compiled in the controller’s record of processing activities (Art. 30 GDPR) and the privacy 
notice (Art. 13 and 14 GDPR). However, this general information may have to be updated to the time 
of the request or tailored to reflect the processing operations that are carried out in relation to the 
specific person making the request.  

How to provide access 

The ways to provide access may vary depending on the amount of data and the  complexity of the 
processing that is carried out. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the request should be understood as 
referring to all personal data concerning the data subject and the controller may ask the data subject 
to specify the request if they process a large quantity of data. 

The controller will have to search for personal data throughout all IT systems and non-IT filing systems 
based on search criteria that mirrors the way in which the information is structured, for example name 
and customer number. The communication of data and other information about the processing must 
be  provided  in  a  concise,  transparent,  intelligible  and  easily  accessible  form,  using  clear  and  plain 
language.  The  more  precise  requirements  in  this  regard  depend  on  the  circumstances  of  the  data 
processing  as  well  as  the  data  subject’s  ability  to  grasp  and  comprehend  the  communication  (for 
example taking into account that the data subject is a child or a person with special needs). If the data 
consists of codes or other “raw data”, these may have to be explained in order to make sense to the 
data subject. 

The main modality for providing access is to provide the data subject with a copy of their data but 
other  modalities  (such  as  oral  information  and  on  site  access)  can  be  foreseen  if  the  data  subject 
requests it. The data can be sent by e-mail, provided that all necessary safeguards are applied taken 
into consideration, for example, the nature of the data, or in other ways, for example a self-service 
tool.  

Sometimes, when there  is a large  quantity of data and it would be  difficult for the data subject  to 
comprehend  the  information  if  given  all  in  one  bulk  –  especially  in  the  online  context  -  the  most 
appropriate  measure  could  be  a  layered  approach.  Providing  information  in  different  layers  may 
facilitate the data subject’s understanding of the data. The controller must be able to demonstrate 
that the layered approach has an added value for the data subject and all layers should be provided at 
the same time if the data subject chooses it.

The copy of the data and the additional information should be provided in a permanent form such as 
written text, which could be in a commonly used electronic form, so that the data subject can easily 
download it. The data can be given in a transcript or a compiled form as long as all the information is 
included and this does not alter or change the content of the information.  

The request must be fulfilled as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the 
request.  This  can  be  extended  by  two  further  months  where  necessary,  taking  into  account  the 
complexity and number of the request. The data subject then has to be informed about the reason for 
the delay. The controller must implement necessary measures to deal with requests as soon as possible 
and adapt these measures to the circumstances of the processing. Where data is stored only for a very 
short period, there must be measures to guarantee that a request for access can be fulfilled without 
the data being erased while the request is being dealt with. Where a large quantityof data is processed, 
the controller will have to put in place routines and mechanisms that are adapted to the complexity of 
the processing. 

The  assessment  of  the  request  should  reflect  the  situation  at  the  moment  when  the  request  was 
received by the controller. Even data that may be incorrect or unlawfully processed will have to be 
provided. Data that has already been deleted, for example in accordance with a retention policy, and 
therefore is no longer available to the controller cannot be provided. 

Limits and restrictions 

The  GDPR  allows  for  certain  limitations  of  the  right  of  access.  There  are  no  further  exemptions  or 
derogations. The right of access is without any general reservation to proportionality with regard to 
the efforts the controller has to take to comply with the data subject´s request.  

According to Art. 15(4) the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of 
others. The EDPB is of the opinion that these rights must be taken into consideration not only when 
granting access by providing a copy, but also, if access to data is provided by other means (on-site 
access  for  example).  Art.  15(4)  is  not,  however,  applicable  to  the  additional  information  on  the 
processing as stated in Art. 15(1) lit. a.-h. The controller must be able to demonstrate that the rights 
or freedoms of others would be adversely affected in the concrete situation. Applying Art. 15(4) should 
not  result  in  refusing  the  data  subject’s  request  altogether;  it  would  only  result  in  leaving  out  or 
rendering illegible those parts that may have negative effects for the rights and freedoms of others.  

Art. 12(5) GDPR allows controllers to reject requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, or to 
charge a reasonable fee for such requests. These concepts have to be interpreted narrowly. Since there 
are very few prerequisites regarding access requests, the scope of considering a request as manifestly 
unfounded  is  rather  limited.  Excessive  requests  depend  on  the  specifics of  the  sector  in which  the 
controller operates. The more often changes occur in the controller’s data base, the more often the 
data subject may be permitted to request access without it being excessive. Instead of refusing access, 
the controller may decide to charge a fee from the data subject. This would only be relevant in the 
case of excessive requests in order to cover the administrative costs that such requests may cause. The 
controller must be able to demonstrate the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of a request.  

Restrictions of the right of access may also exist in Member States’ national law as per Art. 23 GDPR 
and the derogations therein. Controllers who intend to rely on such restrictions must carefully check 
the requirements of the national provisions and take note of any specific conditions that may apply. 
Such conditions may be that the right of access is only temporarily delayed or that the restriction only 
applies to certain categories of data.

The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 70 (1)(e) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of 
the  Council of 27 April 2016 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, (hereinafter 
“GDPR”), 

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended 
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20181, 

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure, 

Whereas the preparatory work of these guidelines involved the collection of inputs from stakeholders, 
both in writing and at a dedicated stakeholders event on data subject rights, in order to identify the 
challenges and interpretation issues faced in the application of the relevant provisions of the GDPR; 

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES

INTRODUCTION - GENERAL OBSERVATIONS  

1. 

2. 

3. 

In today´s society, personal data are processed by public and private entities, during many activities, 
for a wide array of purposes and in many different ways. Individuals may often be in a disadvantaged 
position in terms of understanding how their personal data are processed, including the technology 
used in the particular case, whether it is by a private or a public entity. In order to protect personal 
data  of  natural  persons  in  these  situations,  the  GDPR  has  created  a  coherent  and  robust  legal 
framework,  generally  applicable  with  regard  to  different  types  of  processing,  including  specific 
provisions relating to data subject rights.  

The right of access to personal data is one of the data subjects’ rights provided for in Chapter III of the 
GDPR  among  other  rights,  such  as  for  instance  the  right  to  rectification  and  erasure,  the  right  to 
restriction of processing, the right to portability, the right to object or the right of not being subject to 
automated individual decision making, including profiling2. The right of access by the data subject is 
enshrined both in the Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the EU (the Charter)3 and in Art. 15 GDPR, 
where it is precisely formulated as the right of access to personal data and to other related information.  

Under the GDPR, the right of access consists of three components i.e. confirmation of whether or not 
personal data are processed, access to it, and information about the processing itself. The data subject 
can also obtain a copy of the processed personal data, whereas this possibility is not an additional data 
subject  right  but  the  modality  of  providing  access  to  the  data.  Thus,  the  right  of  access  can  be 
understood both as the possibility of the data subject to ask the controller if personal data about him 
or  her  are  processed  and  as  the  possibility  to  access  and  to  verify  these  data. The  controller  shall

provide to the data subject, on the basis of his/her request, the information falling within the scope of 
Art. 15(1) and (2) GDPR.  

4. 

5. 

The  exercise  of  the  right  of  access  is  realised  both  in  the  framework  of  data  protection  law,  in 
accordance  with  the  objectives  of  data  protection  law,  and  more  specifically,  in  the  framework  of 
“fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of 
personal data”, as put forward by Art. 1(2) GDPR. The right of access is an important element of the 
whole data protection system.  

The practical aim of the right of access is to enable the natural persons to have the control over their 
own personal data4. In order to realise this goal effectively in practice, the GDPR is aiming to facilitate 
this exercise by number of guarantees enabling the data subject to exercise this right easily, without 
unnecessary  constraints,  at  reasonable  intervals  and  without  excessive  delay  or  expense.  All  this 
should lead to more effective enforcement of the right of access by data subject in the digital age, part 
of  which  in  a  broader  sense  is  also  the  data  subject’s  right  to  file  a  complaint  to  the  supervisory 
authority and the right to effective judicial protection5.   

6.  With regards to the development of the right of access, as part of the data protection legal framework, 
it should be  stressed that it  has been an element of the European data  protection system from its 
beginning. In comparison with Directive 95/46/EC, the standard of the data subject rights set out in 
the  GDPR  has  been  both  refined  and  strengthened;  this  also  applies  to  the  right  of  access.  As  the 
modalities of the right of access are now specified more precisely in the GDPR, this right is also more 
instructive from the point of legal certainty for both the data subject and the controller. Besides, the 
specific wording of Art. 15, and the precise deadline for the provision of data under Art. 12(3) GDPR, 
obliges the controller to be prepared for data subject inquiries by developing procedures for handling 
requests.  

7. 

8. 

9. 

The right of access should not be seen in isolation as it is closely linked with other provisions of the 
GDPR, in particular with data protection principles including the fairness and lawfulness of processing, 
the controller´s transparency obligation and with other data subject rights provided for in Chapter III 
of the GDPR.  

In the framework of data subject rights, it is also important both to stress the significance of Art. 12 
GDPR, which lays down requirements for appropriate measures adopted by the controller in providing 
the information referred to in Art. 13 and 14 GDPR, and the communications referred to in Art. 15-22 
and 34 GDPR; these requirements generally specify the form, manner and time limit for the responses 
to the data subject, and in particular for any information addressed to the child.  

The EDPB considers it necessary to provide more precise guidance on how the right of access has to 
be implemented in different situations. These guidelines aim at analysing the various aspects of the 
right  of  access.  More  particularly,  the  section  hereafter  is  meant  to  give  a  general  overview  and 
explanation  of  the  content  of  the  Art.  15  itself  whereas  the  subsequent  sections  provide  deeper 
analysis of  the most  frequent  practical  questions and  issues  concerning the  implementation of the 
right of access.

2  AIM OF THE RIGHT OF ACCESS, STRUCTURE OF ARTICLE 15 GDPR 

AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

2.1  Aim of the right of access  

10. 

11. 

12. 

The  right  of  access  is  thus  designed  to  enable  natural  persons  to  have  control  over  personal  data 
relating to them in that it allows them, “to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing”6. 
More  specifically,  the  purpose  of  the  right  of  access  is to make  it  possible  for the  data  subjects  to 
understand  how  their  personal  data  are  being  processed  as  well  as  the  consequences  of  such 
processing, and to verify the accuracy of the data processed without having to justify their intention. 
In other words, the purpose of the right of access is to provide individuals with sufficient, transparent 
and easily accessible information about data processing, regardless of the technologies used, and to 
enable  them  to  verify  different  aspects  of  a  particular  processing  activity  under  the  GDPR  (e.g. 
lawfulness, accuracy).  

The interpretation of the GDPR provided in these guidelines is based on the CJEU case law which has 
been rendered so far. Taking into account the importance of the right of access, related case law can 
be expected to evolve significantly in future. 

In  accordance  with  CJEU  decisions7,  the  right  of  access  serves  the  purpose  of  guaranteeing  the 
protection of the data subjects’ right to privacy and data protection with regard to the processing of 
data relating to them 8 and may facilitate the exercise of their rights flowing from, for example, Art. 16 
to 19, 21 to 22 and 82 GDPR. However, the exercise of the right of access is an individual’s right and 
not conditional upon the exercise of those other rights and the exercise of the other rights does not 
depend on the exercise of the right of access.  

13.  Given the broad aim of the right of access, the aim of the right of access is not suitable to be analysed 
as a precondition for the exercise of the right of access by the controller as part of its assessment of 
access requests. Thus, controllers should not assess “why” the data subject is requesting access, but 
only “what” the data subject is requesting (see section 3 on the analysis of the request) and whether 
they  hold  personal  data  relating  to  that  individual  (see  section  4).  Therefore,  for  example,  the 
controller should not deny access on the grounds or the suspicion that the requested data could be 
used by the data subject to defend themselves in court in the event of a  dismissal or a commercial 
dispute with the controller.9 Regarding limits and restrictions of the right of access, please see section 
6. 

Example  1:  An  employer  dismissed  an  individual.  One  week  later,  the  individual  decides  to  collect 
evidence  to  file  an  unfair  dismissal  lawsuit  against  this  former  employer.  With  that  in  mind,  the 
individual writes to the former employer requesting access to all personal data relating to him or her, 
as data subject, that the former employer, as controller, processes. 

The controller shall not assess the intention of the data subject, and the data subject does not need to 
provide  the  controller  with  the  reason  for  the  request.  Therefore,  if  the  request  fulfils  all  other 
requirements  (see  section  3),  the  controller  needs  to  comply  with  the  request,  unless  the  request

proves to be manifestly unfounded or excessive in accordance with Art. 12 (5) of the GDPR (see section 
6.3), which the controller is required to demonstrate. 

Variation: The data subject exercises the right of access with regard to the personal data relating to 
him or her during the course of the lawsuit. However, the national law of the Member State, which 
governs  the  employment  relation  between  the  controller  and  the  data  subject,  contains  certain 
provisions  that  limit  the  scope  of  information  to  be  provided  to  or  exchanged  between  parties  to 
ongoing or prospective legal proceedings, which are applicable to the unfair dismissal lawsuit that the 
data  subject  filed.  In  this  context  and  provided  that,  these  national  provisions  comply  with  the 
requirements posed by Art. 23 GDPR10, the data subject is not entitled to receive more information 
from the controller than is prescribed by the national law provisions of the Member State governing 
the information exchange between parties to legal disputes. 

14.  Although the aim of the right of access is broad, the CJEU illustrated also the limits of the remit of data 
protection law and the right of access. For instance, the CJEU found that the objective of the right of 
access guaranteed by EU data protection law is to be distinguished from that of the right of access to 
public documents established by EU and national legislation, the latter aiming at, “the greatest possible 
transparency  of  the  decision-making  process  of  the  public  authorities  and  to  promote  good 
administrative practices”11, an objective not sought by data protection law. The CJEU concluded that 
the right of access to personal data applies irrespective of whether a different kind of right of access 
with a different aim applies, such as in the context of an examination procedure. 

2.2  Structure of Article 15 GDPR 

15. 

In order to reply to a request for access and to ensure that none of its aspects might be disregarded, 
it is necessary first to understand the structure of Art. 15 and the constituent components of the right 
of access stipulated in this Article.  

16.  Art. 15 can be broken down into eight different elements as listed in the table below:

Art. 15(4)  

While all elements of Art. 15(1) and (2) together define the content of the right of access, Art.15(3) 
deals with the modalities of access, in addition to the general requirements set out in Art. 12 GDPR. 
Art. 15(4) supplements the limits and restrictions that Art. 12(5) GDPR provides for all data subjects’ 
rights with a specific focus on rights and freedoms of others in the context of access.  

2.2.1  Defining the content of the right of access  

17.  Art. 15(1) and (2) contain the following three aspects: first, the confirmation whether personal data of 
the requesting person are being processed, if yes, second, access to those data, and, third, information 
on the processing. They can be regarded as three different components which together build the right 
of access.  

2.2.1.1  Confirmation as to ‘whether’ or not personal data are being processed 

18.  When making a request for access to personal data, the first thing that the data subjects need to know 
is  whether  or  not  the  controller  processes  data  concerning  them.  Consequently,  this  information 
constitutes the first component of the right of access under Art. 15(1). Where the controller does not 
process  personal  data  relating  to  the  data  subject  requesting  the  access,  the  information  to  be 
provided would be limited to confirming that no personal data relating to the data subject are being 
processed. Where the controller does process data relating to the requesting person, the controller 
must confirm this fact to this person. This confirmation may be communicated separately, or it may 
be encompassed as part of the information on the personal data being processed (see below).  

2.2.1.2  Access to the personal data being processed 

19.  Access  to  personal  data  is  the  second  component  of  the  right  of  access  under  Art.  15(1)  and  it 
constitutes the core of this right. It relates to the notion of personal data as defined by Art. 4(1) GDPR. 
Aside from basic personal data like name and address, an unlimited variety of data may fall within this 
definition, provided that they fall under the material scope of the GDPR, notably with regards to the 
way in which there are processed (Art. 2 GDPR). Access to personal data hereby means access to the 
actual personal data themselves, not only a general description of the data nor a mere reference to 
the categories of personal data processed by the controller. If no limits or restrictions apply12, data 
subjects are entitled to have access to all data processed relating to them, or to parts of the data, 

                                                           

12 See section 6 of these Guidelines. 

Adopted

depending on the scope of the request (see sec. 2.3.1). The obligation to provide access to the data 
does not depend on the type or source of those data. It applies to its full extent even in cases where 
the requesting person had initially provided the controller with the data, because its aim is to let the 
data subject know about the actual processing of those data by the controller. The scope of personal 
data under Art. 15 is explained in detail in sec. 4.1 and 4.2.  

2.2.1.3 

Information on the processing and on data subject rights 

20. 

The third component of the right of access is the information on the processing and on data subjects’ 
rights that the controller has to provide under Art. 15(1)(a) to (h) and 15(2). Such information could be 
based on text taken, for example, from the privacy notice of the controller13 or from the controller’s 
record of processing activities referred to in Art. 30 GDPR, but may have to be updated and tailored to 
the  data  subject’s  request.  The  content  and  degree  of  specification  of  the  information  is  further 
elaborated in section 4.3.  

2.2.2  Provisions on Modalities 

21.  Art. 15(3) supplements the requirements for the modalities of the reply to access requests laid down 

in Art. 12 GDPR by some specifications in context of access requests. 

2.2.2.1  Providing a copy  

22.  Under the first sentence of Art. 15(3) GDPR, the controller shall provide a free copy of the personal 
data which the processing relates to. The copy therefore refers only to the second component of the 
right of access («access to the personal data processed», see above). The controller must ensure that 
the first copy is free of charge, even where it considers the cost of reproduction to be high (example: 
the cost of providing a copy of the recording of a telephone conversation). 

23. 

The obligation to provide a copy is not to be understood as an additional right of the data subject, but 
as modality of providing access to the data. It strengthens the right of access to the data14 and helps 
to  interpret  this  right  because  it  makes  clear,  that  access  to  the  data  under  Art.  15(1)  comprises 
complete information on all data and cannot be understood as granting only a summary of the data. 
At the same time, the obligation to provide a copy is not designed to widen the scope of the right of 
access:  it  refers  (only)  to  a  copy  of  the  personal  data  undergoing  processing,  not  necessarily  to  a 
reproduction of the original documents (see section 5, para. 152). More generally speaking, there is 
no  additional  information to  be  given  to  the  data  subject  upon  providing  a  copy:  the  scope  of the 
information to be contained in the copy is the scope of the access to the data under 15(1) (second 
component of the right of access as referred to above, see para. 19), which includes all information 
necessary to enable the data subject to understand and verify the lawfulness of the processing.15 

24. 

In light of the above, if access to the data in the sense of Art. 15(1) is given by providing a copy, the 
obligation to provide a copy mentioned under 15(3) is complied with. The obligation to provide a copy 
serves the objectives of the right of access to allow the data subject to be aware of, and verify the 
lawfulness of the processing (Recital 63). To achieve these objectives, the data subject will in most 

                                                           

13 See for information on this Art. 29 Working Party, WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, Guidelines on transparency 
under Regulation 2016/679 - endorsed by the EDPB (hereinafter “WP29 Guidelines on transparency - endorsed 
by the EDPB”). 
14 The obligation to provide a copy was not mentioned in the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. 
15 Questions related to the topic of this paragraph are at issue in a case currently pending before the CJEU (C-
487/21 

Adopted

cases need to see the information not only temporarily. Therefore, the data subject will need to get 
access to the information by receiving a copy of the personal data.  

25. 

In view of the above, the notion of a copy has to be interpreted in a broad sense  and includes the 
different kinds of access to personal data as long as it is complete (i.e. it includes all personal data 
requested) and possible for the data subject to keep. Thus, the requirement to provide a copy means, 
that the information on the personal data concerning the person who makes the request is provided 
to the data subject in a way which allows the data subject to retain all of the information and to come 
back to it.  

26. 

In spite of this broad understanding of a copy, and regarding that it is the main modality by which 
access should be provided, under some circumstances other modalities could be appropriate. Further 
explanations on copies and other modalities of providing access are given in section 5, in particular 
5.2.2 - 5.2.5. 

2.2.2.2  Providing further copies  

27.  Art. 15(3), second sentence concerns situations where the data subject asks the controller for more 
than one copy, for example in case the first copy was lost or damaged or the data subject wants to 
pass on a copy to another person or a Supervisory Authority. On the basis that further copies must be 
provided by the controller upon request of the data subject, Art. 15(3) rules, that for any further copy 
requested, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs (Art. 15(3) second 
sentence).  

28. 

If the data subject asks for an additional copy after the first request was made, questions may arise on 
whether this should be regarded as a new request, or whether the data subject wants an additional 
copy of the data in the sense of Art. 15(3) second sentence, in which case a fee for an additional copy 
may be charged. The response to these questions depends solely on the content of the request: the 
request should be interpreted as asking for an additional copy, insofar as, in terms of time and scope, 
it concerns the same processing of personal data as the former request. If, however, the data subject 
aims to get information on the data processed at a different point in time or relating to a different set 
of data from the one initially requested, the right to obtain a free copy according to Art. 15(3), applies 
once  again.  This  also  is  valid  in  cases  where  the  data  subject  has  made  a  first  request  shortly 
beforehand. A data subject may exercise its right of access through a subsequent request and obtain 
a free copy, unless the request is regarded as excessive under Art. 12(5) with the possibility of charging 
a reasonable fee in accordance with Art. 12(5)(a) (on excessive character of repetitive requests, see 
section 6). 

Example 2: A customer submits an access request to a trading company. One year after the reply of 
the company, the  same customer makes a request  for access under Art. 15 to the same company. 
Irrespective of whether there  have  been new business transactions or other contacts between the 
parties since the previous request, this second request is to be regarded as a new request. Even if no 
change in the data processing by the company occurred– which is not necessarily apparent to the data 
subject – the data subject has the right to get a free copy of the data.  

Variation 1: Even if the customer in the above cases places the new request for example only one week 
after  the  first  request,  this  may  well  be  regarded  as  a  new  request  under  Art.  15(1)  and  (3),  first 
sentence, if it is not to be interpreted as a mere reminder of the first request. Regarding the short 
interval and depending on the specific circumstances of the new request, its excessiveness according 
to Art. 12(5) is at issue (see section 6).  

Adopted  

14 

 

Variation 2: The request for a “new copy” of the information that had already been given in form of a 
copy in response to a previous request, for example in case that the customer lost the copy previously 
received, should, as a matter of course, be regarded as a request for an additional copy as it refers to 
the previous request in scope and time of the processing.  

29. 

If the data subject repeats a first request for access on the grounds that the answer received was not 
complete or that no reasons had been given for the refusal, this request is not to be regarded as a new 
request, since it is merely a reminder of a first unsatisfied request. 

30.  Concerning the allocation of costs in cases of requests for an additional copy, Art. 15(3) establishes 
that the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs that are caused by 
the request. This means, that the administrative costs are a relevant criterion for fixing the level of the 
fee. At the same time, the fee should be appropriate, taking into account the importance of the right 
of access as a fundamental right of the data subject. The controller should not pass on overhead costs 
or other general expenses to the data subject, but should focus on the specific costs that where caused 
by providing the additional copy. When organising this process the controller should deploy its human 
and material resources efficiently in order to keep the costs of the copy low, including if the controller 
involves external support.  

31. 

32. 

In case the controller decides to charge a fee, the controller should indicate in advance that a fee will 
be charged and – as accurately as is possible - the amount of costs it is planning to charge to the data 
subject  in  order  to  give  the  data  subject  the  possibility  to  determine  whether  to  maintain  or  to 
withdraw the request.  

2.2.2.3  Making the information available in a commonly used electronic form 

In the event of a request by electronic form means, information shall be provided by electronic means 
where possible and unless otherwise requested by the data subject (see Art. 12(3) GDPR). Art. 15(3), 
third sentence, complements this requirement in the context of access requests by stating, that the 
controller is in addition obliged to provide  the  answer in a commonly used electronic form, unless 
otherwise requested by the data subject. Art. 15(3) presupposes, that for controllers who are able to 
receive electronic requests it will be possible to provide the reply to the request in a commonly used 
electronic form (for details see sec. 5.2.5). This provision refers to all the information that needs to be 
provided in accordance with Art. 15(1) and (2). Therefore, if the data subject submits the request for 
access by electronic means, all information must  be provided in a commonly used electronic form. 
Questions  of  format  are  further  developed  in  section  5.  The  controller  should,  as  always,  deploy 
appropriate security measures, in particular when dealing with special category of personal data (see 
below, under 2.3.4 ).  

2.2.3  Possible limitation of the right of access  

33. 

Finally, in context of the right of access, a specific limitation is foreseen in Art. 15(4). It states, that 
possible adverse effects on the rights and freedoms of others have to be considered. Questions as to 
the scope and the consequences of this limitation as well as to additional limits and restrictions set 
forth in Art. 12(5) GDPR or under Art. 23 GDPR are explained in section 6.  

2.3  General principles of the right of access 

34.  When data subjects make a request for access to their data, in principle, the information referred to 
in  Art.  15  GDPR  must  always  be  provided  in  full.  Accordingly,  where  the  controller  processes  data 
relating to the data subject, the controller shall provide all the information referred to in Art. 15(1) 

Adopted  

15 

 

and,  where  applicable,  the  information  referred  to  in  Art.  15(2).  The  controller  has  to  take  the 
appropriate  measures  to  ensure  that  the  information  is  complete,  correct  and  up-to-date, 
corresponding as close as possible to the state of data processing at the time of receiving the request16. 
Where two or more controllers process data jointly, the arrangement of the joint controllers regarding 
their  respective  responsibilities  with  regards  to  the  exercise  of  data  subject’s  rights,  especially 
concerning the answer to access requests, does not affect the rights of the data subjects towards the 
controller to whom they address their request17. 

2.3.1  Completeness of the information 

35.  Data subjects have the right to obtain, with the exceptions mentioned below, full disclosure of all data 
relating to them (for details on the scope, see section 4.2). Unless explicitly requested otherwise by 
the  data  subject,  a  request  to  exercise  the  right  of  access  shall  be  understood  in  general  terms, 
encompassing  all  personal  data  concerning  the  data  subject18.  Limiting  access  to  part  of  the 
information may be considered in the following cases: 

a) 

b) 

The data subject has explicitly limited the request to a subset. In order to avoid providing incomplete 
information, the controller may consider this limitation of the data subject’s request only if it can be 
certain that this interpretation corresponds to the wish of the data subject (for further details, see 
section  3.1.1,  para.  51).  In  principle,  the  data  subject  shall  not  have  to  repeat  the  request  for  the 
transmission of all the data the data subject is entitled to obtain.  

In situations where the controller processes a large quantity of data concerning the data subject, the 
controller may have doubts if a request of access, that is expressed in very general terms, really aims 
at  receiving  information  on  all  kind  of  data  being  processed  or  on  all  branches  of  activity  of  the 
controller in detail. These may arise in particular in situations, where there was no possibility to provide 
the data subject with tools to specify their request from the beginning or where the data subject did 
not  make  use  of  them.  The  controller  then  faces  problems  of  how  to  give  a  full  answer  while 
simultaneously avoiding the creation of an overflow of information for the data subject that the data 
subject is not interested in and cannot effectively handle. There may be ways to solve this problem, 
depending on the circumstances and the technical possibilities, for example by providing self-service 
tools in online contexts (see section 5 on the layered approach). If such solutions are not applicable, a 
controller who processes a large quantity of information relating to the data subject may request the 
data  subject  to  specify  the  information  or  processing  to  which  the  request  relates  before  the 
information is delivered (see Recital 63 GDPR). Examples of this may include a company with several 
fields of activity or a public authority with different administrative units, if the controller found that 
numerous  data  relating  to  the  data  subject  are  processed  in  those  branches.  In  addition,  a  large 
quantity of data may be processed by controllers who collect data regarding frequent activities of the 
data subject over a prolonged time period.  

Example  3:  A  public  authority  processes  data  on  the  data  subject  in  a  number  of  different 
departments concerning various contexts. File management and file keeping are partly processed by 
non-automated  means  and  most  of  the  data  is  only  stored  in  paper  files.  Regarding  the  general 
wording of the request, the public authority doubts whether the data subject is aware of the extent 

                                                           

16 For guidance on appropriate measures see sec. 5 para. 123 - 129 
17 EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, par. 162f.. Processors 
have to assist the controller, ibd., para. 129.  
18 For details please see section 5.2.3 below on the topic of layered approach. 

Adopted  

16 

 

 

of the request, especially the variety of processing operations that it would encompass, the amount 
of information and the number of pages that the data subject would receive. 

Example 4: A big insurance company receives a general access request by letter from a person who 
has been a customer for many years. Even though deletion periods are fully respected, the company 
actually  processes  a  vast  amount  of  data  concerning  the  customer,  because  processing  is  still 
necessary to fulfil contractual obligations arising from the contractual relationship with the customer 
(including  for  example  continuing  obligations,  communication  on  controversial  issues  with  the 
customer and with third parties, …) or to comply with legal obligations (archived data that have to be 
stored for tax purposes, etc.). The insurance company may have doubts as to whether the request, 
that was made in very general terms, is really intended to encompass all kinds of those data. This may 
be especially problematic if the insurance company only has a postal address of the data subject and 
therefore has to send any information on paper. However, the same doubts may be relevant  also 
when providing the information by other means. 

 

If, in such cases, the controller decides to ask the data subject to specify the request, in order to fulfil 
its obligation to facilitate the exercise of the right of access (Art. 12(2) GDPR) the controller shall at the 
same time give meaningful information about its processing operations that could concern the data 
subject, by informing about relevant branches of its activities, databases etc.  

Example 5: In an employment relationship, in case of a generally formulated request for access, it is 
not per se clear that the employee wants to receive all user-login data, data on access to a workplace, 
data on settlements in the canteen, data on salary payments, etc. A request for specification made by 
the employer could for example lead to the clarification, that the employee’s interest is to understand 
or verify to whom his performance assessment has been passed on. Without request for specification, 
the employee would receive a large quantity of information, without having an interest in most of the 
data. At the  same time, the  employer would need to give information on the different  contexts of 
processing which could concern the employee in order to allow the employee to specify the request 
sensibly. 

It is important to underline that the request for specification shall not aim at a limitation of the reply 
to the access request  and shall not  be  used to hide any information on the  data or the processing 
concerning the data subject. If the data subject, who has been asked to specify the scope of its request, 
confirms to seek all personal data concerning him or her, the controller of course has to provide it in 
full.  

In any case, the controller should always be able to demonstrate, that the way to handle the request 
aims to give the broadest effect to the right of access and that it is in line with its obligation to facilitate 
the exercise of data subjects rights (Art. 12(2) GDPR). Subject to these principles, the controller may 
await the answer of the data subject before providing additional data according to the data subject’s 
wish, if the controller has provided the data subject with a clear overview of all processing operations 
that could concern the data subject, including especially those that the data subject might not have 
expected, if the controller has also given access to all data that the data subject clearly aimed for, and 
if, furthermore, this information has been combined with clear indication of how to get access to the 
remaining parts of the processed data. 

c) 

Exceptions  or  restrictions  to  the  right  of  access  apply  (see  below  in  section  6).  In  such  cases,  the 
controller should carefully check to which parts of the information the exception relates to and provide 
all information that is not excluded by the exception. For example, confirmation of the processing of 
personal data itself (component 1) may not be affected by the exception. As a result, information has 

Adopted  

17 

 

to be provided about all the personal data and all the information referred to in Art. 15(1) and (2) that 
are not concerned by the exception or the restriction. 

2.3.2  Correctness of the information  

36. 

37. 

The information included in the copy of the personal data given to the data subject has to comprise 
the actual information or personal data held about the data subject. This includes the obligation to 
give information about data that are inaccurate or about data processing which is not or no longer 
lawful.  The  data  subject  may  for  example  use  the  right  of  access  to  find  out  about  the  source  of 
inaccurate data being circulated between different controllers. If the controller corrected inaccurate 
data before informing the data subject about it, the data subject would be deprived of this possibility. 
The same applies in case of unlawful processing. The possibility to know about unlawful processing 
concerning the data subject is one of the main purposes of the right of access. The obligation to inform 
about the unchanged state of processing is without prejudice to the obligation of the controller to end 
unlawful processing or to correct inaccurate data. Questions about the order in which those obligations 
should be fulfilled, are answered in the following.  

2.3.3  Time reference point of the assessment 

The assessment of the data being processed shall reflect as close as possible the situation when the 
controller receives the request and the response should cover all data available at that point in time. 
This means that the controller has to try to find out about all the data processing activities relating to 
the  data  subject  without  undue  delay.  Controllers  are  thus  not  required  to  provide  personal  data, 
which they processed in the past but which they no longer have at their disposal19. For instance, the 
controller may have deleted personal data in accordance with its data retention policy and/or statutory 
provisions and may thus no longer be able to provide the requested personal data. In this context, it 
should be recalled that the length of time for which the data are stored should be fixed in accordance 
with Art. 5(1)(e) GDPR, as any retention of data must be objectively justifiable.  

38.  At  the  same  time,  the  controller  shall  implement  in  advance  the  necessary  measures  in  order  to 
facilitate the exercise of the right of access and to deal with such requests as soon as possible (see 
Art. 12(3))  and  before  the  data  will  have  to  be  deleted.  Therefore,  in  the  case  of  short  retention 
periods, the measures taken to answer the request should be adapted to the appropriate retention 
period in order to facilitate the exercise of the right of access and to avoid the permanent impossibility 
of  providing  access  to  the  data  processed  at  the  moment  of  the  request20.  In  some  cases  it  may 
nevertheless not be possible to reply to a request before the time the data are scheduled for deletion. 
For example, if in course of replying to a request as promptly as possible, a controller retrieves personal 
data that were scheduled to be deleted the following day, the controller may need some additional 
time  to  consider  whether  redactions  need  to  be  made  to  protect  the  freedoms  of  others  before 
releasing  a  copy  of  the  personal  data  to  the  requester.  If  the  data  have  been  retrieved  within  the 

                                                           

19 See, to that effect, further clarifications in section 4 of these guidelines, as well as in Court of Justice of the 
European  Union,  C-553/07,  7  May  2009,  College  van  burgemeester  en  wethouders  van  Rotterdam  v  M.  E.  E. 
Rijkeboer on a right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipients in respect of the past. 
20 For example, the implementation of a self-service tool enabling the data subject to easily access the 
requested personal data and a notification system alerting the controller about a request that relates to 
personal data with short retention periods could be considered in order to facilitate prompt action.

scheduled retention period, the controller may continue to process those data for the purpose to fulfill 
its  obligation  to  answer  the  request.  Processing  in  such  cases  may  be  based  on  Art.  6(1)(c)  in 
combination with Article 15 GDPR and its duration has to comply with the requirements of Art. 12(3) 
GDPR21. The application of this legal basis is limited to processing of the data identified to be necessary 
for answering the concrete request and is not to be used as a justification for general extentions of 
retention periods.

Furthermore,  the  controller  shall  not  deliberately  escape  the  obligation  to  provide  the  requested 
personal data by erasing or modifying personal data in response to a request for access (see 2.3.2). If, 
in the course of processing the access request, the controller discovers inaccurate data or unlawful 
processing,  the  controller  has  to  assess  the  state  of the  processing  and to  inform  the  data  subject 
accordingly before complying with its other obligations. In its own interest, to avoid the need of further 
communication on this as well as to be compliant with the transparency principle, the controller should 
add information about the subsequent rectifications or deletions.  

Example 6: On the occasion of replying to an access request a controller realises, that an application 
of the data subject for a vacancy in the company of the controller has been stored beyond the retention 
period. In this case the controller cannot delete first and then reply to the data subject that no data 
(concerning the application) is processed. It has to give access first and delete the data afterwards. In 
order to prevent a subsequent request for erasure it would then be recommended to add information 
about the fact and time of the deletion.  

In order to comply with the principle of transparency, controllers should infom the data subject as of 
the specific point in time of the processing to which the response of the controller refers. In some 
cases,  for  example  in  contexts  of  frequent  communication  activities,  additional  processing  or 
modifications of the data may occur between this time reference point, at which the processing was 
assessed,  and  the  response  of  the  controller.  If  the  controller  is  aware  of  such  changes,  it  is 
recommended to include  information about  those changes  as well as information about  additional 
processing necessary to reply to the request. 

2.3.4  Compliance with data security requirements 

40. 

Since communicating and making available personal data to the data subject is a processing operation, 
the controller is always obliged to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to 
ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing (see Art. 5(1)(f), 24 and 32 GDPR). 
This  applies  independently  of  the  modality  in  which  access  is  provided.  In  case  of  non-electronic 
transmission  of  the  data  to  the  data  subject,  depending  on  the  risks  that  are  presented  by  the 
processing, the controller may consider using registered mail or, alternatively, to offer, but not oblige, 
the  data  subject  to  collect  the  file  against  signature  directly  from  one  of  the  controller's 
establishments.  If,  in  line with  Art. 12(1)  and  (3),  information  is  provided  by  electronic means,  the 
controller shall choose electronic means that comply with data security requirements. Also in case of 
providing a copy of the data in a commonly used electronic form (see Art. 15(3)), the controller shall 
take  into  account  data  security  requirements  when  choosing  the  means  of  how  to  transmit  the 
electronic file to the data subject. This may include applying encryption, password protection etc. In 
order to facilitate  access to the encrypted data, the controller should also ensure that appropriate 
information is made available so that the data subject can access the decrypted information. In cases 

                                                           

21 This is without prejudice to subsequent processing of data for evidence purposes in connection with the 
handling of the access request for an appropriate period of time. 

Adopted  

19 

 

where data security requirements would necessitate end-to-end encryption of electronic mails but the 
controller would only be able to send a normal e-mail, the controller will have to use other means, 
such as sending a USB-stick by (registered) letter post to the data subject. 

3  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE ASSESSMENT OF 

ACCESS REQUESTS  

3.1 

Introduction 

41.  When  receiving  requests  for  access  to  personal  data,  the  controller  must  assess  each  request 
individually.  The  controller  shall  take  into  consideration,  inter  alia,  the  following  issues,  further 
developed  in  the  following  paragraphs:  whether  the  request  concerns  personal  data  linked  to  the 
requesting person and who the requesting person is. This section aims to clarify what elements of the 
request for access the controller should take into account when carrying out its assessment and to 
discuss possible scenarios for such an assessment as well as its consequences. The controller, when 
assessing a request for access to personal data, shall also take into account, pursuant  to Art. 12(2) 
GDPR, the obligation to facilitate the exercise of the data subject rights, while keeping in mind the 
appropriate security of the personal data22. 

42. 

Therefore, the controllers should be proactively ready to handle the requests for access to personal 
data. This means that the controller should be prepared to receive the request, assess it properly (this 
assessment is the subject of this section of the guidelines) and provide an appropriate reply without 
undue delay to the requesting person. The way the controllers will prepare themselves for the exercise 
of access requests should be adequate and proportionate and depend on the nature, scope, context 
and  purposes  of  processing  as  well  as  the  risks  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons,  in 
accordance with Art. 24 GDPR. Depending on the particular circumstances, the controllers may, for 
example, be required to implement an appropriate procedure, the implementation of which should 
guarantee the security of the data without hindering the exercise of the data subject’s rights.  

3.1.1  Analysis of the content of the request 

43. 

This issue can be more specifically assessed by asking the following questions.  

a)  Does the request concern personal data? 

44.  Under the GDPR, the scope of the request shall only cover personal data23. Therefore, any request for 
information about other issues, including general information about the controller, its business models 
or its processing activities not  related to personal data,  is not to be  considered as a request made 
pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR. Additionally, a request for information about anonymous data or data that 

                                                           

22 The controller  shall ensure appropriate security of the personal data, in accordance  with the integrity and 
confidentiality principle (Art. 5(1)(f) GDPR), by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures, 
as referred to in Art. 32 GDPR and elaborated in Art. 24 GDPR. The controller shall be able to demonstrate that 
it ensures an adequate level of data protection, in line with the accountability principle (see also: Art. 29 Working 
Party Opinion 3/2010 on the principle of accountability adopted on 13 July 2010, 00062/10/EN WP 173 and EDPB 
Guidelines nr 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR). 
23 Unless the request covers also non-personal data inextricably linked to the personal data of the data subject. 
For further explanations see para 100. 

Adopted  

20 

 

does not concern the requesting person or the person on whose behalf the authorised person made 
the request, will not be within the scope of the right of access. This question will be analysed more in 
detail in section 4. 

45.  Unlike anonymous data (which are not personal data), pseudonymised data, which could be attributed 
to a natural person by the use of additional information, are personal data24. Thus, pseudonymised 
data that can be linked to a data subject - e.g. when the data subject provides the respective identifier 
allowing their identification, or when the controller is able to connect the data to the requesting person 
by its own means - are to be considered within the scope of the request25. 

b)  Does  the  request  relate  to  the  requesting  person  (or  the  person  on  whose  behalf  the 

authorised person makes the request)? 

46.  As a general rule, a request may only concern the data of the person making the request. Access to 

other people’s data can only be requested subject to appropriate authorisation26. 

Example 7: Data subject X works as a department manager for a company that provides parking spaces 
for its managers at a company car park. Although data subject X has a permanent parking space, when 
the data subject  arrives  at the  office  for their second shift, this space  is often already  occupied by 
another car. Since this situation is repetitive, in order to identify the driver who unauthorised occupies 
its  slot,  the  data  subject  asks  the  controller  of  the  video  surveillance  system  covering  the  office’s 
parking lot area, for access to the personal data of this driver. In such a case, data subject X’s request 
will not be a request for access to their personal data, as the request does not concern the requesting 
person’sdata, but the data of another person - and therefore it should not be considered a request 
under Art. 15 GDPR. 

c)  Do provisions, other than the GDPR, regulating access to a certain category of data apply? 

47.  Data subjects are not required to specify the legal basis in their request. However, if the data subjects 
clarify that their request is based on sectoral legislation or on national legislation regulating the specific 
issue of access to certain categories of data, and not on the GDPR, such a request shall be examined 
by  the  controller  in  accordance  with  such  sectoral  or  national  rules,  where  applicable.  Often, 
depending on the relevant national legislation, controllers may be required to provide separate replies, 
each dealing with the specific requirements set out by the different legislative acts. This is not to be 
confused with national or EU legislation setting out restrictions on the right of access which needs to 
be complied with when answering access requests. 

48. 

If the controller has doubts as to which right the data subject wishes to exercise, it is recommended to 
ask  the  data  subject  making  the  request  to  explain  the  subject  matter  of  the  request.  Such 
correspondence with the data subject shall not affect the duty of the controller to act without undue 
delay27. However, in case of doubts, if the controller asks the data subject for further explanation and 
receives no response, bearing in mind the obligation to facilitate the exercise of the person’s right of 
access, the controller should interpret the information contained in the first request and act on this 
basis. In accordance with the accountability principle, the controller may  determine an appropriate 

                                                           

24 See Recital 26 GDPR. Further explanations on the concepts of anonymous data and pseudonymised data can 
be found in WP29 Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, p. 18-21. 
25 Art. 29 Working Party, WP242 rev.01, 5 April 2017, Guidelines on the right to data portability - endorsed by 
the EDPB (hereinafter “WP29 Guidelines on the right to data portability - endorsed by the EDPB”), p. 9. 
26 See section 3.4 (“Requests made via third parties/proxies”). 
27 See further guidance on the timing in section 5.3.

21 

 

timeframe  during  which  the  data  subject  may  provide  further  explanation.  When  fixing  such 
timeframe, the controller should leave enough time to comply with the request after it elapsed and 
therefore consider how much time is objectively necessary to compile and provide the requested data 
once the specification was provided (or not) by the data subject.  

49. 

If the request is in the scope of the GDPR, the existence of such specific legislation does not override 
the general application of the right of access, as provided by the GDPR. There might be restrictions set 
out by EU or national law, when allowed by Art. 23 GDPR (see section 6.4).  

d)  Does the request fall within the scope of Article 15? 

50. 

It should be noted that the GDPR does not introduce any formal requirements for persons requesting 
access to data. In order to make the access request, it is sufficient for the requesting persons to specify 
that they want to know what personal data concerning them the controller processes. Therefore, the 
controller cannot refuse to provide the data by referring to the lack of indication of the legal basis of 
the request, especially to the lack of a specific reference to the right of access or to the GDPR. 

For example, in order to make a request, it would be sufficient for the requesting person to indicate 
that: 

 

 

 

they wish to obtain access to the personal data concerning them;  

they are exercising their right of access; or  

they wish to know the information concerning them that the controller processes. 

It should be borne in mind that applicants may not be familiar with the intricacies of the GDPR and 
that it is advisable to be lenient towards persons exercising their right of access, in particular when it 
is exercised by minors. As indicated above, in case of any doubts it is recommended for the controller 
to ask the data subject making the request to specify the subject matter of the request.  

e)  Do the data subjects want to access all or parts of the information processed about them?  

51.  Additionally, the controller needs to assess whether the requests made by the requesting persons refer 
to all or parts of the information processed about them. Any limitation of the scope of a request to a 
specific provision of Art. 15 GDPR, made by the data subjects, must be clear and unambiguous. For 
example, if the data subjects require verbatim “information about the data processed in relation to 
them”, the controller should assume that the data subjects intend to exercise their full right under 
Art. 15(1) – (2) GDPR. Such a request should not be interpreted as meaning that the data subjects wish 
to receive only the categories of personal data that are being processed and to waive their right to 
receive the information listed in Art. 15(1)(a) to (h). This would be different, for example, where the 
data subjects wish, with regard to data which they specify, to have access to the source or origin of the 
personal data or to the specified period of storage. In such a case the controller may limit its reply to 
the specific information requested. 

3.1.2  Form of the request  

52.  As noted previously, the GDPR does not impose any requirements on data subjects regarding the form 
of the request for access to the personal data. Therefore, there are, in principle, no requirements under 
the GDPR that the data subjects must observe when choosing a communication channel through which 
they enter into contact with the controller. 

Adopted  

22 

 

53. 

54. 

55. 

The EDPB encourages controllers to provide the most appropriate and user-friendly communication 
channels, in line with Art. 12(2)  and Art. 25  GDPR, to enable  the data subject to make an effective 
request. Nevertheless, if a data subject makes a request using a communication channel provided by 
the controller28, which is different from the one indicated as the preferable one, such request shall be, 
in general, considered effective and the controller should handle such a request accordingly (see the 
examples  below).  The  controllers  should  undertake  all  reasonable  efforts  to  make  sure  that  the 
exercise of data subject rights is facilitated (for example, when a data subject sends an access request 
to an employee who is on leave, an automatic message informing the data subject about an alternative 
communication channel for this request could be a reasonable effort).  

It should be noted that the controller is not obliged to act on a request sent to a random or incorrect 
e-mail (or postal) address, not directly provided by the controller, or to any communication channel 
that  is  clearly  not  intended  to  receive  requests  regarding  data  subject's  rights  if  the  controller  has 
provided an appropriate communication channel, that can be used by the data subject.  

The  controller  is  also  not  obliged  to  act  on  a  request  sent  to  the  e-mail  address  of  a  controller’s 
employee who may not be involved in the processing of requests concerning data subjects’ rights (e.g. 
drivers, cleaning staff, etc.). Such requests shall not be considered effective, if the controller has clearly 
provided  the  data  subject  with  appropriate  communication  channel.  However,  if  the  data  subject 
sends a request to the controller’s employee who has been assigned to them as their regular contact 
person (such as e.g. a personal account manager at a bank or a regular consultant at a mobile phone 
operator), such contact should not to be considered as a random one and the controller should make 
all reasonable efforts, to handle such a request so that it can be redirected to the contact point and 
answered within the time limits provided for by the GDPR. 

56.  Nevertheless,  the  EDPB  recommends,  as  good  practice,  that  controllers  introduce  appropriate 
mechanisms  to  facilitate  the  exercise  of  data  subjects'  rights,  including  autoresponder  systems  to 
inform  of  staff  absences  and  appropriate  alternate  contact  and,  where  possible,  mechanisms  to 
improve internal communication between employees on requests received by those who may not be 
competent to deal with such requests.  

Example 8: Controller C provides, both on its website and in the privacy notice, two e-mail addresses 
-  the  general  e-mail  address  of  the  controller:  CONTACT@C.COM  and  the  e-mail  address  of  the 
controller’s data protection contact point: QUERIES@C.COM. Additionally, controller C indicates on its 
website that in order to submit any inquiries or to make a request with regard to the processing of 
personal  data,    individuals  should  contact  the  data  protection  contact  point  by  way  of  the  e-mail 
address  provided.  However,  the  data  subject  sends  a  request  to  the  controller’s  general  e-mail 
address: CONTACT@C.COM.  

In such a case, the controller should make all reasonable efforts, to make its services aware of the 
request, which was made through the general e-mail, so that it can be redirected to the data protection 
contact point and answered within the time limits provided for by the GDPR. Moreover, the controller 
is not entitled to extend the period for responding to a request, merely because the data subject has 

                                                           

28 This may include, for example, communication data of the controller provided in its communications addressed 
directly to data subjects or contact data provided by the controller publicly, such as in the controller's privacy 
policy  or  other  mandatory  legal  notices  of  the  controller  (e.g.  owner  or  business  contact  information  on  a 
website). 

Adopted  

23 

 

sent a request to the controller’s general e-mail address, not the controller's data protection contact 
point e-mail address. 

 

Example 9: Controller Y runs a network of fitness clubs. Controller Y indicates on its website and in the 
privacy notice for clients of the fitness club that in order to submit any inquiries or to make a request 
with regard to the processing of personal data, individuals should contact the controller under the e-
mail address: QUERIES@Y.COM. Nevertheless, the data subject sends a request to an e-mail address 
found in the  changing room,  where  he  found a  notice  that reads  "If you  are  not  satisfied with  the 
cleanliness of the room, please contact us at: CLEANERS@Y.COM", which is the e-mail address of the 
cleaning  staff  employed  by  Y.  The  cleaning  staff  are  obviously  not  involved  in  handling  matters 
concerning the exercise of the rights of data subjects - customers of the fitness club. Although the e-
mail address was available on the premises of the fitness club, the data subject could not reasonably 
expect  that  this  was  an  appropriate  contact  address  for  such  requests,  since  the  website  and  the 
privacy notice clearly informed about the communication channel to be used for the exercise of data 
subjects' rights.  

57.  Date  of  receipt  of  the  request  by  the  controller  triggers,  as  a  rule,  the  one  month  period  for  the 
controller to provide information on action taken on a request, in accordance with Art. 12(3) GDPR 
(further guidance on timing is provided in section 5.3). The EDPB considers as good practice for the 
controllers to confirm receipt of requests in writing, for example by sending e-mails (or information by 
post, if applicable) to the requesting persons confirming that their requests have been received and 
that the one month period runs from day X to day Y. 

58. 

59. 

 Identification and authentication  

3.2 
In  order  to  ensure  the  security  of  processing  and  minimise  the  risk  of  unauthorised  disclosure  of 
personal  data,  the  controller  must  be  able  to  find  out  which  data  refer  to  the  data  subject 
(identification) and confirm the identity of that person (authentication). 

It may be recalled that in situations in which the purpose for which the personal data are processed 
do  not  or  no  longer  require  the  identification  of  a  data  subject,  the  controller  does  not  need  to 
maintain identification for the sole purpose of complying with data subjects’ rights, also in light of the 
principle of data minimisation. These situations are dealt with in Art. 11(1) GDPR. 

60.  Art. 12(2) GDPR states that the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject to 
exercise his or her rights, unless the controller processes personal data for a purpose that does not 
require the identification of the data subject and it demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify 
the data subject. In such circumstances, the data subject may, however, decide to provide additional 
information enabling this identification (Art. 11(2) GDPR)29.  

61. 

The controller is not obliged to acquire such additional information in order to identify the data subject 
for the sole purpose of complying with the data subject’s request, also in light of the principle of data 
minimisation. However, it should not refuse to take such additional information provided by the data 
subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights (Recital 57 GDPR).  

Example 10: C is the controller of the data processed in connection with the video surveillance of a 
building. In accordance with Art. 11(1) GDPR, the controller is not obliged to identify all persons who

have  been  registered  by  a  security  camera  as  a  part  of  the  monitoring  (purpose  not  requiring 
identification). The controller receives a request for access to the personal data from the person who 
claims that to have been recorded by the controller’s video surveillance. The controller's actions will 
depend on the additional information provided. If the requesting person indicates a particular day and 
time when the cameras may have recorded the event in question, it is likely that the controller will be 
able to provide such data (Art. 11(2) GDPR). However, if the controller is not in a position to identify 
the data subject (e.g. if it is impossible for the controller to be certain that a requesting person is in 
fact  the data  subject  or if the  request concerns e.g.  a long period of recordings and a controller is 
unable  to  process  such  a  large  quantity  of  data),  the  controller  may  refuse  to  take  action  if  it 
demonstrates that it is not in the position to identify the data subject (Art. 12(2) GDPR). 

 

Example  11:  A  controller  C  processes  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  addressing  behavioral 
advertising to its web users. Personal data collected for behavioral advertising are usually collected by 
means  of  cookies  and  associated  with  pseudonymous  random  identifiers.  A  data  subject  Mr.  X 
exercises his right of access with C via C’s website. C is able to precisely identify Mr. X to show the data 
subject’s behavioral advertising, by linking the terminal equipment of Mr. X to its advertising profile 
with the cookies dropped in the terminal. C should then also be able to precisely identify Mr. X to grant 
him access to his personal data, as a link between the data processed and the data subject can be 
found. Therefore, and taking into account the principles of the GDPR, the above example would not 
fall within the scope of Art. 11 GDPR. More precisely, in the above example, the purposes of C require 
the identification of the data subjects while Art. 11 GDPR addresses the situation of processing which 
does not require identification where a controller shall not be obliged to process additional data within 
the  meaning  of  Art.  11(1)  GDPR  for  the  sole  purpose  of  being  able  to  comply  with  the  GDPR. 
Consequently, in some cases, no additional data should be requested in order to exercise the rights of 
the data subject. 

However, if Mr. X tries to exercise his access right by e-mail or by regular mail, then, in this context, C 
will have no other choice but to ask Mr. X to provide “additional information” (Art. 12(6) GDPR) in 
order to be able to identify the advertising profile associated with Mr. X. In this case, the additional 
information will be the cookie identifier stored in the terminal equipment of Mr. X. 

62. 

In case of demonstrated impossibility to identify the data subject (Art. 11 GDPR), the controller needs 
to inform the data subject accordingly, if possible, since the controller  shall respond to requests from 
the data subject without undue delay and give reasons where it does not intend to comply with such 
requests . This information needs to be provided only “if possible”, as the controller may not be in a 
position to inform the data subjects if their identification is impossible. 

63.  Both where the processing does not require identification and where it requires it, if the controller has 
reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request, the controller 
may  request  the  provision  of  additional  information  necessary  to  confirm  the  identity  of  the  data 
subject (Art.12(6) GDPR). 

64. 

65. 

The  GDPR  does  not  impose  any  requirements  on  how  to  authenticate  the  data  subject.  However, 
Art. 11 and 12 GDPR indicate the conditions for the exercise of all the data subject rights, including the 
right of access to personal data. 

It should be  remembered that, as a rule, the controller cannot  request more  personal data than is 
necessary to enable this authentication, and that the use of such information should be strictly limited 
to fulfilling the data subjects’ request. 

Adopted  

25 

 

66.  Authentication  procedures  often  already  exist  between  the  data  subjects  and  the  controllers.  The 
controllers  may  use  these  authentication  procedures  in  order  to  ascertain  the  identity  of  the  data 
subjects  requesting  their  personal  data  or  exercising  the  rights  granted  by  the  GDPR30.  Otherwise, 
controllers should implement an authentication procedure to do so31.  

67. 

68. 

In cases where the controller requests or is provided by the data subject with additional information 
necessary  to  confirm  the  identity  of  the  data  subject,  the  controller  shall,  each  time,  assess  what 
information will allow it to confirm the data subject’s identity and possibly ask additional questions to 
the requesting person or request the data subject to present some additional identification elements, 
if it is proportionate (see section 3.3).  

In order to allow the data subject to provide the additional information required to identify his or her 
data, the controller should inform the data subject of the nature of the additional information required 
to allow identification. Such additional information should not be more than the information initially 
needed for the  authentication of the data subject. In general, the fact that the controller may request 
additional information to assess the data subject’s identity cannot lead to excessive demands and to 
the collection of personal data which are not relevant or necessary to strengthen the link between the 
individual and the personal data requested32.  

69.  As  a  consequence,  where  information  collected  online  is  linked  to  pseudonyms  or  other  unique 
identifiers, the controller can implement appropriate procedures enabling the requesting person to 
make a data access request and receive the data relating to them33. 

Example 12: The data subject Ms. X requests access to her data while speaking to a helpline consultant 
of an electricity company with which she has concluded a contract. The consultant, having doubts as 
to the identity of the person making the request, generates in the company's system a one-time unique 
code sent to the user’s mobile phone number, provided when the account was set up, as part of the 
double verification system, which action should be considered proportionate in this case. 
 
3.3  Proportionality assessment regarding authentication of the requesting person 

70.  As indicated above, if the controller has reasonable grounds for doubting the identity of the requesting 
person,  it may  request  additional  information  to  confirm  the  data  subject’s  identity.  However,  the 
controller must at the same time ensure that it does not collect more personal data than is necessary 
to  enable  authentication  of  the  requesting  person.  Therefore,  the  controller  shall  carry  out 
a proportionality assessment, which must take into account the type of personal data being processed 
(e.g. special categories of data or not), the nature of the request, the context within which the request 
is  being  made,  as  well  as  any  damage  that  could  result  from  improper  disclosure.  When  assessing 
proportionality,  it  should  be  remembered  to  avoid  excessive  data  collection  while  ensuring  an 
adequate level of processing security. 

71. 

The controller should implement an authentication procedure in order to be certain of the identity of

channel for the data subjects to provide additional information. The method used for authentication 
should  be  relevant,  appropriate,  proportionate  and  respect  the  data  minimisation  principle.  If  the 
controller imposes measures aimed at authentifying the data subject which are burdensome, it needs 
to  adequately  justify  this  and  ensure  compliance  with  all  fundamental  principles,  including  data 
minimisation and the obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subjects’ rights (Art. 12(2) GDPR). 

In an online context, the authentication mechanism may include the same credentials, used by the 
data subject to log-in to the online service offered by the controller (Recital 57 GDPR)35. 

In practice, authentication procedures often exist and controllers do not need to introduce additional 
safeguards to prevent unauthorised access to services. In order to enable individuals to access the data 
contained in their accounts (such as an e-mail account, an account on social networks or online shops), 
controllers are most likely to request the logging through the login and password of the user, which in 
such cases should be sufficient to authenticate a data subject36. Furthermore, the data subjects are 
often already authenticated by the controller before entering into a contract or collecting their consent 
to the processing and, as a result, the personal data used to register the individual concerned by the 
processing  can  also  be  used  as  evidence  to  authenticate  the  data  subject  for  access  purposes37. 
Consequently, it is disproportionate to require a copy of an identity document in the event where the 
data subject making a request is already authenticated by the controller. 

It should be  emphasised that  using a copy of an identity document as a part of the  authentication 
process  creates  a  risk  for  the  security  of  personal  data  and  may  lead  to  unauthorised  or  unlawful 
processing, and, as such, it should be considered inappropriate, unless it is necessary, suitable, and in 
line with national law. In such cases, the controllers should have systems in place that ensure a level 
of security appropriate to mitigate the higher risks for the rights and freedoms of the data subject to 
receive such data. It is also important to note that authentication by means of an identity card does 
not necessarily help in the online context (e.g. with the use of pseudonyms) if the person concerned 
cannot contribute any other evidence, e.g. further characteristics matching to the user account. 

Taking into account the fact, that many organisations (e.g. hotels, banks, car rentals) request copies of 
their  clients’  ID  card,  it  should  generally  not  be  considered  an  appropriate  way  of  authentication. 
Alternatively, the controller may implement a quick and effective security measure to identify a data 
subject  based  on  the  authentication  it  has  previously  carried  out,  e.g.  via  e-mail  or  text  message 
containing confirmation links, security questions or confirmation codes38. 

Information on the ID that is not necessary for confirming the identity of the data subject, such as the 
access and serial-number, nationality, size, eye colour, photo and machine-readable zone, depending 
on a case by case assessment, may be redacted or hidden by the data subject before submitting it to 
the controller, except where national legislation requires a full unredacted copy of the identity card 
(see para. 78 below). Generally, the date of issue or expiry date, the issuing authority and the full name 
matching with the online account are sufficient for the controller to verify the identity, always provided 
that the authenticity of the copy and the relation to the applicant are ensured. Additional information

such as the birth date of the data subject may only be required in case the risk of mistaken identity 
persists, if the controller is able to compare it with the information it already processes.  

77. 

To follow the principle of data minimisation the controller should inform the data subject about the 
information  that  is  not  needed  and  about  the  possibility  to  redact  or  hide  those  parts  of  the  ID 
document.  In  such  a  case,  if  the  data  subject  does  not  know  how  or  is  not  able  to  redact  such 
information, it is good practice for the controller to redact it upon receipt of the document, if this is 
possible  for  the  controller,  taking  into  account  the  means  available  to  the  controller  in  the  given 
circumstances. 

Example 13: The user Ms. Y has created a password protected account in the online store, providing 
her  e-mail  and/or  username.  Subsequently,  the  account  owner  asks  the  controller  for  information 
whether it processes their personal data, and if so, asks for access to them within the scope indicated 
in Art. 15. The controller requests the ID of the person making request to confirm her identity. The 
controller's action in this case is disproportionate and leads to unnecessary data collection.  

However, in order to confirm the identity of the requesting person while preventing unnecessary data 
collection, the controller could require her to authenticate via logging into the account or ask her (non-
intrusive)  security  questions,  the  answer  to  which  only  the  data  subject  should  know,  or  use 
multifactor authentication that were configured when the data subject registered their account, or use 
other existing means of communication known as to belong to the data subject, such as the e-mail 
address or a phone number, in order to send an access password.  

 

Example 14: A bank customer, Mr. Y, plans to get a consumer credit. For this purpose, Mr. Y goes to a 
bank branch to obtain information, including his personal data, necessary for the assessment of his 
creditworthiness. To verify the data subject’s identity, the consultant asks for a notarised certification 
of his identity to be able to provide him with the required information. 

The controller should not require notarised confirmation of identity, unless it is necessary, suitable and 
in  line  with  the  national  law  (for  example,  where  a person  is  temporarily  not  in  possession  of  any 
identity  document  and  proof  of  the  data  subject’s  identity  is  required  by  the  national  law  for  the 
performance  of  a  legal  act).  Such  practice  exposes  the  requesting  persons  to  additional  costs  and 
imposes an excessive burden on the data subjects, hampering the exercise of their right of access. 

78.  Without prejudice to the above general principles, under certain circumstances, authentication on the 
basis of an ID may be a justified and proportionate measure, in particular for entities processing special 
categories of personal data or undertaking data processing which may pose a risk for data subject (e.g. 
medical or health information). However, at the same time, it should be borne in mind that certain 
national provisions provide for restrictions on the processing of data contained in public documents, 
including  documents  confirming  the  identity  of  a  person  (also  on  the  basis  of  Art.  87  GDPR). 
Restrictions on the processing of data from these documents may relate in particular to the scanning 
or photocopying of ID cards or processing of official personal identification numbers39.  

79. 

Taking the above into account, where an ID is requested (and this is both in line with national law and 
justified and proportionate under the GDPR), the controller must implement safeguards to prevent 
unlawful  processing  of  the  ID.  Notwithstanding  any  applicable  national  provisions  regarding  ID 

                                                           

39 Several member states introduced such restriction in their national provisions in this regard stating, for 
example, that making copies of ID cards is lawful only if it results directly from the provisions of a legal act.

authentication, this may include refraining from making a copy or deleting a copy of an ID immediately 
after the successful authentication of the identity of the data subject. This is because further storage 
of a copy of an ID is likely to amount to an infringement of the principles of purpose limitation and 
storage  limitation  (Art.  5(1)(b)  and  (e)  GDPR)  and,  in  addition,  national  legislation  regarding  the 
processing  of  the  national  identification  number  (Art.  87  GDPR).  The  EDPB  recommends,  as  good 
practice, that the controller, after checking the ID card, makes a note e.g. " ID card was checked " to 
avoid unnecessary copying or storage of copies of ID cards. 

3.4  Requests made via third parties / proxies 

80.  Although the  right  of access  is generally exercised by the  data subjects as it pertains to them, it is 
possible for a third party to make a request on behalf of the data subject. This may apply to, among 
others, acting through a proxy or legal guardians on behalf of minors, as well as acting through other 
entities via online portals. In some circumstances, the identity of the person authorised to exercise the 
right of access as well as authorisation to act on behalf of the data subject may require verification, 
where  it  is  suitable  and  proportionate  (see  section  3.3  above)40.  It  should  be  recalled  that  making 
personal data available to someone who is not entitled to access it can amount to a personal data 
breach41.  

81. 

In doing so, national laws governing legal representation (e.g. powers of attorney), which may impose 
specific requirements for demonstrating authorisation to make a request on behalf of the data subject, 
should  be  taken  into  account,  since  the  GDPR  does  not  regulate  this  issue.  In accordance  with  the 
principle of accountability, as well as of the other data protection principles, controllers shall be able 
to demonstrate the existence of the relevant authorisation to make a request on behalf of the data 
subject,  and  to  receive  the  requested  information,  except  if  national  law  differs  (e.g.  national  law 
contains specific rules regarding the trustworthiness of lawyers) leaving the controller to verify the 
identity  of  the  proxy  (e.g.  in  the  case  of  lawyers  checking  enrolment  at  the  bar).  Therefore,  it  is 
recommended  to  collect  appropriate  documentation  in  this  respect,  in  relation  to  the  previously 
indicated general rules regarding confirmation of identity of a natural person making a request and, if 
the  controller  has  reasonable  doubts  concerning  the  identity  of  a  person  acting  on  behalf  of  data 
subject, it shall request additional information to confirm the identity of this person. 

82.  While the exercise of the right of access to personal data of deceased persons amounts to another 
example of access by a third party other than the data subject, Recital 27 specifies that the GDPR does 
not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. The matter is therefore dealt with by national law 
and  Member  States  may  provide  for  rules  regarding  the  processing  of  personal  data  of  deceased 
persons.  However,  it  should  be  borne  in mind  that the  data may,  in  addition, relate  to  living  third 
persons,  e.g.  in  the  context  of  requested  access  to  a  deceased  person’s  correspondence.  The 
confidentiality of such data still needs to be protected. 

3.4.1  Exercise of the right of access on behalf of children 

83.  Children deserve specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of 
the risks, consequences and safeguards concerning their rights in relation to the processing of personal

information, see para. 157.

data42. Any information and communication to a child, where personal data of a child are processed, 
should be in clear and plain language so that the child can easily understand43.  

84.  Children are data  subjects in their own right  and, as such, the right  of access belongs  to the  child. 
Depending on the maturity and capacity of the child, the child may need a third party to act on it’s 
behalf e.g. the holder of parental responsibility. 

85. 

The best interests of the child should be a leading consideration in all decisions taken with respect to 
the exercise of the right of access in the context of children, in particular where the right of access is 
exercised on behalf of the child, for example, by the holder of parental authority.  

86.  Due to the special protection of children's personal data contained in the GDPR, the controller shall 
take appropriate measures to avoid any disclosure of personal data of a minor to an unauthorised 
person (in this respect see also section 3.4 above). 

87. 

Finally, the right of the holder of parental  responsibility to act on behalf of the child should not be 
confused with instances, outside of data protection law, where national legislation may provide the 
right  of  the  holder  of  parental  responsibility  to  ask  and  receive  information  on  the  child  (e.g. 
performance of the child at school). 

3.4.2  Exercising the right of access through portals / channels provided by a third party 

88. 

89. 

There  are  companies  that  provide  services  which  enable  data  subjects  to  make  access  requests 
through a portal. The data subject signs in and gets access to a portal through which they can submit 
for example an access request, request data rectification or data erasure from different controllers. 
Different questions arise from the use of portals provided for by a third party.  

The first issue controllers need to deal with when facing these circumstances is to ensure that the third 
party is acting legitimately on behalf of the data subject, as it is necessary to make sure that no data is 
disclosed to unauthorised parties.  

90.  Additionally,  a  controller  that  receives  a  request  made  through  such  a  portal  needs,  invariably,  to 
handle that request in a timely manner44. There is, however, no obligation for the controller to provide 
the data under Art. 15 GDPR directly to the portal, if the controller, for example, establishes that the 
security  measures  are  insufficient  or  it  would  be  deemed  appropriate  to  use  another  way  for  the 
disclosure  of  data  to  the  data  subject.  Under  such  circumstances,  when  the  controller  has  other 
procedures in place to deal with access requests in an efficient and secure way, the controller can 
provide the requested information through these procedures.

on behalf of the child.

4  SCOPE OF THE RIGHT OF ACCESS AND THE PERSONAL DATA AND 

INFORMATION TO WHICH IT REFERS 

91. 

The present section aims at shedding light on the definition of personal data (4.1) and clarifying the 
scope of the information covered by the right of access in general (4.2 and 4.3). Of note is that the 
scope of the concept of personal data and thus, the differentiation between personal data and other 
data, is an integral part of the assessment carried out by the controller to identify the scope of the 
data that the data subject is entitled to obtain access to45.  

92.  As a preliminary consideration it should be recalled that the right of access can only be exercised with 
regard to processing of personal data falling within the  material and territorial scope of the GDPR. 
Therefore,  personal  data  that  are  not  processed  by  automated  means  or  that  are  not  part  of  or 
intended to become part of a filing system as per Art. 2(1) GDPR or processed by a natural person in 
the course of a purely personal or household activity as per Art. 2 (2) GDPR, are not covered by the 
right of access. 

4.1  Definition of personal data 

93.  Art.  15(1)  and  (3)  GDPR  refer  to  “personal  data”,  and  “personal  data  undergoing  processing”, 
respectively. Therefore, the scope of the right of access is first and foremost determined by the scope 
of the concept of personal data, defined in Art. 4(1) GDPR46. The concept of personal data has already 
been the subject of several Art. 29 Working Party47 documents48 and has been interpreted by the CJEU, 
including in the context of the right of access under Art. 12 of the Directive 95/46/CE.  

94. 

The  WP29  considered  that  the  definition  of  personal  data  in  the  Directive  95/46/EC  “reflects  the 
intention  of  the  European  lawmaker  for  a  wide  notion  of  ‘personal  data’”49.  Under  the  GDPR,  the 
definition still refers to “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person”. Aside 
from basic personal data like name and address, telephone number etc., unlimited broad variety of 
data may fall within this definition, including medical findings, history of purchases, creditworthiness 
indicators, communication contents, etc. In light of the broad scope of the definition of personal data, 

                                                           

45 In accordance with the principle of privacy by design, such analysis is part of the assessment of appropriate 
measures and safeguards to protect data protection principles and data subject rights, which is carried out “at 
the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself”, e.g. reducing 
the response time when data subjects exercise their rights may be one of the metrics. For further explanations, 
see guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default.  
46 As per Art. 4(1) GDPR, “‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person 
(‘data  subject’);  an  identifiable  natural  person  is  one  who  can  be  identified,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  particular  by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or 
more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural 
person;” 
47  The  Art.  29  Working  Party  (Art.  29  WP)  is  the  independent  European  working  party  that  dealt  with  issues 
relating to the protection of privacy and personal data until 25 May 2018 (entry into application of the GDPR), 
the predecessor of the EDPB.

96. 

a restrictive assessment of that definition by the controller would lead to an erroneous classification 
of personal data50 and ultimately to a violation of the right of access.  

In joint cases C-141/12 and C-372/1251 the CJEU ruled that the right of access covered personal data 
contained  in  minutes,  namely  the  “name,  date  of  birth,  nationality,  gender,  ethnicity,  religion  and 
language  of  the  applicant”  “and,  “where  relevant,  the  data  in  the  legal  analysis  contained  in  the 
minute”, but not the legal analysis itself52. The legal analysis was in this context not liable in itself to be 
the subject of a check of its accuracy by the data subject nor of rectification. Furthermore, providing 
access  to  the  legal  analysis  does  not  fulfil  the  purpose  of  guaranteeing  privacy  but  access  to 
administrative documents.  

In  Nowak53,  the  CJEU  made  a  broader  analysis  and  found  that  written  answers  submitted  by  a 
candidate  at  a  professional  examination  and  any  comments  of  an  examiner  with  respect  to  those 
answers  constitute  personal  data  concerning  the  exam  candidate.  More  precisely,  such  subjective 
information are personal data “in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it ‘relates’ to 
the  data  subject”54  as  opposed  to  the  examination  questions,  which  are  not  considered  personal 
data55. Thus, a contextual assessment should shed light on the effect or result an information may have 
on an individual and thus the scope of the right of access.  

Example 15: An individual has a job interview with a company. In this context, the job applicant hands 
over a CV and an application letter. During the interview, the HR officer takes notes on a computer to 
document the interview. Afterwards, the job applicant, as data subject requests access to personal 
data relating to him or her that the company, as controller, collected in the course of the recruitment 
procedure. 

The  controller  is obliged  to  provide  the  data subject  with  personal  data actively  communicated  by 
them in their CV and letter of application. Moreover, the controller needs to provide the data subject 
with the summary of the interview, including the subjective comments on the behaviour of the data 
subject the HR officer wrote during the job interview, subject to any  exemptions under national law 
and in compliance with Art. 23 GDPR. 

97. 

Thus, subject to the specific facts of the case, when assessing a specific request for access, the following 
types of data are, inter alia, to be provided by controllers without prejudice to Art. 15(4) GDPR: 

Special categories of personal data as per Art. 9 GDPR; 
Personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences as per Art. 10 GDPR;  

- 
- 
-  Data  knowingly  and  actively  provided  by  the  data  subject  (e.g.  account  data  submitted  via 

forms, answers to a questionnaire)56; 

-  Observed data or raw data provided by the data subject by virtue of the use of the service or 
the device (e.g. data processed by connected objects, transaction history, activity logs such as

-  Data derived from other data, rather than directly provided by the data subject (e.g. credit 
ratio, classification based on common attributes of data subjects, country of residence derived 
from postcode)58;  

-  Data inferred from other data, rather than directly provided by the data subject (e.g. to assign

Example 16: Elements that have been used to reach a decision about e.g. employee’s promotion, pay 
rise or new job assignment (e.g. annual performance reviews, training requests, disciplinary records, 
ranking,  career  potential)  are  personal  data  relating to  that employee.  Thus  such  elements  can  be 
accessed  by  the  data  subject  on  request  and  respecting  Art.  15(4)  GDPR  in  case  personal  data  for 
example,  also  relate  to  another  individual  (e.g.  the  identity  or  elements  revealing  the  identity  of 
another  employee  whose  testimony  about  the  professional  performance  is  included  in  an  annual 
performance review may be subject to limitations under Art. 15(4) GDPR and hence it is possible that 
they cannot be communicated to the data subject in order to protect the rights and freedoms of said 
employee). Nevertheless, national labour law provisions may apply for instance regarding the access 
to personnel files by employees or other national provisions such as those concerning professional 
secrecy. Under all circumstances, such restrictions to the exercise of the right of access of the data 
subject (or other rights) provided in a national law must respect the conditions of Art. 23 GDPR (see 
section 6.4). 

98. 

Several considerations may be drawn from the above non-exhaustive list of personal data which may 
be provided to the data subject in the context of an access request. It is apparent from the above, that 
the controller may not operate a distinction when providing access to personal data between those 
data contained in paper files and those stored electronically as long as they fall within the scope of the 
GDPR. In other words, personal data which are contained in paper files as part of a filing system, or 
which are intended to form part of a filing system, are covered by the right of access in the same way 
as personal data stored in a computer memory by means of, for example, binary code or videotape. 

99.  Moreover, like most data subject rights, the right of access includes both inferred and derived data, 
including  personal  data  created  by  a  service  provider,  whereas  the  right  to  data  portability  only 
includes data provided by the data subject60. Therefore, in case of an access request and unlike a data 
portability request, the data subject should be provided not only with personal data provided to the

controller in order to make a subsequent analysis or assessment about these data but also with the 
result of any such subsequent analysis or assessment. 

100.  It also is important to recall that there is information, such as anonymous data61, which is data that do 
not relate directly or indirectly to an identifiable person, and that are hence  excluded from the scope 
of the GDPR. For example, the location of the server on which the personal data of the data subject 
processed is not personal data. The distinction can be challenging and controllers may wonder how to 
draw a clear line between personal and non-personal data in particular in the case of mixed datasets. 
In  such  case  it may  be  useful  to  differentiate  between  mixed  datasets  in  which  personal  and  non-
personal data are inextricably linked and those in which this is not the case. Personal and non-personal 
data may be inextricably linked in mixed datasets and fall altogether under the scope of the right of 
access  of  the  data  subject  to  which  the  personal  data  relates62.  In  other  cases  personal  and  non-
personal data in mixed datasets may not be inextricably linked rendering only the personal data in the 
set accessible to the data subject. For example, a company might need to provide a data subject with 
the individual IT incident reports it triggered, but not with the company’s knowledge database of IT 
problems.  However,  which  security measures  the controller  has  put  in  place  is  generally  not  to  be 
understood as being personal data, provided that these are not inextricably linked with personal data, 
and therefore not covered by the right of access. 

101.  Before concluding the section, the EDPB recalls in this context that the protection of natural persons 
with regard to the processing of personal data encompasses all the types of personal data listed above 
and  that  a  restrictive  interpretation  of  the  definition  contravenes  the  provisions  of  the  GDPR  and 
ultimately violates Art. 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The application of a differing regime 
for the exercise of a right in relation to some types of personal data, which has not been foreseen by 
the GDPR can be introduced exclusively by law, in accordance with Art. 23 GDPR (as further explained 
in section 6.4). Thus, controllers cannot limit the exercise of the right of access by unduly restricting 
the scope of personal data. 

4.2  The personal data the right of access refers to 

102.  According  to  Art.  15(1)  GDPR,  “the  data  subject  shall  have  the  right  to  obtain  from  the  controller 
confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where 
that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information”(emphasis added).  

103.  Several elements emerge from paragraph (1) of Art. 15 GDPR. The paragraph refers expressis verbis to 

“personal data concerning him or her”(4.2.1) , which “are being processed”(4.2.2) by the controller: 

4.2.1  “personal data concerning him or her” 

104.  The right of access can be exercised exclusively with regard to personal data relating to the data subject 
requesting access or, where applicable, by an authorised person or proxy (see section 3.4). There are 
also situations  in  which  data  do  not  have  a  link  to  the  person exercising  the  right  of  access  but  to

another individual. The data subject is however, only entitled to personal data relating to themselves 
excluding data which exclusively concern someone else63. 

105.  The classification of data as personal data concerning the data  subject  does,  however, not  depend 
upon the fact that those personal data also relate to someone else64. It is thus possible that personal 
data relate to more than one individual at the same time. This does not automatically mean that access 
to personal data also relating to someone else should be granted, as the controller needs to comply 
with Art. 15(4) GDPR.  

106.  The words “personal data concerning him or her” should not be interpreted in an “overly restrictive” 
way  by  controllers,  as  the  Art.  29  Working  Party  already  stated  with  regard  to  the  right  to  data 
portability65.  Applied  to  the  right  of  access,  the  EDPB  considers  for  example  that  recordings  of 
telephone conversations (and their transcription) between the data subject that requests access and 
the controller, may fall under the right of access provided that the latter are personal data66. Provided 
that  the  GDPR  applies  and  that  the  processing  is  not  covered  by  the  household  exemption  as  per 
Art. 2(2)(c) GDPR, if the  data  subject uses the obtained record which includes personal data of the 
interlocutor for other purposes by, for instance, publishing the record, the data subject will become a 
controller for this processing of personal data relating to the other person whose voice was recorded. 
Although this will not exempt the controller from its data protection obligations when duly analysing 
whether access to the full record may be given, the controller is encouraged to inform the data subject 
about the fact that they may become controller in such case. This is without prejudice to any further 
assessment under Art. 15(4) GDPR detailed in section 6. In the same vein, messages that data subjects 
have sent to others in the form of interpersonal messages and deleted themselves from their device, 
that are still avaible to the service provider, may fall under the right of access.  

107.  Then again, there are situations in which the link between the data and several individuals may seem 
blurred  to  the  controller,  such  as  in  the  case  of  identity  theft.  In  case  of  identity  theft,  a  person 
fraudulently acts in the name of another person. In this context it is important to recall that the victim 
should be provided with information on all personal data the controller stores in connection with their 
identity,  including  those  that  have  been  collected  on  the  basis  of  the  fraudster’s  actions.  In  other 
words, even after the controller learned about the identity theft, personal data which are associated 
with or related to the identity of the victim constitute personal data of the data subject. 

                                                           

63 WP29 Guidelines on the right to data portability - endorsed by the EDPB, p. 9: “Only personal data is in scope 
of a data portability request. Therefore, any data that is anonymous or does not concern the data subject, will 
not be in scope. However, pseudonymous data that can be clearly linked to a data subject (e.g. by them providing 
the respective identifier, cf. Article 11 (2)) is within the scope.”

65  WP29  Guidelines  on  the  right  to  data  portability  -  endorsed  by  the  EDPB,  p.  9:  In  many  circumstances, 
controllers will process information that contains the personal data of several data subjects. Where this is the 
case, controllers should not take an overly restrictive interpretation of the sentence “personal data concerning 
the  data  subject”.  As  an  example,  telephone,  interpersonal  messaging  or  VoIP  records  may  include  (in  the 
subscriber’s account history) details of third parties involved in incoming and outgoing calls. Although records will 
therefore contain  personal data concerning multiple  people, subscribers should  be able  to have these records 
provided to them in response to data portability requests, because the records are (also) concerning the data 
subject. However, where such records are then transmitted to a new controller, this new controller should not 
process  them  for  any  purpose  which  would  adversely  affect  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  third-parties  (see 
below: third condition).” 
66 See example 34 in section 6.2.

Example 17: An individual fraudulently uses the identity of someone else in order to play poker online. 
The perpetrator pays the online casino using the credit card they stole from the victim. When the victim 
finds out about the identity theft, the victim asks the provider of the online casino to provide him or her 
with access to his or her personal data and more specifically, to the online games played and information 
about the credit card used by the perpetrator.  

There is a link between the collected data and the victim as the latter’s identity has been used. After the 
detection of the fraud, the personal data mentioned above still has a link by reason of their content (the 
victim’s credit card is clearly about the victim), purpose and effect (the information about  the online 
games played by the perpetrator may for instance be used to issue invoices to the victim). Therefore, 
the online casino shall grant the victim access to the aforementioned personal data. 

108.  If appropriate, internal connection logs can be used to hold record about accesses to  a file and to trace 
back which actions were performed in connection with accesses to a record, such as printing, copying, 
or deleting personal data. These logs may include the time of logging, the reason for the access to file 
as well as information identifying the person having had access. Questions related to this topic are at 
issue in a case currently pending before the CJEU (C-579/21). The putting in place and the supervision 
and revision of connection logs fall within the controller’s responsibility and are liable to be checked 
by the supervisory authorities. The controller should thus make sure that the persons acting under its 
authority who have access to personal data do not process personal data except on instructions from 
the controller, as per Art. 29 GDPR. If the person nevertheless processes the personal data for other 
purposes than fulfilling the controller’s instructions, it may become controller for that processing and 
subject  to  disciplinary  or  criminal  proceedings  or  administrative  sanctions  issued  by  supervisory 
authorities. The EDPB notes that it is part of the employer’s responsibility under Art. 24 GDPR to make 
use  of  appropriate  measures,  extending  from  education  to  disciplinary  procedures,  to  ensure  that 
processing is in compliance with the GDPR and that no infringement occurs. 

4.2.2  Personal data which “are being processed”  

109.  Paragraph (1) of Art. 15 GDPR moreover refers to personal data, which “are being processed”. The 
time reference point for determining the range of personal data falling within the access request has 
already been elaborated in section 2.3.3. The wording however also suggests that the right of access 
does not distinguish between the purposes of the processing operations.  

Example 18: A company processed personal data relating to a data subject in order to process their 
purchase order and arrange shipping to data subject’s home address. After these initial purposes for 
which the personal data were collected no longer exist, the controller keeps some of the personal data 
solely to comply with its legal obligations relating to the keeping of records.  

The data subject requests access to personal data relating to them. To comply with its obligation under 
article 15 (1) GDPR, the controller needs to provide the data subject with the requested personal data 
which are stored to comply with its legal obligations. 

110.  Archived personal data needs to be distinguished from back-up data that is personal data stored solely 
for the purpose of restoring the data in the case of a data loss event. It should be pointed out, that in 
respect of the principles of data protection by design and data minimisation, the back-up data is in 
principle similar to the data in the live system. Where there are slight differences between personal 
data  in  the  back-up  and  the  live  production  system,  these  are  generally  linked  to  the  collection of 
additional data since  the  last back-up. A decrease  in data in the live  system (e.g.  erasure  after the 
retention period of some data came to an end or following an erasure request) will in some cases only 

Adopted  

36 

 

be overwritten in the back-up data at the time of the subsequent back-up. In case there is an access 
request at the moment where there are more personal data relating to the data subject in the back-
up than in the live system or different personal data (noticeable for example via log of deletions in the 
live production system implemented in full compliance with the principle of data minimisation), the 
controller needs to be transparent about this situation and where technically feasible provide access 
as requested by the data subject, including to personal data stored in the back-up. For instance, with 
the aim of being transparent to data subjects who exercise their right, a log of deletions in the live 
production system may enable the controller to see that there are data in the back-up which are not 
in the live system anymore as they have been recently deleted has and have not yet been overwritten 
in the back-up. 

4.2.3  The scope of a new request to access  

111.  What remains to say is that data subjects are entitled to have access to all data processed relating to 
them,  or  to  parts  of  the  data,  depending  on  the  scope  of  the  request  (see  also  2.3.1  on  the 
completeness  of  the  information  and  3.1.1  for  the  analysis  of  the  content  of  the  request).  As  a 
consequence, where a controller already complied with a request for access in the past and provided 
that the  request is not excessive, the controller cannot narrow the scope of this new  request. This 
means that in relation to any further access request of the same data subject, the controller should 
not  inform  the  data  subject  only  about  the  mere  changes  in  the  personal  data  processed  or  the 
processing itself since the last request, unless the data subject expressly agrees to this. Otherwise, data 
subjects  would  be    obliged  to  compile  their  personal  data  provided  in  order  to  a  complete  set  of 
personal data concerning their information on the processing and on data subjects rights. 

4.3 

Information on the processing and on data subject rights  

112.  In addition to the access to the personal data themselves, the controller has to provide information on 
the processing and on data subject rights according to Art. 15(1)(a) to (h) and 15(2) GDPR. Most of the 
information on those specific points is already compiled, at least in general form, in the controller’s 
record of processing activities referred to in Art. 30 GDPR and/or in its privacy notice elaborated in 
accordance  with  Art.s  12  to  14  GDPR.  Therefore,  it  might  be  helpful  as  a  first  step  to  consult  the 
“Guidelines  on  transparency  under  Regulation  2016/679”  67  of  the  Art.  29  Working  Party,  on  the 
content of the information to be given under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR.  

113.  In order to comply with Art. 15(1)(a) to (h) and 15(2), controllers may carefully use text modules of 
their privacy notice as long as they make sure that they are up-to-date and precise with regards to the 
request of the data subject. Before or at the beginning of the data processing, some information, such 
as the identification of specific recipients or the specific duration of the data processing, can often not 
yet be provided. Some information, like for example the right to complain to a supervisory authority 
(see Art. 15(1)(f)), does not change depending on the person making the access request.Therefore, it 
may  be  communicated  in  general  terms  as  it  is  also  done  in  the  privacy  notice.  Other  types  of 
information, such as the information on recipients, on categories and on the source of the data may 
vary depending on who makes the request and what the scope of the request is. In the context of an 
access  request  under  Art.  15,  any  information  on  the  processing  available  to  the  controller  may 
therefore  have  to  be  updated  and  tailored  for  the  processing  operations  actually  carried  out  with 
regard to the data subject making the request. Thus, referring to the wording of its privacy policy would

not be a sufficient way for the controller to give information required by Art. 15(1)(a) to (h) and (2) 
unless  the  « tailored  and  updated »  information  is  the  same  as  the  information  provided  at  the 
beginning  of  the  processing.  In  explaining  which  information  relates  to  the  requesting  person,  the 
controller could, where appropriate, refer to certain activities (such as “if you have used this service 
…”, “if you have payed by invoice”) as long as it is obvious for the data subjects if they are concerned. 
In the following, the degree of specification required is explained in relation to the individual types of 
information.  

114.  Information on the purposes according to Art. 15(1)(a) needs to be specific as to the precise purpose(s) 
in the actual case of the requesting data subject. It would not be enough to list the general purposes 
of the controller without clarifying which purpose(s) the controller pursues in the current case of the 
requesting  data  subject.  If  the  processing  is  carried  out  for  several  purposes,  the  controller  has  to 
clarify which data or which categories of data are processed for which purpose(s). Unlike Art. 13(1)(c) 
and Art. 14(1)(c) GDPR, the information on the processing referred to in Art. 15(1)(a) does not contain 
information on the legal basis for the processing. However, as some data subjects’ rights depend on 
the applicable legal basis, this information is important for the data subjects to verify the lawfulness 
of  the  data  processing  and  to  determine  which  data  subject’s  rights  are  applicable  in  the  specific 
situation. Therefore, in order to facilitate the exercise of data subjects’ rights in line with Art. 12(2) 
GDPR, the controller is recommended to also inform the data subject as to the applicable legal basis 
for each processing operation or to indicate where they can find this information. In any event, the 
principle of transparent processing requires that the information on the legal bases of the processing 
be made available to the data subject in an accessible way (e.g. in a privacy notice).  

115.  Information on categories of data (Art. 15(1)(b))  may also have to be tailored  to the data subject’s 
situation such that categories which have turned out not to be relevant in case of the requester should 
be eliminated. 

Example 19: In the context of the information referred to in Art. 13/14 GDPR, a hotel states that they 
process a number of categories of customer data (identification data, contact data, bank data, and 
number of credit card etc.). If a request of access is made on the basis of Art. 15, the data subject who 
makes the request must, in addition to the access to the actual data being processed (component 2), 
in  line  with  Art.  15(1)(b)  also  be  informed  as  to  the  specific  categories  of  data  which  are  being 
processed in the specific case (e.g. not including bank data or credit card data in the event payment 
was made in cash).  

116.  Information on “recipients or categories of recipients” (Art. 15(1)(c)) has firstly to take into account 
the  definition  of  recipients  given  in  Art.  4(9)  GDPR.  The  definition  of  recipients  is  based  on  the 
disclosure of personal data to a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body68. From 
Art. 4(9) GDPR follows, that public authorities acting in the framework of a particular enquiry subject 
to specific national provisions are not to be considered as recipients. 

117.  Concerning the question, if the controller is free to choose between information on recipients or on 
categories of recipients, it has to be noted that “unlike Art. 13 and 14 of the GDPR, which lay down an 
obligation on the part of the controller (…), Article 15 of the GDPR lays down a genuine right of access 
for the data subject, with the result that the data subject must have the option of obtaining either 

                                                           

68 It should further be noted, that different controllers as defined by Art. 4(7) GDPR may exist within the same 
company. In this constellation a disclosure of data from one recipient to another within one company is possible.  

Adopted  

38 

 

information  about  the  specific  recipients  to  whom  the  data  have  been  or  will  be  disclosed,  where 
possible, or information about the categories of recipients.”69 It has also to be recalled, that, as stated 
in the above-mentioned guidelines on transparency70, already under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR information 
on  the  recipients  or  categories  of  recipients  should  be  as  concrete  as  possible  in  respect  of  the 
principles of transparency and fairness. Under Article 15, if the data subject has not chosen otherwise, 
the  controller  is  obliged  to  name  the  actual  recipients,  unless  it  is  impossible  to  identify  those 
recipients or the controller demonstrates that the data subject’s requests for access are manifestly 
unfounded or excessive within the meaning of Article 12(5) GDPR71 72. The EDPB recalls in this regard, 
that storing information relating to the actual recipients is necessary inter alia to be able to comply 
with the controller’s obligations under Art. 5(2) and 19 GDPR.  

Example 20: In its privacy notice an employer gives information about which categories of data are 
passed on to “travel agencies” or “hotels” in case of business trips, in accordance with Art. 13(1)(e) 
and 14(1)(e) GDPR. If an employee makes a request for access to the personal data after business trips 
have taken place, the employer should then, concerning the recipients of the personal data pursuant 
to Art. 15(1)(c), indicate in its reply the travel agency(ies) and hotel(s) that received the data. While 
the employer legitimately referred to categories of recipients in its privacy notice pursuant to Art. 13 
and  14,  because  at  this stage,  it was  not  yet  possible  to  name  the  recipients,  it  should,  unless  the 
employee  has  chosen  otherwise,  provide  information  as  to  the  specific  recipients  (name  of  travel 
agencies, hotels etc.) when the employee is making an access request.  

Where, respecting the conditions mentioned above, a controller may only provide the categories of 
recipients, the information should be as specific as possible by indicating the type of recipient (i.e. by 
reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the location of the 
recipients73. 

118.  According to Art. 15(1)(d), information has to be given on the envisaged period for which the personal 
data will be stored, where possible. Otherwise, the criteria used to determine that period have to be 
provided. The information given by the controller has to be precise enough for the data subject to 
know how long the data relating to the data subject will continue to be stored. If it is not possible to 
specify the time of deletion, the duration of storage periods and the beginning of this period or the 
triggering event (e.g. termination of a contract, expiration of a warranty period, etc.) shall be specified. 
The  mere  reference,  for  example  to  "deletion  after  expiry  of  the  statutory  storage  periods"  is  not 
sufficient. Indications concerning data storage periods will have to focus on the specific data relating 
to the data subject. If the personal data of the data subject is subject to different deletion periods (e.g. 
because  not  all  data  is  subject  to  legal  storage  obligations),  the  deletion  periods  shall  be  stated  in 
relation to the respective processing operations and categories of data. 

119.  Whereas information on the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 15(1)(f)) is 
not dependant on the specific circumstances, the data subjects rights mentioned in Art. 15(1)(e) vary 
depending on the legal basis underlying the processing. With regard to its obligation to facilitate the 
exercise of data subject rights pursuant to Art. 12(2) GDPR, the response by the controller on those

rights  shall  be  individually  tailored  to  the  case  of  the  data  subject  and  relate  to  the  processing 
operations concerned. Information on rights that are not applicable for the data subject in the specific 
situation should be avoided. 

120.  According to Art. 15(1)(g), “any available information” as to the source of the data has to be provided, 
where the personal data are not collected from the data subject. The degree of available information 
may change over time.  

Example 21: The privacy policy of a large company states:  

“Credit checks help us to prevent problems in payment transactions. They guarantee the protection of 
our company against financial risks, which can also affect sales prices in the medium to long term. A 
credit check is necessarily carried out when we are going to ship goods without receiving the respective 
purchase price at the same time, e.g. in the case of a purchase on account. Without carrying out the 
credit check, only a prepayment payment option (immediate bank transfer, online payment provider, 
credit card) is possible.  

For the purpose of credit checking, we will send your name, address and date of birth to the following 
service providers, for example: (1) Financial Information Agency X (2) Business Information Provider Y, 
(3) Commercial Credit Reference Agency Z. 

The data are passed on to the above-mentioned credit institutions only within the scope of what is 
legally permissible and only for the purposes of the analysis of your past payment behaviour as well as 
for  the  assessment  of  the  risk  of  default  on  the  basis  of  mathematical-statistical  procedures  using 
address data as well as for verification of your address (examination of delivery). Depending on the 
result of the credit check, we may no longer be able to offer you individual payment methods, such as 
the purchase of invoices.” 

The privacy notice thus contains general information on the possibility of obtaining information from 
the listed Economic Information Offices in accordance with Art. 13 and 14 GDPR. If it is not clear ex 
ante, which of the companies will get involved in the processing, it is sufficient to mention the names 
of the eligible companies in the privacy policy. In the context of a request based on Art. 15, in addition 
to the information that a creditworthiness information has been obtained, it would then (ex post) be 
necessary  to  disclose,  which  of  the  companies  mentioned  has  been  involved  exactly.  It  is  clearly 
expressed  by  Art.  15(1)(g),  that  information on  the  processing  of the  data  comprise  “any  available 
information as to their source” where the personal data are not collected from the data subject.  

121.  Art. 15(1)(h) provides that every data subject should have the right to be informed, in a meaningful 
way,  inter  alia,  about  the  existence  and  underlying  logic  of  automated  decision-making  including 
profiling concerning the data subject and about the significance and the envisaged consequences that 
such processing could have74. If possible, information under Art. 15(1)(h) has to be more specific in 
relation to the reasoning that  lead to specific decisions concerning the data subject  who asked for 
access.  

122.  Information  about  intended  transfers  of  data  to  a  third  country  or  an  international  organisation,

under Art. 13(1)(f) and 14(1)(f) GDPR. In the context of a request for access under Art. 15, Art. 15(2)

transfer to a third country or an international organisation is actually taking place. 

5  HOW CAN A CONTROLLER PROVIDE ACCESS?  
 

123.  The GDPR is not very prescriptive as to how the controller has to provide access. The right of access 
may be easy and straight forward to apply in some situations, for example when a small organisation 
holds  limited  information  about  the  data  subject.  In  other  situations,  the  right  of  access  is  more 
complicated because the data processing is more complex; with regard to the number of data subjects, 
the  categories  of  processed  data  as  well  as  the flow  of  data  within  and  between  different 
organisations. Considering the differences in personal data processing, the appropriate way to provide 
access may vary accordingly.  

124.  This section aims at giving some guidance and practical examples on different ways for controllers to 
comply with an access request as well as to the meaning of Art. 12(1) GDPR in relation to the right of 
access. This section will also give some guidance about what is considered to be a commonly used 
electronic form as well as the timing for the provision of access under Art. 12(3) GDPR. 

5.1  How can the controller retrieve the requested data?  

125.  The data subjects should have access  to all the information that the controller processes regarding 
them. This means, for example, that the controller is obliged to search for personal data throughout 
its  IT  systems  and  non-IT  filing  systems.  When  carrying  out  such  search,  the  controller  should  use 
available information in the organisation regarding the data subject that likely will result in matches in 
the  systems  depending  on  how  the  information  is  structured75.  For  example,  if  the  information  is 
sorted in files depending on name or a reference number, the search could be limited to these factors. 
But if the structure of the data depends on other factors, such as family relations or professional titles 
or any kind of direct or indirect  identifiers (e.g.  customer number, user name or IP-addresses), the 
search needs to be extended to include these, provided that the controller also holds this information 
related to the data subject, or is provided with that information by the data subject. The same applies 
when records regarding third persons are likely to contain personal data regarding the data subject. 
The controller may, however, not require the data subject to provide more information than necessary 
to identify the data subject. If a controller uses a processor for its data processing activities the search 
naturally has to be extended to also include personal data processed by the processor. 

126.  In  line  with  Art.  25  GDPR  on  data  protection  by  design  and  by  default,  the  controller  (and  any 
processors it uses) should also already have implemented functions enabling the compliance with data 
subject rights. This means, in this context, that there should be appropriate ways to find and retrieve 
information regarding a data subject when handling a request. However, it should be noted that an 
excessive interpretation in this regard could lead to functions for finding and retrieving information 
that in itself pose a risk for the privacy of data subjects. It is therefore important to keep in mind that 
the process to retrieve data should also be designed in a data protection friendly way, so that it doesn’t 
compromise the privacy of others, for example the employees of the controller.  

                                                           

75 Such a search should naturally also include information that is held by a processor, see. Article 28(3)(e) 
GDPR.

5.2  Appropriate measures for providing access 

5.2.1  Taking “appropriate measures” 

127.  Art. 12 GDPR lays down the requirements for providing access, i.e. for providing the confirmation, the 
personal data and the supplementary information under Art. 15, and also specifies the form, manner 
and time limit in relation to the right of access. Art. 29 Working Party’s “Guidelines on transparency 
under Regulation 2016/679”76 provides further guidance as regards Art. 12, mostly in relation to Art. 13 
and 14 GDPR but also in relation to Art. 15 and on transparency in general. Thus, what is defined in 
those guidelines can often equally apply with regards to providing access under Article 15. 

128.  Art.  12(1)  of  the  GDPR  states  that  the  controller  shall  take  appropriate  measures  to  provide  any 
communication  under  Art.  15  relating  to  processing  to  the  data  subject  in  a  concise,  transparent, 
intelligible  and  easily  accessible  form,  using  clear  and  plain  language.  Art.  12(2)  provides  that  the 
controller shall facilitate the data subject’s exercise of access right. The more precise requirements in 
this regard will have to be assessed case by case. When deciding which measures are appropriate, the 
controllers have to take into account all the relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the 
amount of data being processed, the complexity of their data processing and the knowledge they have 
about their data subjects, for example if the majority of the data subjects are children, elderly people 
or  people  with  disabilities.  In  addition,  in  situations  where  the  controller  is  made  aware  of  any 
particular needs of the data subject making the request, for example through additional information 
in the request made, the controller needs to take these circumstances into consideration. As a result 
the appropriate measures will vary. 

129.  It is important to keep in mind when making the assessment that the term ”appropriate” should never 
be  understood as a way of limiting the  scope of the data covered by the right of access. The term 
“appropriate” does not mean that the efforts to provide the information can be balanced against, for 
example,  any  interest  the  data  subject  may  have  in  obtaining  the  personal  data.  Instead  the 
assessment should aim at choosing the most appropriate method for providing all information covered 
by this right, depending on the specific circumstances in each case. As a consequence, a controller who 
processes a large quantity of data on a large scale must accept to undertake great efforts to ensure 
the right of access to the data subjects in a consice, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, 
by using plain and clear language.  

130.  It  needs  to  be  avoided  to direct  the  data  subject  to different  sources  in  response  to  a  data  access 
request. As previously stated in the WP29 Guidelines on Transparency (with regard to the notion of 
“provide” in Art. 13 and 14 GDPR), the notion of “provide” entails that “the data subject must not have 
to actively search for information covered by these articles amongst other information, such as terms 
and conditions of use of a website or app”77. Therefore, and in respect of the transparency principle, 
data subjects must obtain from the controller the information and personal data required by Art. 15(1), 
15(2)  and  15(3)  in  a  way  that  enables  complete  access  to  the  requested  information.  In  special 
circumstances,  it  would  be  inappropriate  or  even  unlawful  to  share  the  information  within  the 
controller, for example due to the sensitive nature of the information (such as information relating to 
whistleblowing). In these cases, it would be deemed appropriate to split the information into several 
replies as a response to the data subjects access request. The method chosen by the controller must

actually  provide  the  data  subject  with  the  requested  data  and  information,  hence  it  would  not  be 
appropriate to solely refer the data subject to check the requested data stored on their own device 
including, for example, to check clickstream history and IP addresses on their mobile phone. 

131.  In accordance with the accountability principle, a controller must document their approach to be able 
to  demonstrate  how  the  means  chosen  to  provide  the  necessary  information  under  Art.  15  are 
appropriate in the circumstances at hand.  

5.2.2  Different means to provide access 

132.  As  already  explained  in  section  2.2.2  above,  when making  an  access  request  the  data  subjects  are 
entitled to receive a copy of their data undergoing processing pursuant to Art. 15(3) together with the 
supplementary  information,  which  is  considered  as  the  main  modality  for  providing  access  to  the 
personal data.  

133.  However, in some circumstances it could be appropriate for the controller to provide access through 
other ways than providing a copy. Such non-permanent modalities of access to the data could be, for 
example: oral information, inspection of files, onsite or remote access without possibility to download. 
These modalities may be appropriate ways of granting access for example in cases where it is in the 
interest of the data subject or the data subject asks for it. Onsite access could also be appropriate, as 
an initial measure, when a controller handles a large quantity of non-digitalized data to allow the data 
subject to be made aware of what personal data are undergoing processing and to be able to make an 
informed decision about what personal data he or she wants to be provided through a copy.  Non-
permanent ways of access can be  sufficient and adequate in certain situations; for example, it  can 
satisfy the need of the data subjects to verify that the data processed by the controller are correct by 
giving  data  subjects  a  chance  to  view  the  original  data.  A  controller  is  not  obliged  to  provide  the 
information through other ways than providing a copy but should take a reasonable approach when 
considering such a request. Giving access through other ways than providing a copy does not preclude 
the data subjects from the right to also have a copy, unless they choose not to.  

134.  The  controller  may  choose,  depending  on  the  situation  at  hand,  to  provide  the  copy  of  the  data 
undergoing processing, together with the supplementary information, in different ways, e.g. by e-mail, 
physical mail or by the use of a self-service tool. If the data subject makes the request by electronic 
means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a 
commonly  used  electronic  form  as  stated  in  Art.  15(3).  In  any  case,  the  controller  has  to  consider 
appropriate  technical  and  organizational  measures,  including  adequate  encryption  when  providing 
information via e-mail or online-self-service tools.  

135.  In  the  situation,  where  the  controller  is  processing personal  data  regarding  the  person making  the 
request only in a small scale, the copy of the personal data and the supplementary information can 
and should be provided through a simple procedure.  

Example 22: A local bookstore keeps a record of name and addresses of their customers that have 
ordered  home  delivery.  A  customer  visits  the  bookstore  and  makes  a  request  for  access.  In  this 
situation it would be sufficient to print out the personal data concerning the customer directly from 
the business system, while also supplying the supplementary information in Art. 15(1) and (2).  
 
Example 23: A monthly donor to a charity organisation makes an access request through e-mail. The 
charity organisation holds information about donations made in the past twelve months, as well as 
names and e-mail addresses of the donors. The controller could provide the copy of the personal data 

Adopted  

43 

 

and  the  supplementary  information  by  responding  to  the  e-mail,  provided  that  all  necessary 
safeguards are applied, taking into consideration for example the nature of the data.  

136.  Even  controllers  that  process  a  large  quantity  of  data  can  choose  to  rely  on  manual  routines  for 
handling  access  requests.  If  the  controller  processes  data  in  several  different  departments,  the 
controller needs to collect the personal data from each department to be able to respond to the data 
subject request. 

Example 24: An administrator is appointed by the controller to handle the practical issues regarding 
access  requests.  When  receiving  a  request  the  administrator  sends  an  enquiry  by  e-mail  to  the 
different  departments  of  the  organisation  asking  them  to  collect  personal  data  regarding  the  data 
subject. Representatives of each department give the administrator the personal data processed by 
their department. The administrator then sends all the personal data to the data subject together with 
the necessary supplementary information, for example and when appropriate, by e-mail.  

137.  Although  manual  processes  for  handling  access  requests  could  be  regarded  as  appropriate,  some 
controllers may benefit from using automated processes to handle data subject requests. This could, 
for example, be the case for controllers that receive a large number of requests. One way to provide 
the  information  under  Art.  15  is  by  providing  the  data  subject  with  self-service  tools.  This  could 
facilitate an efficient and timely handling of data subjects’ requests of access and will also enable the 
controller to include the verification mechanism in the self-service tool.  

Example 25: A social media service has an automated process for handling access requests in place 
that enables the data subject to access their personal data from their user account. To retrieve the 
personal data the social media users can choose the option to “Download your personal data” when 
logged into their user account. This self-service option allows the users to download a file containing 
their personal data directly from the user account to their own computer.  

138.  The use of self-service tools should never limit the scope of personal data received. If not possible to 
give all the information under Art. 15 through the self-service tool, the remaining information needs 
to be provided in a different manner. The controller may indeed encourage the data subject to use a 
self-service tool that the controller has set in place for handling access requests. However, it should be 
noted that the controller must also handle access requests that are not sent through the established 
channel of communication78. 

5.2.3  Providing access in a ”concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form using 

clear and plain language”  

139.  According to Art. 12(1) GDPR the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide access under 
Art. 15 in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. 

140.  The requirement that providing access to the data subject has to be done in a concise and transparent 
form means, that controllers should present the information efficiently and succinctly in order to be 
easily understood by the data subject, especially if it is a child. The controller needs to take into account 
the quantity and complexity of the data when choosing the means for providing access under Art. 15.  

Example 26: A social media provider processes a large quantity of information about a data subject. A 
large part of this personal data is information contained in hundreds of pages of log files where the 

                                                           

78 See section 3.1.2. 

Adopted  

44 

 

data subject’s activities on the website are registered. If data subjects request access to their personal 
data, the personal data in these log files are indeed covered by the right of access. The right of access 
may therefore be formally fulfilled if these hundreds of pages of log files were to be provided to the 
data subject. However, without measures taken to facilitate the understanding of the information in 
the log files, the data subject’s right of access might not be met in practice, because no knowledge can 
easily  be  drawn  from  the  log  files,  therefore  not  fulfilling  the  requirement of  Art.  12(1)  GDPR.  The 
controller  must  therefore  be  careful  and  thorough  when  choosing  the  way  the  information  and 
personal data is presented to the data subject. 

141.  Under the circumstances in the example above, the use of a layered approach, similar to the layered 
approach advocated in the Guidelines on transparency with regard to privacy notices79, could be an 
appropriate measure to fulfil both the requirements in Art. 15 and 12(1) GDPR. This will be further 
developed under section 5.2.4. below. The requirement that the information is “intelligible” means 
that it should be understood by the intended audience80, whilst keeping in mind any particular needs 
that  the  data  subject  might  have  that  is  known  to  the  controller81.  Since  the  right  of  access  often 
enables the exercise of other data subject rights, it is crucial that the information provided is made 
understandable and clear. This is because data subjects will only be able to consider whether to invoke 
their right to, for example, rectification under Art. 16 GDPR once they know what personal data are 
being  processed,  for  what  purposes  etc.  As  a  result,  the  controller  might  need  to  supply  the  data 
subject with additional information that explains the data provided. It should be emphasised that the 
complexity  of  data  processing  obliges  the  controller  to  provide  the  means  to  make  the  data 
understandable and could not be used as an argument to limit the access to all data. Similarly, the 
controller’s obligation to provide data in a concise manner cannot be used as an argument to limit 
access to all data. 

Example 27: An ecommerce website collects data about items viewed or purchased on its website for 
marketing  purposes.  A  part  of  this  data  will  consist of  data  in  a  raw  format82,  which  has  not  been 
analysed  and may  not  be directly meaningful  to  the  reader  (codes,  activity  history etc.).  Such  data 
related  to  the  data  subjects  activities  is  also  covered  by  the  right  of  access  and  should,  as  a 
consequence, be provided to the data subject in response to an  access request. When providing data 
in a raw format it is important that the controller takes the necessary measures to ensure that the data 
subject understands the data, for example, by providing an explanatory document that translates the 
raw format into a user friendly form. Also,  such a document could  explain that abbreviations and 
other acronyms for example “A” means that the purchase has been interrupted and “B” means that 
the purchase has gone through. 

 

 

142.  The “easily accessible” element means that the information under Art. 15 should be presented in a 
way that is easy for the data subject to access. This applies for example, to the layout, appropriate 

                                                           

79 WP29 Guidelines on transparency - endorsed by the EDPB, para. 35.  
80  Intelligibility  is  closely  linked  to  the  requirement  to  use  a  plain  and  clear  language  (WP29  Guidelines  on 
transparency - endorsed by the EDPB, para. 9). What is said about a plain and clear language in para. 12-16 with 
regards to information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, equally applies to communication under Article 
15.  
81 See para. 128. 
82 The raw format in the example is to be understood as unanalysed data underlying a processing, and not the 
lowest level of raw data that may only be machine-readable (such as “bits”).

headings and paragraphing. The information should always be provided in plain and clear language. A 
controller that offers a service in a country should also offer answers in the language that is understood 
by the data subjects in that country. The use of standardised icons is also encouraged when it facilitates 
the  intelligibility  and  accessibility  of  the  information.  When  the  request  for  information  relates  to 
visually  impaired  data  subjects  or  other  data  subjects  who  may  have  difficulty  in  accessing  or 
understanding information, the controller is expected to take measures facilitating the understanding 
of the information provided, including oral information, when adequate83. The controller should take 
special care to ensure that elderly people, children, visually impaired persons or persons with cognitive 
or other disabilities can exercise their rights, for instance, by proactively providing easily accessible 
elements to facilitate exercise of these rights. 

5.2.4  A large quantity of information necessitates specific requirements on how the 

information is provided  

143.  Regardless  of  the  means  used  to  provide  access  there  may  be  a  tension  between  the  amount  of 
information the controller needs to provide data subjects with and the requirement that it must be 
concise. One way of achieving both, and an example of an appropriate measure for certain controllers, 
when  a  large  quantity  of  data  is  to  be  provided,  is  to  use  a  layered  approach.  This  approach  can 
facilitate the  data  subjects’  understanding  of  the  data.  It  should  nevertheless  be  stressed  that  this 
approach can only be used under certain circumstances and needs to be carried out in a way that does 
not limit the right of access, as explained below. Furthermore, the use of a layered approach should 
not create an extra burden for the data subject. Hence, it would be best suited when access is provided 
in an online context. A layered approach is merely a way to present the information under Art. 15 in a 
manner which is also compliant with the requirements in Art. 12(1) GDPR and should not be confused 
with the possibility for the controllers to request that the data subject specifies the information or 
processing activities to which the request relates, as prescribed in Recital 63 of the GDPR84. 

144.  A  layered  approach  in  relation  to  the  right  of  access  means  that  a  controller,  under  certain 
circumstances,  can  provide  the  personal  data  and  the  supplementary  information  required  under 
Art. 15 in different layers. The first layer should include information about the processing and data 
subject’s rights according to Art. 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) as well as a first part of the processed personal 
data. In a second layer, more personal data should be provided.  

145.  When deciding what information should be given in the different layers the controller should consider 
what information the data subject in general would consider as most relevant. In line with the fairness 
principle, the first layer should also contain information on the processing which has the most impact 
on  the  data  subject85.  The  controllers  need  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  accountability  as  to  their 
reasoning of the above.  

Example 28: A controller analyses big data sets to place customers in different segments depending 
on their online behaviour. In this situation, it can be assumed that the information that is the most 
important for the data subjects to obtain is information about what segment they have been put in. 
As a result, this information should be included in the first layer. The data in a raw format86 that has 
not yet been analysed or further processed, such as user activity on a website, is also personal data

86 See footnote 82.

covered by the right of access, however, it could in some cases be sufficient to provide this information 
in another layer.  

146.  For the use of layered approach to be considered as an appropriate measure, it is necessary that the 
data subject is informed at the outset that the information under Art. 15 is structured into different 
layers and provided with a description of what personal data and information that will be contained in 
the different layers. In this way it will be easier for the data subject to decide what layers they want to 
access. The description should objectively reflect all the categories of personal data that are actually 
processed  by  the  controller.  It  also  needs  to  be  clear  how  the  data  subject  can  get  access  to  the 
different layers. Access to the different layers shall not entail any disproportionate effort for the data 
subject and shall not be made conditional on the formulation of a new data subject request. This means 
that the data subjects must have the possibility to choose whether to access all layers at once or to 
access  one or two of the layers, if they are satisfied with this.  

Example 29: A data subject makes an access request to a video streaming service. The request is made 
through an option that is available when data subjects have logged into their account. The data subject 
is presented with two options which appear as buttons on the webpage. Option one is to download 
part 1 of the personal data and the  supplementary information. This contains, for example,  recent 
streaming history, account information and payment information. Option two is to download part 2 of 
the  personal  data  that  contains  technical  log  files  about  the  data  subjects  activities  and  historical 
information  on  the  account.  In  this  case,  the  controller  has  made  it  possible  for  data  subjects  to 
exercise their right in a way that does not create an extra burden for the data subject.  

Variation  1:  In  cases  where  the  data  subject  only  chooses  the  button  to  download  part  1  of  the 
personal data, the controller is obliged only to provide part 1 of the data. 

Variation 2: In cases where the data subject chooses the buttons for both part 1 and part 2 of the data, 
the  controller  cannot  communicate  only  part  1 of the  data  and ask  for  a  new confirmation  before 
communication of part  2 of the data. Instead both parts of the data must  be provided to the data 
subject, as it follows from the request made. 

147.  The use of a layered approach will not be considered appropriate for all controllers or in all situations. 
It should only be used when it would be difficult for the data subject to comprehend the information 
if given in its entirety. In other words, the controller needs to be able to demonstrate that the use of 
layered  approach  adds  value  for  the  data  subject  in  helping  them  understand  the  information 
provided.  A  layered  approach  would  therefore  only  be  considered  appropriate  when  a  controller 
processes a large quantity of personal data about the data subject making a request and where there 
would be apparent difficulties for the data subject to grasp or comprehend the information if it were 
to be provided all at once. The fact that it would require great effort and resources from the controller 
to provide the information under Art. 15 is not in itself an argument for using a layered approach.  

5.2.5  Format 

148.  According to Art. 12(1) GDPR, information under Art.15 shall be provided in writing or by other means 
including, where appropriate, by electronic means. As regards access to the personal data undergoing 
processing, Art. 15(3) states that where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and 
unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used 
electronic form. The GDPR does not specify what a commonly used electronic form is. Thus there are 
several conceivable formats that can be used. What is considered to be a commonly used electronic 
form will also vary over time.  

Adopted  

47 

 

149.  What  could  be  considered  as  a  commonly  used  electronic  form  should  be  based  on  an  objective 
assessment and not on what format the controller uses in its daily operations. In order to determine 
what format is to be considered as a commonly used format in the situation at hand, the controller 
will have to assess if there are specific formats generally used in the controller’s area of operation or 
in  the  given  context.  When  there  are  no  such  formats  generally  used,  open  formats  set  in  an 
international standard, such as ISO, should, in general, be considered as commonly used electronic 
formats.  However,  the  EDPB  does  not  exclude  the  possibility  that  other  formats  may  also  be 
considered to be commonly used within the meaning of Article 15(3). When assessing if a format is a 
commonly used electronic format, the EDPB considers that it is of importance how easily the individual 
can  access  information  provided  in  the  current  format.  In  this  regard  it  should  be  noted  what 
information the controller has provided to the data subject about how to access a file which has been 
provided in a specific  format,  such as what programs or software  that could be  used, to make  the 
format more accessible to the data subject. The data subject should, however, not be obliged to buy  
software in order to get access to the information.  

150.  When deciding upon the format in which the copy of the personal data and the information under 
Art. 15  should  be  provided,  the  controller  needs  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  format  must  enable  the 
information to be presented in a way that is both intelligible and easily accessible. It is important that 
the data subject is provided with information in embodied, permanent form (text, electronic). Since 
the information should persist over time, information in writing, including by electronic means, is, in 
principle,  preferable  over other  forms.  The  copy of the  personal  data  could, when  appropriate,  be 
stored on an electronic storage device such as CD or USB.  

151.  It should be noted that for a controller to be able to consider that data subjects have been provided 
with a copy of personal data it is not enough to have provided them with access to their personal data. 
For the requirement to provide a copy of personal data to be fulfilled and in case the data are provided 
electronically/digitally, the data subjects need to be able to download their data in a commonly used 
electronic form.  

152.  It is the responsibility of the controller to decide upon the appropriate form in which the personal data 
will be  provided.  The controller can, although is not necessarily obliged to, provide  the  documents 
which contain personal data about the data subjects making the request, in their original form. The 
controller could, for example, on a case-by-case basis, provide access to a copy of the medium as such, 
given the need for transparency (for example, to verify the accuracy of the data held by the controller 
in  the  event  of  a  request  for  access  to  the  medical  file  or  an  audio  recording  whose  transcript  is 
disputed). However, the CJEU, in its interpretation of the right of access under the Directive 95/46/EC, 
stated that “for [the right of access] to be complied with, it is sufficient for the applicant to be provided 
with a full summary of those data in an intelligible form, that is, a form which allows him to become 
aware  of  those  data  and  to  check  that  they  are  accurate  and  processed  in  compliance  with  that 
directive, so that he may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him”87. Unlike the directive, 
the GDPR expressly contains an obligation to provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data 
undergoing processing. This, however, does not mean that the data subject always has the right to 
obtain a copy of the documents containing the personal data, but an unaltered copy of the personal 
data being processed in these documents. 88 Such copy of the personal data could be provided through 
a compilation containing all personal data covered by the right of access as long as the compilation

307/21).

makes it possible for the data subject to be made aware and verify the lawfulness of the processing. 
Hence,  there  is  no  contradiction  between  the  wording  of  the  GDPR  and  the  ruling  by  the  CJEU 
regarding this matter. The word summary in the ruling should not be misinterpreted as meaning that 
the compilation would not encompass all data covered by the right of access, but is merely a way to 
present all that data without giving  access to the underlying documents which contain the personal 
data. Since the compilation needs to contain a copy of the personal data, it should be stressed that it 
cannot be made in a way that somehow alters or changes the content of the information.  

Example  30:  A  data  subject  has  been  insured  with  an  insurance  company  for  many  years.  Several 
insured incidents have occurred. In each case there has been some written correspondence through 
e-mail  between  the  data  subject  and  the  insurance  company.  As  the  data  subject  had  to  provide 
information regarding the specific circumstances of each incident, the correspondence entails a lot of 
personal  information  about  the  data  subject  (hobbies,  flatmates,  daily  habits  etc.).  In  some  cases 
disagreement arose about the insurance company’s obligation to compensate the data subject which 
caused  a  vast  amount  of  communication  back  and  forth.  All  this  correspondence  is  stored  by  the 
insurance company. The data subject makes an access request. In this situation the controller does not 
necessarily have to provide the e-mails in their original form by forwarding them to the data subject. 
Instead  the  controller  could  choose  to  compile  the  e-mail  correspondence  containing  the  data 
subject’s personal data in a file that is provided to the data subject.  

153.  Notwithstanding the form in which the controller provides the personal data, e.g. by  providing the 
actual documents containing the personal data or a compilation of the personal data, the information 
shall  comply  with  the  transparency  requirements  laid  down  in  Art. 12  GDPR. Making  some  kind  of 
compilation and/or extracting the data in a way that makes the information easy to comprehend could, 
in some cases, be a way to comply with these requirements. In other cases the information is better 
understood by providing a copy of the actual document containing the personal data. Hence which 
form is most suitable must be decided on a case by case basis. 

154.  In this context,  it is important to remember that there  is a distinction between the right  to obtain 
access under Art. 15 GDPR and the right to receive a copy of administrative documents regulated under 
national law, the latter being a right to  receive a copy of the actual document. This does not mean 
that  the  right  of  access  under  Art.  15  GDPR  excludes  the  possibility  to  receive  a  copy  of  the 
document/media on which the personal data appear.  

155.  In some cases, the personal data itself sets the requirements in what format the personal data should 
be provided. For example, when the personal data constitutes handwritten information by the data 
subject, the data subject may need to be provided with a photocopy of that handwritten information, 
as the handwriting itself is personal data. That could especially be the case when the handwriting is 
something that matters to the processing, e.g. scripture analysis. The same applies in general for audio 
recordings because the voice of the data subject itself is personal data. In some cases, however, access 
can be given by providing a transcription of the conversation, for example, if agreed upon between the 
data subject and the controller.  

156.  It  should  be  noted that  the  provisions  on  format  requirements  are  different  regarding  the  right  of 
access and the right of data portability. Whilst the right of data portability under Art. 20 GDPR requires 
that the information is provided in a machine readable format, the right to information under Art. 15 
does  not.  Hence,  formats  that  are  considered  not  to  be  appropriate  when  complying  with  a  data 
portability  request,  for  example  pdf-files,  could  still  be  suitable  when  complying  with  an  access 
request.

5.3  Timing for the provision of access  

157.  Art. 12(3) GDPR requires that the controller provides information to the data subject regarding action 
taken in respect of a request under Art. 15 without undue delay and in any event within one month of 
receipt of the request. This deadline can be extended by a maximum of two months taking into account 
the complexity and the number of the requests, provided that the data subject has been informed 
about the reasons for such delay within one month of the receipt of the request. This obligation to 
inform  the  data  subject  about  the  extension  and  its  reasons  should  not  be  confused  with  the 
information that has to be given without delay and at the latest within one month when the controller 
does not take action on the request, as detailed by Art. 12(4) GDPR. 

158.  The controller shall react and, as a general rule, provide the information under Art. 15 without undue 
delay, which means that the information should be given as soon as possible. This means that, if it is 
possible  to  provide  the  requested  information  in  a  shorter  amount  of  time  than  one  month,  the 
controller  should  do  so.  The  EDPB  also  considers  that  the  timing  to  answer  the  request  in  some 
situations must be adapted to the storage period in order to be able to provide access89.  

159.   The time limit starts when the controller has received an Art. 15 request, meaning when the request 
reaches the controller through one of its official channels.90 It is not necessary that the controller is in 
fact aware of the request. However, when the controller needs to communicate with the data subject 
due  to  the  uncertainty  regarding  the  identity  of  the  person  making  the  request  there  may  be  a 
suspension in time until the controller has obtained the information needed from the data subject, 
provided the controller has asked for additional information without undue delay. The same applies 
for  when  a  controller  has  asked  a  data  subject  to  specify  the  processing  operations  to  which  the 
request relates, when the conditions set out in Recital 63 are met. 91.  

Example  31:  Following  the  reception  of  the  request,  a  controller  reacts  immediately  and  asks  the 
information it needs to confirm the identity of the person making the request. The latter replies only 
several days later and the information that the data subject sends to verify the identity does not seem 
sufficient  which  requires  the  controller  to  ask  for  clarifications.  In  this  situation  there  will  be  a 
suspension in time until the controller has obtained enough information to verify the identity of the 
data subject.  

160.  The time period to respond to an access request needs to be calculated in accordance with Regulation 

No 1182/7192. 

Example 32: An organisation receives a request on 5 March. The time limit starts from the same day. 
This gives the organisation until and including 5 April to comply with the request, at the latest. 

 

                                                           

89 See section 2.3.3 
90 In some member states there is national law determining when a message is to be considered as received, 
taking into account weekends and national holidays. 
91 See further section 2.3.1. 
92 Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to 
periods, dates and time limits. 

Adopted  

50 

 

Example 33: If the organisation receives a request on 31 August, and as the following month is 
shorter there is no corresponding date, the date for response, at the latest, is the last day of the 
following month, hence 30 September. 

161.  If the last day of this time period falls on a weekend or a public holiday, the controller has until the 

next working day to respond. 

162.  Under certain circumstances the controller can extend the time to respond to a request of access by 
two further months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. It 
should be emphasised that this possibility is an exemption from the general rule and should not be 
overused. If controllers often find themselves forced to extend the time limit, it could be an indication 
of a need to further develop their general procedures to handle requests.  

163.  What constitutes a complex request varies depending upon the specific circumstances of each case. 

Some of the factors that could be considered relevant are for example: 

the amount of data processed by the controller, 

 
  how the information is stored, especially when it is difficult to retrieve the information, 

 

for example when data are processed by different units of the organisation, 
the  need  to  redact  information  when  an  exemption  applies,  for  example  information 
regarding other data subjects or that constitutes trade secrets, and 

  when the information requires further work in order to be intelligible. 

 

164.  The mere fact that complying with the request would require a large effort does not make a request 
complex.  Similarly,  the  fact  that  a  big  company  receives  a  large  number  of  requests  would  not 
automatically trigger an extension of the time limit. However, when a controller temporarily receives 
a large amount of requests, for example due to an extraordinary publicity regarding their activities, 
this could be regarded as a legitimate reason for prolonging the time of the response. Nevertheless, a 
controller,  especially  one  who  handles  a  large  quantity  of  data,  should  have  procedures  and 
mechanisms  in  place  in  order  to  be  able  to  handle  requests  within  the  time  limit  under  normal 
circumstances. 

6  LIMITS AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE RIGHT OF ACCESS  

6.1  General remarks 

165.  The right of access is subject to the limits that result from Art. 15(4) GDPR (rights and freedoms of 
others) and Art. 12 (5)  GDPR  (manifestly unfounded or excessive  requests). Furthermore, Union or 
Member  State  law  may  restrict  the  right  of  access  in  accordance  with  Art.  23  GDPR.  Derogations 
regarding the processing of personal data for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes or 
archiving purposes in the public interest can be based on Art. 89(2) and Art. 89(3) GDPR accordingly 
and derogations for processing carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic, artistic 
or literary expression can be based on Art. 85(2) GDPR.  

166.  It  is  important  to  note  that,  apart  from  the  above  mentioned  limits,  derogations  and  possible 
restrictions, the GDPR does not allow any further exemptions or derogations to the right of access. 
That means inter alia that the right of access is without any general reservation to proportionality with 
regard to the efforts the controller has to take to comply with the data subjects request under Art. 15 

Adopted  

51 

 

GDPR93. Furthermore, it is not permitted to limit or restrict the right of access in a contract between 
the controller and the data subject.  

167.  According to Recital 63, the right of access is granted to data subjects in order to be aware of, and 
verify,  the  lawfulness  of  the  processing.  The  right  of  access enables,  inter  alia,  the  data  subject  to 
obtain,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  the  rectification,  erasure  or  blocking  of  personal  data94. 
However,  data  subjects  are  not  obliged  to  give  reasons  or  to  justify  their  request.  As  long  as  the 
requirements  of  Art.  15  GDPR  are  met  the  purposes  behind  the  request  should  be  regarded  as 
irrelevant95.  

6.2  Article 15 (4) GDPR 

 

168.  According  to  Art.  15(4)  GDPR,  the  right  to  obtain  a  copy  shall  not  adversely  affect  the  rights  and 
freedoms  of others.  Explanations  about  this  limitation  are  given  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  sentences  of 
Recital  63.  That  right  should  not  adversely  affect  the  rights  or  freedoms  of  others,  including  trade 
secrets  or 
in  particular  the  copyright  protecting  the  software. 
However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the 
data subject. When interpreting Art. 15(4) GDPR special caution has to be taken not to unjustifiably 
widen the restrictions laid down in Art. 23 GDPR, which are permissible only under strict conditions.  

intellectual  property  and 

169.  Art. 15(4) GDPR applies to the right to obtain a copy of the data, which is the main modality of giving 
access to the data processed (second component of the right of access). It is also applicable, and rights 
and  freedoms of others  shall  be  taken  into  account,  if  access  to  the  personal  data  is  exceptionally 
granted by other means than a copy. For example, there is no difference justified whether trade secrets 
are affected by providing a copy or by granting on site access to the data subject. Art. 15(4) GDPR is 
not applicable to the additional information on the processing as stated in Art. 15(1) lit. a.-h. GDPR. 

170.  According to Recital 63, conflicting rights and freedoms include trade secrets or intellectual property 
and in particular the copyright protecting the software. These explicitly mentioned rights and freedoms 
should  be  regarded  merely  as  examples,  as,  in  principle,  any  right  or  freedom  based  on  Union  or 
Member State law may be considered to invoke the limitation of Art. 15(4) GDPR96. Thus, the right to 
the  protection  of  personal  data  (Art.  8  European  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights)  can  also  be 
considered as an affected right in terms of Art. 15(4) GDPR. Regarding the right to obtain a copy, the 
right  to  data  protection  of  others  is  a  typical  case  where  the  limitation  needs  to  be  assessed. 
Furthermore, the right to confidentiality of correspondence has to be taken into account, for example 
with regard to private e-mail-correspondence in the employment context97. It is important to note that 
not every interest amounts to “rights and freedoms” pursuant to Art. 15(4) GDPR. For example, the 
economic  interests  of  a  company  not  to  disclose  personal  data  do  not  reach the  threshold  for  the 

                                                           

93 Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, as mentioned in 
recital 63 GDPR, the controller may request the data subject to specify the information or processing activities 
to which the request relates. See also section 2.3.1.  
94 CJEU, Joined Cases C-141/12 and C-372/12, YS and Others.  
95 This is without prejudice to any applicable national law that comply with the requirements posed by Art. 23 
GDPR, see Chapter 6.4.  
96 The weight or priority of the conflicting rights and freedoms is not a question of the definition of the terms 
“rights and freedoms“. However, balancing of such interests is part of a second step of the assessment, whether 
Art. 15(4) is applicable. See para. 173 below.  
97 ECHR, Bărbulescu v. Romania, no 61496/08, para. 80, 5 September 2017.

recourse to the excemption in Art. 15(4) as long as there are no trade secrets, intellectual property or 
other protected rights affected.  

171.   “Others” means any other person or entity apart from the data subject who is exercising their right of 
access. Hence, the rights and freedoms of the controller or processor (in keeping trade secrets and 
intellectual  property  confidential  for  example)  might  be  considered.  If  the  EU  legislator  wanted  to 
exclude controllers or processors rights and freedoms, it would have used the term “third party”, which 
is defined in Art. 4(10) GDPR. 

172.  The  general  concern  that  rights  and  freedoms  of  others  might  be  affected  by  complying  with  the 
request  for  access,  is  not  enough  to  rely  on  Art.  15  (4)  GDPR.  The  controller  must  be  able  to 
demonstrate that in the concrete situation, rights or freedoms of others would, in fact, be impacted.  

Example 34: A person who is now an adult was cared for by the youth welfare office over a number of 
years  in  the  past.  The  corresponding  files  may  possibly  contain  sensitive  information  about  other 
persons (parents,  social workers, other minors). However, a request  for information from the  data 
subject cannot  generally be  rejected for this reason with reference to Art. 15(4) GDPR. Rather, the 
rights  and freedoms of others must  be examined in detail and demonstrated by the youth welfare 
office as the controller. Depending on the interests in question and their relative weight, providing 
such specific information may be rejected (e.g. by redacting names).  

173.  With  regard  to  Recital  4  GDPR  and  the  rationale  behind  Art.  52(1)  of  the  European  Charter  of 
Fundamental Rights, the right to protection of personal data is not an absolute right98. Hence also the 
exercise of the right of access has to be balanced against other fundamental rights in accordance with 
the principle of proportionality. When the Art. 15(4) GDPR assessment proves that complying with the 
request has adverse (negative) effects on other participants’ rights and freedoms (step 1), the interests 
of all participants need to be weighed taking into account the specific circumstances of the case and 
in particular the likelihood and severity of the risks present in the  communication of the data.  The 
controller  should  try  to  reconcile  the  conflicting  rights  (step  2),  for  example  through  the 
implementation of appropriate measures mitigating the risk to the rights and freedoms of others. As 
emphasised in Recital 63, protecting the rights and freedoms of others by virtue of Art. 15(4) GDPR 
should not result in a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. This means, for example, 
where the limitation applies, that information concerning others has to be rendered illegible as far as 
possible instead of refusing to provide a copy of the personal data. However, if it is impossible to find 
a solution of reconciliation of the relevant rights, the controller has to decide in a next step which of 
the conflicting rights and freedoms prevails (step 3).  

Example 35: A retailer offers its clients the possibility to order products via a hotline operated by its 
customer service. For the purpose of proving the commercial transactions, the retailer stores a call 
recording, in accordance with the strict requirements of applicable legislation. A customer wants to 
receive a copy of the conversation he had with an agent of the customer service. In a first step, the 
retailer analyses the request and realises that the record contains personal data that also relate to 
someone else, namely to the agent of the customer service.  In a second step, in order to assess 
whether  providing  the  copy  would  affect  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  others,  the  retailer  has  to 
balance  the  conflicting  interests,  especially  taking  into  account  the  likelihood  and  severity  of 
possible  risks  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  customer  service  agent,  that  are  present  in  the 
communication  of  the  record  to  the  client.  The  retailer  concludes  that  there  are  very  limited 
                                                           

98 See, for example, also CJEU, Joined cases C-92/09 and C-93/09, Volker und Markus Schecke GbR and Hartmut 
Eifert v. Land Hessen [GC], 9 November 2010, para. 48.

personal  data  relating  to  the  customer  service  agent  in  the  record,  only  his  voice.  The 
retailer/controller  finds  that  the  agent  is  not  easily  identifiable.  Moreover,  the  content  of  the 
discussion is of a professional nature and the data subject was the interlocutor. On the basis of the 
aforementioned circumstances the controller objectively concludes that the right to access does not 
adversely affect the rights and freedoms of the agent of the customer service and therefore, the 
controller may provide the data subject with the full record, including the parts of the voice record 
that relate to the agent of the customer service. 

 

Example 36: A client of a medical supply store wants access to the measuring results concerning 
her legs on the basis of Art. 15 GDPR. The medical supply store had measured the data subject’s 
legs in order to craft individual medical compression stockings. Apparently the medical supply 
store had a lot of experience and had established a special technique to measure accurately. After 
the measuring in the medical supply store, the client wants to use the measuring results to buy 
cheaper socks elsewhere (ordering them in an online-shop). The medical supply store partially 
refuses access to the data on the basis of Art. 15(4) GDPR claiming that due to their special, 
accurate measuring techniques the results were protected as trade secrets. If and in so far the 
controller is able to prove that: 

  providing  the  data  subject  with  information  about  the  measuring  results  is  not 

 

possible without revealing how the measurements were taken and 
the information about how the measurements were taken including, if relevant, the 
exact determination of the measuring points are trade secrets 

they may apply Art. 15(4) GDPR.  

The  controller  would  still  have  to  provide  as  much  information  as  it  could  about  the  measuring 
results that would not reveal its trade secret, even if that would imply the effort to revise and edit 
the results. 

 

Example 37: GAMER X  is registered as a user on the gaming platform of PLATFORM Y. One day, 
GAMER X is notified that his online account has been restricted. As he is unable to log in anymore, 
GAMER X asks the controller for access to all personal data relating to him. In addition, GAMER X 
requires access to the reasons for the account restriction. PLATFORM Y, the controller of the online 
gaming platform with which the request has been lodged, informs the users in its general terms and 
conditions  available  on  its  website,  that  any  kind  of  cheating  (mainly  by  the  use  of  third  party 
software) will entail a temporal or permanent ban from its platform. PLATFORM Y also informs the 
users in its privacy policy about the processing of personal data for the purpose of detecting gaming 
cheats, in accordance with the requirements set out in Art. 13 GDPR.  

Upon receipt of GAMER X’s request for access, PLATFORM Y should provide GAMER X with a copy 
of the personal data processed about GAMER X. Regarding the reason for the account restriction, 
PLATFORM Y should confirm GAMER X that it decided to restrict GAMER X’s access to online games 
due to the use of one or repeated gaming cheats which are in violation with the general terms of 
use. In addition to the information provided about the processing for the purpose of gaming cheat 
detection, PLATFORM Y should grant GAMER X access to the information it has stored about GAMER 
X’s gaming cheats which led to the restriction. In particular, PLATFORM Y should provide GAMER X 
with the information that led to the restriction of the account (e.g. log overview, date and time of 

Adopted  

54 

 

 

cheating, detection of third party software,…) in order for the data subject (i.e. GAMER X) to verify 
that the data processing has been accurate.  

However, according to Art. 15(4) GDPR and Recital 63 GDPR, PLATFORM Y is not bound to reveal 
any part of the  technical operation of the anti-cheat software even if this information relates to 
GAMER X, as long as this is can be regarded as trade secrets. The necessary balancing of interests 
under  Art.  15(4)  GDPR  will  have  the  result  that  the  trade  secrets  of  PLATFORM  Y  preclude  the 
disclosure  of  this  personal  data  because  knowledge  of  the  technical  operation  of  the  anti-cheat 
software could also allow the user to circumvent future cheat or fraud detection99. 

174.  If controllers refuse to act on a request for the right of access in whole or in part under Art. 15(4) GDPR, 
they have to inform the data subject of the reasons without delay and at the latest within one month 
(Art. 12(4) GDPR). The explanatory statement has to refer to the concrete circumstances in order to 
allow the data subjects to assess whether they want to take action against the refusal. It must include 
information about the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR) 
and seeking judicial remedy (Art. 79 GDPR).  

6.3  Article 12(5) GDPR 

175.  Art. 12(5) GDPR enables controllers to override  requests for the right of access that are manifestly 
unfounded  or  excessive.  These  concepts  have  to  be  interpreted  narrowly,  as  the  principles  of 
transparency and cost free data subjects rights must not be undermined.  

176.  Controllers  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  to  the  individual  why  they  consider  that  the  request  is 
manifestly unfounded or excessive and, if asked, explain the reasons to the competent supervisory 
authority. Each request should be considered on a case by case basis in the context in which it is made 
in order to decide if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive. 

6.3.1  What does manifestly unfounded mean? 

177.  A  request  for the  right of access  is manifestly  unfounded,  if  the  requirements of  Art. 15  GDPR  are 
clearly and obviously not met when applying an objective approach. However, as explained especially 
in section 3 above, there are only very few prerequisites for requests for the right of access. Therefore, 
the EDPB emphasises that there is only very limited scope for relying on the “manifestly unfounded” 
alternative of Art. 12(5) GDPR in terms of requests for the right of access. 

178.  Furthermore, it is important to recall that prior to invoking the restriction, controllers must carefully 
analyse  the  content  and  scope  of  the  request.  For  example,  a  request  should  not  be  regarded  as 
manifestly unfounded if the request is related to the processing of personal data not subject to the 
GDPR (in this case, the request should not be dealt with as an Art. 15-request at all). 

                                                           

99 The extent of the information provided to individuals will be heavily context dependent, taking into account 
the nature of the controller and the nature of the breach of the terms of service. In some cases, it may only be 
possible  for  the  controller  to  provide  basic  information  in  response  to  an  access  request  to  which  Art.  15(4) 
applies. 

Adopted

179.  Other  cases  in  which  the  applicability  of  Art.  12(5)  GDPR  is  questionable  are  requests  related  to 
information  or  processing  activities  that  are  clearly  and  obviously  not  subject  to  the  processing 
activities of the controller.  

Example  38:  A  data  subject  addresses  a  request  to a  municipal  authority  concerning  data  that  are 
processed by a state authority. Instead of arguing that the request is manifestly unfounded it would 
be more suitable as well as easier for the authority addressed to confirm that these data are not being 
processed  by  the  authority  (first  component  of  Art.  15  GDPR:  “whether”  personal  data  are  being 
processed)100.  

180.  A controller should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the data subject has 
previously submitted requests which have  been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it  includes 
unobjective or improper language. 

6.3.2  What does excessive mean? 

181.  There is no definition of the term “excessive” in the GDPR. On the one hand, the wording “in particular 
because  of  their  repetitive  character”  in  Art.  12(5)  GDPR  allows  for  the  conclusion  that  the  main 
scenario for application of this limb with regard to Art. 15 GDPR is linked to the quantity of requests of 
a data subject for the right of access. On the other hand, the aforementioned phrasing shows that 
other reasons that might cause excessiveness are not excluded a priori. 

182.  Certainly, according to Art. 15(3) GDPR regarding the right to obtain a copy, a data subject may submit 
more than one request to a controller101. In the event of requests that could potentially be regarded 
as excessive, the assessment of “excessiveness” depends on the analysis carried out by the controller 
and the specifics of the sector in which it operates. 

183.  In case of subsequent requests, it has to be assessed whether the threshold of reasonable intervals 
(see  Recital  63)  has  been  exceeded  or  not.  Controllers  must  take  into  account  the  particular 
circumstances of each case carefully.  

184.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  social  networks,  a  change  in  the  data  set  will  be  expected  at  shorter 
intervals  than  in  the  case  of  land  registers  or  central  company  registers.  In  the  case  of  business 
associates,  the  frequency  of  contacts  with  the  customer  should  be  considered.  Accordingly  the 
“reasonable  intervals”  within  which  data  subjects  may  again  exercise  their  right  of  access  are  also 
different. The more often changes occur in the database of the controller, the more often data subjects 
may be permitted to request access to their personal data without it being excessive. On the other 
hand,  a  second  request  by  the  same  data  subject  could  be  considered  to  be  repetitive  in  certain 
circumstances.  

185.  When deciding whether a reasonable interval has elapsed, controllers should consider the following in 

the light of the reasonable expectations of the data subject: 

  how often the data is altered – is information unlikely to have changed between requests? If 
a data pool is obviously not subject to a processing other than storage and the data subject is 

                                                           

100 A different question is whether the authority which the access request was addressed to is entitled to transmit 
the request to the competent state authority.  
101 According to the second sentence of Article 15(3), the controller may charge a  reasonable fee for further 
copies requested.

 

aware of this, e.g. because of a previous request for the right of access, this might be an 
indication for an excessive request; 

the nature of the data – this could include whether it is particularly sensitive; 

the purposes of the processing – these could include whether the processing is likely to 
cause detriment (harm) to the requester if disclosed; 

  whether the subsequent requests concern the same type of information or processing 

activities or different ones102.  

Example 39 (carpenter): A data subject lodges access requests every two months with the carpenter 
that  manufactured  a  table  for  them.  The  carpenter  answered  the  first  request  completely.  When 
deciding  whether  a  reasonable  interval  has  elapsed,  one  should  consider  that  the  carpenter  only 
occasionally (first bullet point above) and not as part of its core activity processes and collects personal 
data  and  it  is  even  less  likely  that  the  carpenter  often  provides  services  to  the  same  data  subject. 
Indeed, in the case, the carpenter did not provide more than one service to the data subject, rendering 
it unlikely that changes occurred in the dataset concerning the data subject. Notably given the nature 
and amount of the personal data processed, the risks related to the processing can be considered as 
low  (second  bullet  point  above),  such  as  the  purpose  of  the  processing  (billing  purposes  and 
compliance with obligation to keep records) is not likely to cause detriment to the data subject (third 
bullet point above). The request furthermore concerns the same information as the last request (forth 
bullet  point  above).  Such  requests  may  as  a  consequence  be  regarded  as  excessive  due  to  their 
repetitiveness. 

 

Example 40 (social media platform):  A social media platform whose core business is the collection 
and/or processing of personal data of the data subject carries out large-scale complex and continuous 
processing activities. A data subject that uses the services of the platform lodges access requests every 
three months. In this case, frequent changes to the personal data relating to the data subject are highly 
likely (first bullet point above), the broad range of collected data includes inferred sensitive personal 
data (second bullet point above) processed for the purpose of showing relevant content and network 
members to the data subject  (third bullet point). Access requests every three months may  -  under 
these circumstances - in principle not be regarded as excessive due to repetitiveness. 

 

Example 41 (credit agencies): As with social networks, it cannot be ruled out that modifications of 
the relevant data held by credit agencies will occur at much shorter intervals than in other areas (first 
bulletpoint above). This results from numerous factors of which the data subject, as a person from 
outside, is usually not aware due to the complexity of the business model. The answer to the 
question as to which types of data were collected for a score value calculation by the controller and 
which are currently included in the calculation can therefore only be provided by the credit agency 
itself. In addition, data processing through credit  agencies and the resulting score value can have far-
reaching consequences for the data subject with regard to intended legal transactions, such as the 
conclusion of purchasing, rent or leasing contracts (third bullet point above).  

                                                           

102 If the subsequent request concerns the same type of information in scope AND time, this is not a question of 
excessiveness but a question of request for an additional copy, see section 2.2.2.2.

It is not possible to generally determine any specific interval in which the submission of a further 
access request could be deemed excessive under Art. 12(5) second sentence GDPR. An overall 
consideration of the circumstances of the individual case is rather required. However, given the 
importance of data processing for the data subjects’ reality of everyday life, it can be assumed that a 
one-year interval between information provided free of charge will in any case be too large for the 
request to be considered excessive. If a request is submitted within a very short interval, the decisive 
factor should be whether the data subject has reason to assume that the information or the 
processing has changed since the last request. For example, if the data subject has conducted a 
financial transaction, such as taking a loan, the data subject should be entitled to request access to 
the credit information even though such a request was submitted and responded to shortly before.  

186.  When it is possible to provide the information easily by electronic means or by remote access to a 
secure system, which means that complying with such requests actually doesn’t strain the controller, 
it is unlikely that subsequent requests can be regarded as excessive. 

187.  If a request overlaps with a previous request, the overlapping request can generally be regarded as 
excessive,  if  and  insofar  as  it  covers  exactly  the  same  information  or  processing  activities  and  the 
previous request is not yet complied with by the controller without reaching the state of “undue delay” 
(see Art. 12(3) GDPR). In practice, as a consequence both requests could be combined.  

188.  The fact that it would take the controller a vast amount of time and effort to provide the information 
or the copy to the data subject cannot on its own render a request excessive103. A large number of 
processing activities typically implicates bigger efforts when complying with access requests. However, 
as  stated  above,  under  certain  circumstances  requests  can  be  regarded  as  excessive  due  to  other 
reasons than their repetitive character. In the view of the EDPB this encompasses particularly cases of 
abusively relying on Art. 15 GDPR, which means cases in which data subjects make an excessive use of 
the right of access with the only intent of causing damage or harm to the controller.  

189.  Against this background, a request should not be regarded as excessive on the ground that:  

  no reasons are given by the data subject for the request or the controller regards the request 

as meaningless;  

improper or impolite language is used by the data subject; 

the data subject intends to use the data to file further claims against the controller.104  

 

 

190.  On the other hand, a request may be found excessive, for example, if: 

  an individual makes a request, but at the same time offers to withdraw it in return for some 

form of benefit from the controller or 

 

the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass the controller or its employees 
with no other purposes than to cause disruption, for example based on the fact that:

GDPR, see Chapter 6.4.

the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, 
that it intends to cause disruption and nothing else; or 

the  individual  systematically  sends  different  requests  to  a  controller  as  part  of  a 
campaign, e.g. once a week, with the intention and the effect of causing disruption105. 

6.3.3  Consequences  

191.  In  case  of  a  manifestly  unfounded  or  excessive  request  for  the  right  of  access  controllers  may, 
according to Art. 12(5) GDPR, either charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative 
costs of providing information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to comply 
with the request. 

192.  The  EDPB  points  out  that  controllers  are  –  on  the  one  hand  –  not  generally  obliged  to  charge  a 
reasonable fee before refusing to act on a request. On the other hand, they aren´t completely free to 
choose between the two alternatives either. In fact, controllers have to make an adequate decision 
depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Whereas it is hardly imaginable that charging a 
reasonable fee is a suitable measure in case of manifestly unfounded requests, for excessive requests 
– in line with the principle of transparency – it will often be more appropriate to charge a fee as a 
compensation for the administrative costs the repetitive requests are causing.  

193.  Controllers must be able to demonstrate the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of a request 
(Art. 12(5) third sentence GDPR). Hence, it is recommended to ensure proper documentation of the 
underlying facts. In line with Art. 12(4) GDPR, if controllers refuse to act on an access request in whole 
or partly, they must inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt 
of the request of  

 

 

 

the reason why, 

the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, 

the possibility to seek a judicial remedy. 

194.  Before charging a reasonable fee based on Art. 12(5) GDPR, controllers should provide an indication 
of their plan to do so to the data subjects. The latter have to be enabled to decide whether they will 
withdraw the request to avoid being charged.  

195.  Unjustified  rejections  of  requests  of  the  right  of  access  can  be  regarded  as  infringements  of  data 
subject rights pursuant to Art. 12 to 22 GDPR and can therefore be subject to the exercise of corrective 
powers  by competent  supervisory  authorities,  including  administrative  fines  based  on  Art.  83(5)(b) 
GDPR. If data subjects consider there is an infringement of their data subject rights, they have the right 
to lodge a complaint based on Art. 77 GDPR. 

   

                                                           

105 “Systematically sending as part of a campaign” means that requests which could easily be combined to one 
are artificially split into not just a few but many single pieces by the data subject with the apparent intention to 
cause disruption.

6.4  Possible restrictions in Union or Member States law based on Article 23 GDPR 

and derogations 

196.  The  scope  of  the  obligations  and  rights  provided  for  in  Art.  15  GDPR  may  be  restricted  by  way  of 

legislative measures in Union or Member States law106.  

197.  Controllers,  who  plan  to  rely  on  a  restriction  based  on  national  law  must  carefully  check  the 
requirements of the provision of the respective national legislation. Furthermore, it is important to 
note, that restrictions of the right of access in Member States (or Union) law which are based on Art. 23 
GDPR must strictly fulfil the conditions laid down in this provision. The EDPB has issued the Guidelines 
10/2020 on restrictions under Art. 23 GDPR with further explanations on this. In terms of the right of 
access, the EDPB recalls that controllers should lift the restrictions as soon as the circumstances that 
justify them no longer apply107.  

198.  Legislative measures which relate to restrictions under Art. 23 GDPR may also foresee that the exercise 
of a right is delayed in time, that a right is exercised partially or circumscribed to certain categories of 
data or that a right can be exercised indirectly through an independent supervisory authority108.

the Norwegian Personal Data Act and  chapter 5 of the Swedish Data Protection Act.

authority doesn´t provide information to a data subject complying with a request for the right of access because 
of certain restrictions, such information shall be provided to the federal supervisory authority at the request of 
the data subject, unless the responsible supreme federal authority (of the authority which was subject to the 
request) determines in the individual case that doing so would endanger the security of the Federation or a Land. 
The  Italian  DPCode  provides  for  indirect  access  (through  the  authority)  in  case  the  access  could  impact  with 
adverse consequence on a number of interests (e.g. Interest to contrast money laundering) see Art. 2-L of the 
Italian DPCode.
