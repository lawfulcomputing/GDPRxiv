A. Facts and procedure 

A.1. - Complaints against Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe 

1. 

In  the  course  of  2019,  a  series  of  complaints  were  filed  against  Interactive  Advertising 

Bureau Europe (hereinafter IAB Europe), for breaching various provisions of the  GDPR in 

relation to large-scale processing of personal data. The complaints related, in particular, to 

the  principles  of  legality,  appropriateness,  transparency,  purpose  limitation,  storage 

restriction and security, as well as to accountability. 

2. 

Nine identical or very similar complaints were filed, four directly with the Data Protection 

Authority  (hereinafter  'DPA')  and  five  via  the  IMI  system  with  supervisory  authorities  in 

other EU countries. 

3. 

The  Inspection  Service  also  carried  out  investigations  on  its  own  initiative,  pursuant  to 

Article 63(6) DPA Act. Since the complaints related to the same subject matter and were 

directed  against  the  same  party  (IAB  Europe),  on  the  basis  of  the  principles  of 

proportionality  and  necessity  in  the  conduct  of  investigations  (Article  64  DPA  Act),  the 

Inspection  Service  merged  the  above  files  into  one  case  under  file  number  DOS-2019-

01377. 

4. 

The complainants have agreed to this merger, as well as to the request by the  Litigation 

Chamber to merge their submission and submit them as a joint package, in the interests of 

economy and efficient proceedings. 

5. 

In this international case, four complainants, including the NGO Ligue des Droits Humains, 

are  domiciled  in  Belgium,  one  in  Ireland,  four  in  different  EU  states,  represented  by  the 

Polish-based NGO Panoptykon, and one complainant is represented by the Dutch-based 

NGO Bits of Freedom.  

6. 

Pursuant to Article 4(1) DPA Act, the Data Protection Authority is responsible for monitoring 

the data protection principles contained in the GDPR and in other laws containing provisions 

on the protection of the processing of personal data.  

7. 

Pursuant  to  Article  32  DPA  Act,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  the  administrative  dispute 

resolution body of the DPA1.  

8. 

Pursuant to Articles 51 et seq. GDPR and Article 4(1) of the DPA Act, it is the task of the 

Litigation Chamber, as the administrative dispute resolution body of the DPA, to exercise 

effective control over the application of the GDPR and to protect the fundamental rights 

 

 

1 The administrative nature of the disputes before the Litigation Chamber has been confirmed by the Market Court. See in 
particular the judgment of 12 June 2019, published on the website of the DPA, as well as decision 17/2020 of the Litigation 
Chamber.

and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data and to 

facilitate the free flow of personal data within the European Union. These tasks are further 

explained in the Strategic Plan and the management plans of the DPA, drawn up pursuant 

to Article 17(2) DPA Act. 

9.

Moreover,  as  regards  the  one-stop-shop  mechanism,  Article  56  GDPR  states:  "Without 

prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single 

establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory 

authority  for  the  cross-border  processing  carried  out  by  that  controller  or  processor  in 

accordance with the procedure provided in Article 60."

10.

Article 4.23 GDPR clarifies the notion of cross-border processing in the following terms: 

"processing  of  personal  data  which  takes  place  in  the  context  of  the  activities  of 

establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union 

where  the  controller  or  processor  is  established  in  more  than  one  Member  State;  or  (b) 

processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single 

establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is 

likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State;"

11.

The defendant has its only registered office in Belgium, but its activities have a significant 

impact on stakeholders in several Member States, including the plaintiffs in Ireland, Poland 

and the Netherlands, as  well as in Belgium. The  Litigation Chamber draws its jurisdiction 

from a combined reading of Articles 56 and 4(23)(b) of the GDPR. The DPA was seized by 

the Polish, Dutch and Irish data protection authorities following a complaint made to them 

by the complainants in accordance with Article 77.1 of the GDPR. It declares that it is the 

lead supervisory authority (Article 60 of the GDPR).

12.

The following supervisors have indicated their willingness to act as concerned supervisory 

authorities  (CSA):  the  Netherlands,  Latvia,  Italy,  Sweden,  Slovenia,  Norway,  Hungary, 

Poland,  Portugal,  Denmark,  France,  Finland,  Greece,  Spain,  Luxemburg,  Czech  Republic, 

Austria,  Croatia,  Cyprus,  and  Germany  (Berlin,  Rhineland-Palatinate,  North  Rhine-

Westphalia,  Saarland,  Lower  Saxony,  Brandenburg,  Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania, 

Bavaria), Ireland.

13.

In the course of the proceedings, additional complaints with a very similar focus to the ones 

on  which  the  present  case  is  based  were  sent  to  the  Belgian  DPA,  by  the  Maltese, 

Romanian,  Croatian,  Greek,  Portuguese,  Swedish,  Cypriot  and  Italian  DPAs.  These 

complaints are not part of the present proceedings.

A.2.  -  The  language  of  the  procedure:  Interim  Decision  01/2021  as  amended  by  the  Interim 

Decision 26/2021 of 23 February 2021 

14.  On 13 October 2020, the Litigation Chamber sent a letter to the parties, in accordance with 

Article 98 DPA Act,  informing the parties of the language of the procedure (French), and 

inviting them to present their written submissions.  

15. 

 In response to a request by the complainants dd. 27 November 2020, and in view of the 

international nature of this case, the Litigation Chamber issued Interim Decision 01/2021 on 

8  January  2021  regarding  the  language  of  the  proceedings.  Following  an  appeal  by  the 

complainants to the Market Court, this Interim Decision was amended on 23 February 2021 

(Interim Decision 26/2021).  

16.  Pursuant to the latter Interim Decision, which is based on an agreement with the parties, the 

DPA's correspondence with the parties is conducted in Dutch and the preliminary and final 

decisions of the  Litigation Chamber  are in Dutch.  However, the  Litigation Chamber  shall 

provide the parties with a French and an English translation of the final decision. 

17.  Moreover, the parties are free to use the language of their choice (Dutch, French or English) 

in the proceedings before the Litigation Chamber, either in writing or orally. In the case of 

IAB Europe, it is French or English.  The DPA is not responsible for translations of procedural 

documents submitted by one party on behalf of the other. 

18. 

Finally,  the  Litigation  Chamber  points  out  that  it  sometimes  uses  English  language 

terminology  in  this  decision,  in  cases  where  translation  into  Dutch  would  reduce  the 

comprehensibility of the decision.    

 

A.3. - RTB and TCF  

19. 

In  essence,  this  case  concerns,  on  the  one  hand,  the  conformity  of  the  Transparency  & 

Consent  Framework  (hereinafter,  ‘TCF’)  with  the  GDPR  and,  more  specifically,  the 

responsibility of IAB Europe, the defendant in these proceedings, and other various actors 

involved. In addition, it also pertains to the impact of the TCF on the so-called Real-Time 

Bidding (RTB). Given the complexity of the latter, it is introduced here. 

A.3.1. - Definitions and operation of the Real-Time Bidding system 

20. 

In  contrast  to  "traditional"  advertising,  where  the  parties 

involved  manually  and 

contractually  determine  the  modalities  of  information  exchange,  online  advertising  is 

6 

usually  done  primarily  automatically  and  behind  the  scenes,  through  "Programmatic 

advertising" methods of which real-time bidding (RTB) is the leading system2.  

21.  Real-time bidding is defined in legal literature as "a network of partners that enables big 

data  applications  within  the  organisational  field  of  marketing  to  improve  sales  of  pre-

determined  advertising  space through real-time data-driven marketing  and personalised 

(behavioural) advertising"3.  

22.  Real-time bidding refers to the use of an instantaneous automated online auction for the 

sale and purchase of online advertising space. Specifically, it means that when an individual 

accesses a website or  application that contains an advertising  space,  behind the scenes 

through  an  automated  online  auction  system  and  algorithms,  technology  companies 

representing  thousands of advertisers can instantly (in  real  time) bid  for that advertising 

space to display targeted advertising specifically tailored to that individual's profile.  

23.  Real-time bidding works behind the scenes on most commercial websites and mobile apps. 

Thousands of companies are involved that receive information about the person visiting the 

website. In this way, billions of advertisements are auctioned every day. 

24. 

In a real-time bidding system, several parties are involved4: 

A.  The companies or organisations that have created and manage the relevant real-time 

bidding  system,  including  by  setting  its  policies/governance  and  technical  protocols. 

The main ones are: 

a.  the "OpenRTB" system and the associated "Advertising Common Object Model" 

(AdCOM), created by IAB Technology Laboratory, Inc. (abbreviated as "IAB Tech 

Lab") and Interactive Advertising Bureau, Inc. (abbreviated as "IAB"), both based in 

New York;  

b.  the "Authorised Buyers" system created by Google. 

The OpenRTB is a standard protocol that aims to simplify the interconnection between ad 

space providers, publishers (ad exchanges, Sell-Side Platforms, or networks working with 

publishers),  and  competing  buyers  of  ad  space  (bidders,  Demand-Side  Platforms,  or

networks  working  with  advertisers).  The  overall  objective  of  OpenRTB  is  to  establish  a 

common language for communication between buyers and vendors of advertising space5. 

B.  On the "supply side" there are: 

a.  Companies that own a website or app with advertising space. In RTB jargon, these 

companies are called "publishers". 

b.  Companies operating an automated online platform through which publishers can 

optimise the value and volume of their ad space sales by signalling the availability 

of their ad space to be displayed to a data subject and requesting that one or more 

bid requests be made for that ad space. In RTB jargon, these companies are called 

"Sell-Side  Platforms"  ("SSPs").  SSPs  provide  the  available  inventory  of  their 

publishers to the various ad exchanges in the market and possibly to ad networks 

and other DSPs. The most advanced SSPs work in real time. As soon as an ad space 

is called up when a page is viewed on a publisher's site, the SSP searches for the 

best offer on that type of ad space according to the detected visitor profile, and 

automatically delivers the corresponding ad6. 

C.  On the "demand side" there are: 

a.  Companies  that  want  to  display  advertising  for  their  products  or  services  in  a 

targeted manner to visitors to websites and users of apps (the advertisers). 

b.  Companies  operating  an  online  platform  that  enables  advertisers  and  media 

agencies  to  carry  out  and  optimise  their  purchases  of  advertising  space,  and  in 

which  advertisers'  ads  are  offered7.  In  RTB  jargon,  these  companies  are  called 

"Demand-Side Platforms" ("DSPs"). 

D.  Acting  as  intermediaries  between  them  are  companies,  so-called  "Ad  Exchanges", 

which  bring  the  supply  and  demand  side  organisations  together  and  allow  them  to 

communicate with each other automatically so that the DSPs can bid on bid requests 

from SSPs. 

E. 

In  addition,  there  are  so-called  "Data  Management  Platforms"  ("DMPs")  that  extract 

huge amounts and types of personal data from multiple sources (such as from devices, 

cookies, mobile identifiers, pixels, online surfing behaviour analysis, social media, offline 

data, but also from third parties such as data brokers, etc.), then centralise this data, and 

finally analyse and categorise it by means of algorithms and artificial intelligence. By

using  a  DMP,  an  advertiser  can  enrich  and  combine  data  that  it  himself  has  about 

(potential) customers with data that it can get from a central DMP. Thus, one of the main 

functions of a DMP is to create detailed consumer profiles through data enrichment in 

order  to  optimise  the  targeting  and  effectiveness  of  marketing  and  advertising 

campaigns and to provide personalised offers on websites and in applications8. 

25.  After an advertiser has drawn up detailed consumer profiles via a DMP, it bids via its DSP 

for  bid  requests  from  publishers/SSPs  offering  advertising  space  that  matches  those 

consumer profiles. 

26. 

In RTB jargon, SSPs, DSPs, Ad Exchanges, advertisers and DMPs are collectively referred 

to as "Vendors". 

27.  Schematically this can be presented as follows9: 

 
28.  This can also be represented as follows10:

29.  The content of a bid request, which contains data about online users, their device and the 

websites  visited,  is  captured  by  the  OpenRTB  system  or  the  Authorised  Buyers  system. 

Generally, the following categories of personal data can be communicated in a bid request 

with advertisers11: 

▪  URL of the visited site 
▪  Category or subject of the site 

▪  Operating system of the device 
▪  Browser software and version 
▪  Manufacturer and model of the device 

▪  Mobile operator 
▪  Screen dimensions 

▪  Unique user identification set by vendor and/or buyer. 
▪  Unique  person  identifier  from  the  Ad  Exchange,  often  derived  from  the  Ad  Exchange's 

cookie. 

▪  The  user  identification  of  a  DSP,  often  derived  from  the  Ad  Exchange's  cookie  that  is 

synchronised with a cookie from the DSP's domain. 

▪  Year of birth 

▪  Gender 

▪ 

Interests 

▪  Metadata reporting on consent given 

▪  Geography 

▪ 

Longitude and latitude 

▪  Post code 

30.  As a result, it is beyond doubt that the GDPR applies ratione materiae to the RTB system, of 

which the OpenRTB protocol and, to some extent, the Transparency & Consent Framework 

(TCF)  discussed  below  are  essential  components,  as  RTB  operations  by  means  of  bid 

requests inherently entail the processing of personal data. 

31.  The different steps and interactions between the SSPs, DSPs and DMPs that take place in 

the RTB system can be summarised as follows12:

An end user requests a web page; 

The publisher's ad server on the web page selects an SSP; 

The SSP then selects an Ad exchange; 

The Ad Exchange sends bid requests to hundreds of network partners and offers 

them the opportunity to generate a bid response; 

The Ad Exchange allows privileged DMPs and/or DSPs to synchronise http cookies; 

The Ad exchange places the winning bid;

The DSP serves the advertiser's ad; 

viii. 

The ad is loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network, or network provider); 

ix. 

The advertiser's server loads a Javascript for verification; 

32.  Real-time bidding poses a number of risks that stem from the nature of the ecosystem and 

the way personal data is processed within it. These risks include13: 

▪  profiling and automated decision-making;  

▪ 

▪ 

large-scale processing (including special categories of personal data);  

innovative use or application of new technological or organisational solutions;  

▪  matching or merging of datasets;  

▪  analysis or prediction of behaviour, location or movements of natural persons; 

▪ 

invisible processing of personal data.

33. 

In addition, a large number of organisations — such as data controllers, joint data controllers, 

processors  or  other  data  subjects  —  are  part  of  the  ecosystem.  This  has  a  potentially 

significant  impact  on  data  protection.  Moreover,  most  data  subjects  have  a  limited 

understanding of how the ecosystem processes their personal data.  

34.  As a result, the GDPR applies to the processing operations carried out within the framework 

of RTB, which are of such a nature that they can create a significant risk to the rights and 

freedoms of individuals. 

A.3.2. - IAB Europe's Transparency & Consent Framework 

35. 

IAB  Tech  Lab  has  developed  the  OpenRTB  protocol,  which  together  with  Google's 

AdBuyers protocol, is the most widely used RTB protocol worldwide. IAB Tech Lab, based 

in New York in the United States of America, acts as a provider of the OpenRTB standard 

and  should  be  distinguished  from  IAB  Europe,  which  developed  the  Transparency  and 

Consent Framework (TCF). 

36. 

IAB Europe is a federation representing the digital advertisement and marketing industry 

on the European level. It comprises corporate members as well as national associations, 

with their own corporate members. Indirectly, IAB Europe represents approximately 5.000 

companies, including both large corporations and national members14.  

37.  According  to  IAB  Europe,  the  defendant  in  these  proceedings,  the  TCF  provides 

accountability  and  transparency  to  the OpenRTB. The TCF  constitutes a separate set of 

policies, technical specifications, terms and conditions, created, managed and administered 

by IAB Europe, and, according to the defendant, should be capable of informing users of the 

legitimate interests pursued by advertisers, as well as obtaining the valid consent of those 

users  with  regard  to  the  processing  of  their  personal  data  in  a  real-time  bidding  system 

(such as OpenRTB). 

38.  Although  the  OpenRTB  should  be  distinguished  from  the  TCF,  the  two  systems  are 

connected. After all, IAB Europe claims that the TCF provides an operational framework in 

which the data processing operations that take place on the basis of the OpenRTB protocol 

can be brought in line with the GDPR (and the ePrivacy Directive).  

39. 

In relation to the TCF, IAB Europe states the following:  

“In its current form, the TCF is a cross-industry best practice standard that facilitates the 

digital advertising industry’s compliance with certain EU privacy and data protection rules 

and seeks to bring improved transparency and control to individuals over their personal data. 
Specifically, it is a “framework” within which businesses operate independently and which 

 

 

14 As indicated by the CEO of the defendant during the hearing before the Litigation Chamber, on 11 June 2021.  

12 

helps them satisfy the requirement to have a GDPR legal basis for any processing of personal 

data and the requirement for user consent for the storing and accessing of information on a 
user device under the ePrivacy Directive.”15 

40.  Moreover,  the  main  players  within  the  TCF  correspond  to  a  large  extent  to  the  parties 

participating in the OpenRTB (with the exception of the Consent Management Platforms, 

i.e. ‘CMPs’): 

i. 

Publishers— Parties who make advertising space available on their website or in 

their application and who are in direct contact with users whose personal data are 

collected and processed. A publisher may provide a CMP (see below) on its website 

or in its app to enable it to seek and manage the consent of visitors/users to the 

processing of their personal data and to facilitate the operation of TCF16. Publishers 

decide which adtech vendors may collect data through their website and process 

their users' personal data (and/or access their devices) and for what purposes17. 

ii. 

Adtech vendors — Companies that receive personal data from publishers in order 

to  fill  advertising  spaces  on  publisher  websites  or  in  publisher  apps,  such  as 

advertisers, SSPs, DSPs, Ad Exchanges, and DMPs. 

iii. 

Consent Management Platforms— Specifically for TCF, there are also companies 

that offer so-called "Consent Management Platforms" (CMPs). Specifically, a CMP 

takes the form of a pop-up that appears during the first connection to a website to 

collect  the  Internet  user's  consent  to  the  placement  of  cookies  and  other 

identifying information18.  

41.  An  essential  part  of  the  intervention  of  a  CMP  is  the  generation  of  a  character  string 

consisting of a combination of letters, numbers and other characters. This string is called 

the "TC String" by IAB Europe, which stands for the "Transparency and Consent String". The 

TC String is meant to capture in a structured and automated way the preferences of a user 

when he visits a website or app of a publisher that has integrated the CMP. This concerns in 

particular the capturing of consent (or not) to the processing of personal data for marketing 

and  other  purposes,  whether  or  not  to  share  personal  data  with  third  parties  (adtech 

vendors) and the exercise or not of the right to object. 

42.  Vendors decipher the TC String to determine whether they have the necessary legal basis 

to  process  a  user's  personal  data  for  the  specified  purposes. Thanks  to  its concise  data

format, the CMP can store and retrieve a user's preferred data at any time and pass this 

information on to adtech vendors who need it19. 

43.  This can be represented schematically as follows20: 

 

i. 

ii. 

An Internet user browses the website of a publisher, for example a news website. 

The publisher ensures that a CMP is activated on its website or in its app when the 

user arrives. 

iii. 

The CMP checks whether a TC String already exists for this user or not. If a "globally 

stored"  TC  String21  is  chosen,  the  CMP  will  contact  the  IAB  Europe-managed 

consensu.org internet domain to verify from there whether there is already a so-

called  "consensu"  cookie  on  the  user's  device.  In  particular,  this  relates  to  the 

euconsent-v2 cookie. 

iv. 

If the third step shows that the TC String does not yet exist or is not up to date, in a 

fourth step the CMP will show the user a user interface where he can consent to 

v. 

vi. 

the collection and sharing of his personal data.  

The Internet user makes a choice in the user interface. 

The CMP generates the TC String and places a euconsent-v2 cookie on the user's 

device or updates the existing cookie.

A.4. - Reports of the Inspection Service 

A.4.1  -  IAB  Europe  acts  as  data  controller  in  respect  of  the  Transparency  and  Consent 
Framework and the personal data processing operations relating thereto 

44. 

In these proceedings, the Inspection Service focused its investigation exclusively on IAB 

Europe,  which  the  Inspection  Service  identified  as  the  data  controller  for  the  TCF.  The 

Inspection Service supports this initial finding with the fact that IAB Europe developed the 

TCF, with which IAB Europe imposes binding rules on participating organisations. According 

to  the  Inspection  Service,  these  binding  rules  relate  in  particular  to  the  processing  of 

personal  data  in  the  context  of  the  collection  and  processing  of  consent,  as  well  as  the 

preferences of online users, regarding processing purposes and authorised adtech vendors. 

45.  The  Inspection  Service  bases  its  report  on  two  technical  analyses  related  to  the  Open 

Realtime  Bidding  API  Specification  of  IAB  Europe,  as  well  as  the  different  mechanisms 

under  the  OpenMedia  specification  of  IAB  Tech  Lab,  including  the  Transparency  and 

Consent Framework developed by IAB Europe jointly with IAB Tech Lab22. 

46.  With regard to the OpenRTB protocol, the Inspection Service concludes that IAB Tech Lab, 

which developed this open technical standard and is based in New York (USA), merely acts 

as a provider of the system with respect to participating organisations and therefore cannot 

be considered a data controller. In contrast to the TCF, the OpenRTB allows the processing 

of  personal  data  in  accordance  with  means  and  purposes  entirely  determined  by  the 

participating organisations, but not by IAB Tech Lab. 

47.  Finally,  the  Inspection  Service  states  that  the  Belgian  DPA  is  not  competent  for  the 

Authorised  Buyers  protocol,  which  was  developed  by  Google  as  an  alternative  to  the 

OpenRTB standard.  

A.4.2. - Identified infringements of the GDPR 

48.  The Inspection Service finds that IAB Europe is in breach of the following legal provisions 

and principles of the GDPR with its Transparency and Consent Framework: 

▪  Articles 5.1.a and 5.2 (principles of fairness, transparency and accountability)  

▪  Article 6.1 (lawfulness of processing);  

▪  Article 9.1 and 9.2 (processing of special categories of personal data); 

▪  Article  12.1  (transparency  of  information,  communications  and  modalities  for 

exercising data subjects' rights);  

 

 

22 Technical Analysis Reports of the Inspection Service, 4 June 2019 (Exhibit 24) and 6 January 2020 (Exhibit 53). Whereas 
IAB Europe drafted the TCF Policies, IAB Tech Lab developed the technical specifications in accordance with said Policies.  

15 

▪  Article 13 (information to be provided when personal data have been obtained from 

the data subject);  

▪  Article 14 (information to be provided when personal data have not been obtained 

from the data subject); 

▪  Article 24.1 (responsibility of the data controller);  

▪  Articles 32.1 and 32.2 (security of processing). 

49.  Outside  the  scope  of  the  complaints,  the  Inspection  Service  also  finds  additional 

infringements of the following provisions of the GDPR: 

▪  Article 30 (register of processing activities); 

▪  Article 31 (cooperation with the supervisory authorities); 

▪  Article 24.1 (responsibility of the data controller); 

▪  Article 37 (appointment of a data protection officer. 

Finding 1 - IAB Europe wrongly uses legitimate interest as a basis for processing personal data 

under the TCF, whereby special categories of personal data may also be processed in certain 

cases. 

50.  Based  on  the  two  versions  of  the  IAB  Europe  Transparency  &  Consent  Framework 

Policies23,  the  Inspection  Service  notes  that  IAB  Europe  places  the  responsibility  for 

compliance with the principles of transparency and fairness on the CMPs and/or publishers. 

Moreover,  IAB  Europe  takes  the  position  that  the  legitimate  interest  of  participating 

organisations is an appropriate basis for processing personal data within the framework of 

the  TCF  in  order  to  create  an  advertising  profile  of  the  data  subjects  and  to  display 

personalised advertising to them. However, according to the Inspection Service, IAB Europe 

fails  to  provide  evidence  that  the  interests,  in  particular  the  fundamental  rights  and 

freedoms, of data subjects were adequately considered in the process. 

51. 

Incidentally, the Inspection Service notes that in certain circumstances, special categories 

of personal data may also be collected and processed by the participating organisations. 

For example, participating organisations could learn about the websites previously visited 

by  a  data  subject,  whereby  the  political  opinions,  religious  or  philosophical  convictions, 

sexual orientation, health data or even trade union memberships of the data subjects could 

be inferred or revealed. 

52.  The Inspection Service considers that IAB Europe has thus failed to comply adequately with 

the principles of transparency and fairness in relation to the persons concerned. 

 

 

23  IAB  Europe  Transparency  &  Consent  Framework  Policies  v2019-08-21.3  (Exhibit  32);  IAB  Europe  Transparency  & 
Consent Framework Policies v2019-04-02.2c (Exhibit 38). 

16 

Finding 2 - The information provided does not comply with Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR 

53.  The Inspection Service also finds that the privacy policy that IAB Europe makes available to 

data subjects is not always transparent or understandable, which constitutes a breach of 

the obligations arising from Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR. 

54.  The privacy policy of IAB Europe24 is available only in English. In addition, the privacy policy 

contains several terms that, without further explanation, are unclear to those involved. By 

way of example, the Inspection Service mentions "services" and "other means". 

55.  Moreover, according to the Inspection Service, the information provided is incomplete and 

inadequate. Firstly, data subjects are not informed of the exact legitimate interests pursued 

by IAB Europe. Secondly, it is not easy for data subjects to distinguish between the different 

recipients or categories of recipients of their personal data; the terms "third parties" and 

"partners" are not understandable without further explanation. Thirdly, data subjects are 

not informed, on the one hand, about the reference to appropriate or sufficient safeguards 

for the international transfer of their personal data outside the EEA or, on the other hand, 

about how to obtain a copy or where it is made available. Fourthly, based on the privacy 

policy of IAB Europe, it is not clear to data subjects that their personal data can be obtained 

by IAB Europe via its TCF25. Fifthly, the conditions under which data subjects must provide 

their personal data, in particular whether this collection is organised on the basis of a legal, 

pre-contractual or contractual obligation, are not clearly set out. Nor are the data subjects 

informed of the possible consequences of not providing their data. 

56.  Therefore, the privacy policy does not comply with the obligations enshrined in Articles 13 

and 14 of the GDPR.  

Finding 3 - IAB Europe does not foresee any compliance control under the TCF policy rules 

57.  On the basis of the two versions of the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework 

Policies26,  the  Inspection  Service  is  of  the  opinion  that  IAB  Europe  does  not  sufficiently 

monitor  compliance  with  the  rules 

it  has  developed  with  regard  to  participating 

organisations. In particular, it would be possible for a CMP to continue exchanging personal 

data with a publisher even if it reasonably considers that this Publisher does not comply with 

the  rules  imposed  by  IAB  Europe  in  the  context  of  its  TCF  or  the  rules  imposed  by  the 

legislation27.

58.  Given the role that IAB Europe assigns to itself, namely that of Managing Organisation, this 

disregard for the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects would indicate a breach 

of  Article  24.1  GDPR  as  well  as  of  the  obligation  to  provide  appropriate  security  for  the 

processing of personal data, pursuant to Articles 32.1 and 32.2 GDPR. 

Finding 4 - IAB Europe failed to keep a register of processing operations 

59.  The Inspection Service also notes that IAB Europe does not consider itself obliged to keep 

a register of processing activities, based on the exception provided in Article 30.5 GDPR for 

organisations with fewer than 250 persons28. The Inspection Service also points out that 

IAB  Europe  did  not  initially  provide  a  copy  of  its  register  of  processing  activities  to  the 

Inspection Service. 

60.  Only in a second reply29 did IAB Europe decide, for the sake of completeness, to provide a 

register  of  processing  activities,  although  the  organisation  still  does  not  consider  itself 

subject to the obligation under Article 30.5 GDPR.  

Finding 5 - IAB Europe did not cooperate sufficiently with the investigation by the Inspection 

Service 

61.  Based on finding 4, and with reference to the delay with which IAB Europe responded to the 

Inspection Service's requests for additional information, the Inspection Service concludes 

that the conduct of IAB Europe in the context of its investigation is in breach of the duty to 

cooperate under Article 31 of the GDPR.   

Finding  6  -  IAB  Europe  failed  to  appoint  a  data  protection  officer,  although  as  Managing 

Organisation it reserves the right to access the (personal) data that organisations participating 

in the TCF collect and process 

62. 

IAB Europe asserts30 that it does not fulfil the conditions referred to in Article 37.1.b of the 

GDPR,  as "IAB Europe is a professional  association whose main  activities  are to  provide 

information  and  tools  to  stakeholders  (in  particular,  companies)  operating  in  the  digital 

advertising sector, as well as to provide information to the general public in order to improve 

their  knowledge  and  to  inform  them  of  the  value  that  digital  advertising  brings  to  the 

market". For these reasons, IAB Europe has not appointed a data protection officer. 

63.  According  to  the  Inspection  Service,  the  approach  of  IAB  Europe  set  out  above  is  not 

supported  by  the  facts.  IAB  Europe  developed  and  manages  the  TCF  in  its  capacity  as 

Managing Organisation and as such, as well as under the terms and conditions of the IAB

Europe  Transparency  &  Consent  Framework31,  has  a  right  to  access  and  to  store  and 

process all information provided by participating organisations.  

A.4.3.  -  Additional  considerations  that  the  Inspection  Service  considers  relevant  to  the 

assessment of the gravity of the facts 

64.  The Inspection Service refers to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union 

(hereinafter "the Court of Justice") in Case C-25/17 (Jehovah's Witnesses)32, in which the 

Court clarified that the definition of data controller must be interpreted broadly in order to 

ensure effective and complete protection of data subjects. In this regard, the  Inspection 

Service argues that IAB Europe is trying to evade its responsibility under the GDPR. 

65.  The Inspection Service refers to clauses included under Title 10 "Liability" of the General 

Terms and Conditions for the TCF33, with which IAB Europe places the responsibility for the 

processing of personal data collected by the parties of the digital advertising sector entirely 

on the CMPs, publishers and other adtech vendors34.  Indeed, these clauses expressly state 

that IAB Europe does not guarantee in any way that: 

▪ 

the  consent  given  by  CMPs  or  publishers  to  authorised  partners  (global  adtech 

vendors) has been collected and processed in accordance with, inter alia, the GDPR; 

▪  any data processing carried out in connection with, or on account of, the TCF shall 

comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including the GDPR. 

 

A.5. - Summary of the defendant's response dd. 11 February 2021 

A.5.1. - IAB Europe is not a data controller with regard to the processing of personal data in 

connection with the TCF 

66.  The defendant refutes the Inspection Service's view that it acts, in its capacity as Managing 

Organisation, as a data controller in respect of the personal data processed by participants 

in the Transparency and Consent Framework.  

67.  According to the defendant, the TCF in no way obliges the participating organisations to 

pursue  certain  objectives,  but  merely  aims  to  provide  the  information,  which  must  be 

provided  to  data  subjects  in  accordance  with  Articles  12  and  13  of  the  GDPR,  in  a

streamlined  and  standardised  manner  by  means  of  the  CMPs.  In  contrast,  the  actual 

processing  purposes  are  determined  by  the  participating  organisations,  without  the 

intervention of the defendant. 

68.  Firstly, the defendant addresses the lack of legal capacity (ratione personae) on the part of 

the DPA, and more specifically the Inspection Service, to conduct an investigation and to 

challenge the TCF. The defendant also refers to the DPA's capacity to hold the actual data 

controllers, i.e. the participants in the TCF, accountable for possible infringements of the 

GDPR, where necessary.  

69.  According to the defendant, the TCF as such does not entail any processing  of personal 

data and the Inspection Report does not show for which processing activities IAB Europe 

should be regarded as the data controller. 

70.  Secondly, it argues that a broad definition of the concept of a data controller, as proposed 

by the Inspection Service, is not justified in the context of the TCF, since there are already 

clearly identified data controllers, on the one hand, and in view of the fact that the TCF has 

no  influence  on  the  processing  of  personal  data  that  takes  place  in  the  context  of  the 

OpenRTB protocol, on the other. More specifically, the defendant refers to the lack of any 

influence on both the means and ends of processing within the RTB system.  

71.  The defendant also considers that the Jehovah's Witnesses judgment cited above does not 

apply to the situation of IAB Europe, for the following reasons: 

▪  Unlike  the  Jehovah's  Witness  Community,  IAB  Europe  does  not  "organise, 

coordinate  or  promote"  in  any  way  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  TCF 

participants. 

▪  The processing of personal data by TCF participants for RTB purposes is not in the 

interest of IAB Europe. 

▪  TCF participants have no common purpose in processing personal data and only 

participate  in  the  TCF  with  the  aim  of  achieving  their  individual  objectives  in  a 

manner that is compliant with the GDPR. 

72.  The defendant is of the opinion that the Wirtschaftsakademie35 ruling does not apply to IAB 

Europe either, as the defendant never disseminates information (i.e. advertising) on behalf 

of  or  at  the  behest  of  advertisers;  does  not  choose  an  advertising  platform  or  other 

communication channel; and does not set any parameters or processing purposes, unlike 

the participants in the TCF who do decide on these matters. According to the  defendant, 

IAB  Europe  is  not  actively  involved  in  any  RTB  processing  and  it  does  not  initiate  such 

 

 

35 CJEU judgment of 5 June 2018, C-210/16, Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein, ECLI:EU:C:2018:388. 

20 

processing in any way or form. The data processing associated with the OpenRTB system 

is carried out exclusively by TCF participants and therefore takes place independently of 

IAB Europe or the TCF. 

73.  Thirdly, it discusses the definition of a data controller as explained in guidelines issued by 

the  European  Data  Protection  Board  (EDPB).36  The  defendant  claims  that  it  does  not 

exercise  any  discretion  as  to  the  purposes  or  means  of  the  processing  of  personal  data 

within the framework of the TCF. Furthermore, IAB Europe does not process personal data 

in  a  way  that  could  be  regarded  as  "inseparable"  from,  or  "inextricably  linked"  to,  the 

processing  of  personal  data  by  participants  in  the  TCF.  Also,  the  fact  that  participating 

organisations  pay  a  financial  fee  to  IAB  Europe  does  not  constitute,  according  to  the 

defendant, a "mutual benefit" that would lead to a joint processing responsibility.  

74.  Moreover,  the  defendant  emphasises  the  lack  of  decisions  or  guidelines  from  other 

supervisory authorities which could support the Inspection Service's view. In particular, the 

Belgian, German, French and UK supervisory authorities failed to identify IAB Europe as a 

(joint)  data  controller.  Specifically,  the  Conference  of  Independent  Data  Protection 

Authorities of the German Federation and the Länder decided in September 2019 that IAB 

Europe was acting purely as a representative organisation in the sector of programmatic 

advertising.  In  addition,  the  German  supervisory  authorities  confirmed  their  position  in 

November  2019,  when  they  announced  that  any  enforcement  proceedings  related  to 

complaints against online advertising should be initiated against TCF participants, but not 

against IAB Europe. According to the defendant, the French supervisory authority (CNIL) 

also indirectly accepted the view that IAB Europe was not responsible for the processing 

operations  carried  out  by  participants  in  the  TCF.  Also,  the  UK  ICO  has  allegedly  never 

identified IAB Europe as a potential data controller within the RTB ecosystem at any point.  

75.  Finally, the defendant refers to the possible consequences for other organisations subject 

to  the  GDPR  if  the  Litigation  Chamber  were  to  rule  that  IAB  Europe  is  indeed  (co-

)responsible  for  the  processing  of  personal  data  within  the  framework  of  the  TCF.  In 

particular,  according  to  the  defendant,  such  a  decision  would  mean  that  any  umbrella 

organisation which develops and adopts a code of conduct would, merely by virtue of its 

supervisory role, be deemed to be co-responsible with regard to the processing operations 

carried out by other organisations in accordance with that code of conduct. 

 

 

36 EDPB - Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of data controller and processor in the GDPR, v2.0, 2021. 

21 

A.5.2. - The TCF complies with the GDPR 

a. Legality and legal basis 

76.  First of all, the defendant argues that IAB Europe, unlike the participating organisations, is 

not at all obliged to explain to the Inspection Service the existence of a legitimate interest, 

including a balancing of the interests of participating organisations against the rights and 

freedoms of data subjects, since IAB Europe does not participate in the TCF nor does it act 

as a data controller.  

77.  Moreover, the defendant claims that the DPA is not authorised to prohibit participants in 

the TCF from processing personal data of data subjects on the basis of a legitimate interest. 

On the contrary, the assessment of the merits of the legitimate interests asserted by the 

participants must be made on a case-by-case basis, and therefore cannot be prohibited in 

advance and in absolute terms by the DPA. 

78.  As regards the allegations that IAB Europe processes special categories of personal data 

within the framework of the TCF, or is allegedly jointly responsible for the processing of 

such personal data by the participating organisations, the defendant points out that such 

categories of personal data may, if necessary, only be processed within the framework of 

the  OpenRTB,  as  opposed  to  the  TCF.  The  defendant  refers  in  this  regard  to  the  TCF 

Policies,  which  expressly  prohibit  the  use  of  the  TCF  to  process  special  categories  of 

personal data. 

b. Transparency 

79. 

In view of the fact that IAB Europe does not act as a data controller in respect of personal 

data  processed  for  RTB  purposes,  the  defendant  argues  that  it  cannot  be  expected  to 

inform data subjects in accordance with Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR either. 

80.  Moreover,  the  defendant  claims  that  the  privacy  policy  which  the  Inspection  Service 

invokes as evidence of possible infringements of the principle of transparency is applicable 

exclusively to the processing of personal data collected on the various websites operated 

by  the  defendant,  as  well  as  to  the  personal  data  collected  in  connection  with  the 

participating  organisations  (in  particular,  the  contact  details  of  representatives  of  those 

organisations). In other words, the privacy policy to which the Inspection Service refers has 

no connection whatsoever, according to the defendant, with the processing activities in the 

context of the OpenRTB system. 

81.  The defendant  also disputes any  allegation that IAB Europe,  in its capacity  as Managing 

Organisation, reserves the right to access the personal data collected and exchanged by 

the participating organisations within the framework of the TCF and the OpenRTB system. 

IAB  Europe  claims  that  this  assumption  is  not  based  on  any  evidence  and  is  due  to  an 

22 

incorrect interpretation of the possibility offered to the defendant to process personal data 

of representatives of participating organisations.  

82.  Moreover, the defendant considers that it is entitled to offer the privacy policy exclusively 

in  English,  since  the  target  audience  is  mainly  professional,  B2B  actors.  The  defendant 

points  out  that  Belgian  law  does  not  provide  for  any  obligation  to  make  a  privacy  policy 

available  in  French  or  Dutch  and  that,  moreover,  Belgium  has  failed  to  make  use  of  the 

possibility of adopting additional requirements concerning the use of language within the 

framework of the European Directive on consumer rights37. 

c. Security 

83.  The defendant claims that the charges concerning the lack of technical and organisational 

measures to protect personal data in connection with the TCF are unfounded.  

84.  First of all, the defendant takes the view that IAB Europe is not subject to Articles 24 and 

32 of the GDPR in respect of the data processing operations carried out within the TCF, as 

the organisation is not a data controller. 

85.  Secondly, the Transparency & Consent Framework Policies provide that participants in the 

TCF must report infringements of TCF rules to  IAB Europe.  Again, the defendant claims 

that  the  Inspection  Service  is  misinterpreting  the  TCF  Policies,  in  particular  by  granting 

CMPs  the  right  to  terminate  the  cooperation  if  they  consider  that  a  publisher  does  not 

comply  with  the  rules,  without  suffering  any  contractual  disadvantage.  In  addition,  the 

defendant  notes  that  infringements  of  the  rules  provided  for  in  the  TCF  can  always  be 

reported  to  the  supervisory  authorities,  which  will  then  take  action  if  they  deem  it 

necessary.  

d. International transfer of personal data 

86. 

IAB Europe refutes the complainants' allegations concerning the international transfer of 

personal  data within  the  framework of the TCF. The  defendant  notes in this regard that 

these allegations are only relevant in the context of the OpenRTB system, which is not at 

issue in this case. Incidentally, IAB Europe cannot be held responsible for the transfer within 

the framework of the OpenRTB System.  

A.5.3. - IAB Europe is not subject to the obligation to keep a register of processing operations 

87.  The defendant emphasises that it can invoke the exception provided for in Article 30.5, in 

particular that the organisation does not have to keep a register of processing activities, as 

 

 

37 Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, amending 
Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council 
Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 304/64. 

23 

IAB Europe is not a data controller in respect of the processing activities carried out within 

the TCF and, moreover, the organisation has fewer than 250 employees. Nevertheless, the 

defendant emphasises its own initiative in drawing  up a register and submitting it to  the 

Inspection  Service,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  this  register  does  not  relate  to  processing 

activities relating to the TCF. 

A.5.4. - IAB Europe is not required to appoint a data protection officer 

88.  Having  regard  to  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  processing  activities  carried  out  by  the 

organisation,  the  defendant  states  that  IAB  Europe  is  not  required  to  appoint  a  data 

protection officer, since the criteria laid down in Article 37 of the GDPR are not met.  

A.5.5. - IAB Europe did cooperate with the Inspection Service 

89.  The  defendant  refutes  the  allegations  of  insufficient  cooperation  with  the  investigation, 

noting that the time limits imposed by the Inspection Service on parties to an investigation 

are in no way determined by law, but must be the result of reasonable assessment and must 

take into account the specific circumstances of the case. In the present case, the defendant 

takes  the  view  that  IAB  Europe  has  always  cooperated  in  good  faith  and  provided 

information  and  replies  in  an  attempt  to  clarify  its  status  in  relation  to  the  TCF  and  to 

demonstrate its compliance with the GDPR, in so far as it applies to IAB Europe. 

90. 

In  addition, the  defendant  observes that the duty  of cooperation  under Article 31  of the 

GDPR  cannot  in  any  way  be  construed  as  an  obligation  to  provide  documentation  in 

accordance  with  provisions  of  the  GDPR  which  the  defendant  does  not  consider  to  be 

required.  

A.5.6. - There are no aggravating circumstances to the detriment of IAB Europe 

91. 

Finally, IAB Europe disputes the Inspection Service's finding that the defendant's denial that 

IAB Europe is acting as a data controller, as well as the large volume of both personal data 

processed  and  of  participating  organisations,  may  be  regarded  as  aggravating 

circumstances.  

92.  The defendant  refers to  the lack  of clear  evidence  in the investigation report that these 

circumstances are aggravating and concludes that the allegations are due to insufficient 

knowledge  of  the  operation  of  the  TCF.  Consequently,  the  defendant  requests  the 

Litigation Chamber to disregard the opinion of the Inspection Service.

A.6. - Summary of the complainants' reply submissions dd. 18 February 2021 

A.6.1. – IAB Europe is data controller for the TCF  

a. Processing of personal data within the framework of the TCF 

93.  The  complainants  argue  that  a  unique  identification  number,  such  as  the  TC  String 

generated and stored in a cookie, is personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the 

GDPR, a position which has also been expressly confirmed in case law prior to the GDPR. 

94.  Moreover, according to the complainants, the TC String is more than just a unique identifier, 

as  IAB  Europe  allegedly  also  uses  the  TC  String  to  collect  information  regarding  which 

applications  a  data  subject  uses  and  which  websites  he  visits.  This  could  also  reveal 

sensitive data on data subjects within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR. 

95.  Furthermore,  the  generation  of  the  TC  String  in  itself  constitutes,  without  any  doubt, 

processing  of  personal  data.  The  issue  at  hand  is  the  automated  creation,  by  a  CMP 

registered  with  the  TCF,  of  a  unique  and  linked  set  of  characters  intended  to  capture  a 

specific user's preferences regarding permitted data exchanges with advertisers.  

96.  The sharing of the TC String with CMPs takes place, according to the complainants, in two 

ways: 

a.  storing the TC String in a shared globally scoped consent cookie on the IAB Europe 

consensu.org internet domain; or 

b.  storing  the  TC  String  in  a  storage  system  chosen  by  the  CMP  if  it  is  a  service-

specific permission. 

97.  According  to  the  complainants,  in  both  cases  IAB  Europe  is  the  data  controller  of  those 

processing operations. The intervention of IAB Europe is, moreover, all the more drastic in 

the  hypothesis of the shared  global  consent  cookie. Indeed, that shared  globally  scoped 

consent cookie that stores the TC String points to the "consensu.org" domain, managed by 

IAB Europe, from where CMPs can access and update the shared TC String.  

b. IAB acts as data controller for the processing operations within the TCF 

98.  First of all, the complainants believe that IAB Europe, in its "Frequently Asked Questions" 

about the TCF, explicitly states that it is responsible for the TCF Policies. 

99.  According to the complainants, it goes without saying that the organisation that manages 

and operates the TCF is also the data controller of this system, including any processing of 

personal  data  imposed  and  organised  by  the  TCF.  After  all,  IAB  Europe  imposes  these 

personal data processing operations on the other participants in an enforceable manner. 

100.  Furthermore,  IAB  Europe  requires  CMPs  to  implement  the  TCF  strictly  according  to  its 

Technical Specifications. In the TCF Technical Specifications, IAB Europe explains in detail 

25 

which personal data must be processed by the participants, for what purposes and by what 

means. 

101. 

IAB Europe also requires CMPs, in the case of a global consent, to store the character string 

in a shared global consent cookie on the "consensu.org" domain. Since this internet domain 

is registered and managed by IAB Europe, the defendant also has access to the personal 

data processed in the TCF. 

102.  Moreover, according to the complainants, IAB Europe determines the so-called "essential 

means" for the processing of personal data within the TCF. On the one hand, IAB Europe 

specifies in detail which elements must be included in the TC String. And, on the other hand, 

IAB Europe determines the categories of recipients of that personal data, as the defendant 

is  responsible,  in  its  own  words,  for  the  management  of  the  Global  Vendor  List  and  the 

management of the CMPs participating in the TCF. 

103.  The  complainants  also  believe  that  TCF  does  not  provide  an  effective  mechanism  to 

enforce certain policies38, although a code of conduct is intended to be an effective system 

for compelling its members to comply, as stipulated in Article 41 GDPR. 

A.6.2. - The processing operations carried out in the TCF violate the GDPR at various levels 

a. Infringement of the principles of purpose, proportionality and necessity 

104.  According to the complainants, IAB Europe collects users' preferences in the TCF via the 

TC String for a vague, inaccessible and abusive purpose, while the personal data processed 

is insufficient and irrelevant for this purpose.  

105.  Moreover, the processing in itself is alleged to be anything but proportionate, which means 

that IAB Europe is in breach of Articles 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, as well as its duty of 

responsibility as the data controller, laid down in Article 5(2) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the 

complainants consider that, with the design of the TCF, IAB Europe does not provide the 

necessary  guarantees  for  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  GDPR  and  for  the 

protection of the rights of data subjects; consequently, the defendant infringes Article 25 

GDPR. 

The  purpose  of  processing  the  TC  String  is  neither  specified  nor  explicitly  defined  for  data 

subjects, nor is it justified 

106.  According to the complainants, IAB Europe does not provide information to data subjects 

concerning the processing of their personal data in the TCF. 

 

 

38 See para. 133 et seq. of this decision. 

26 

107.  The  purpose  of  the  TC  String  within  the  overall  purpose  of  the  TCF  is  to  capture  the 

information provided to users and their processing preferences. In other words, IAB Europe 

does process personal data (in particular the TC String) within the TCF because it claims this 

could bring the underlying marketing-related processing in line with the GDPR. According 

to  the  complainants,  it  is  therefore  this  purpose  that  must  be  assessed  in  terms  of  its 

lawfulness,  and  in  the  light  of  this  purpose,  the  proportionality  and  necessity  of  the  TC 

String's processing within the TCF must be assessed. 

The TC String is inadequate and not relevant for the intended purpose 

108.  The complainants further argue that the TC String's processing operations within the TCF 

are insufficient and not relevant to ensure compliance with the GDPR when personal data 

are processed through the OpenRTB system. 

109.  The OpenRTB system contains an inherent security problem that makes it impossible for a 

system such as the TCF to guarantee, among other things, the necessary transparency and 

accountability with regard to personal data, including special categories of personal data, 

processed in a bid request after the bid request has been sent out. 

110.  The central idea behind the TCF is that participants collect user preferences and transmit 

them in the form of the TC String, so that other participants take note of the content (i.e. 

read the TCF signal) and can therefore respect the user preferences. However, according 

to the complainants, there is nothing in the TCF, or in any related system or mechanism, that 

actually ensures that participants in the OpenRTB system are bound by the TCF signal. The 

TCF signal is therefore no more than a mere notification. 

111.  Given the inherently unlawful nature of processing personal data in the OpenRTB system, 

on the one hand, and the inherently imperfect nature of a purely signal-based system such 

as  the  TCF  without  effective  control,  on  the  other,  the  use  of  the  TCF,  including  the 

processing  of  the  TC  String,  can  never  give  participants  the  assurance  of  being  in 

compliance  with  the  GDPR.  After  all,  the  TCF  offers  no  guarantee  whatsoever  that  TCF 

participants will comply with their accountability obligations (Article 5.2 of the GDPR). Nor 

can  it  provide  adequate  protection  for  the  personal  data  shared  through  the  OpenRTB 

system (Article 5.1.f GDPR). 

IAB Europe set up the TCF in such a way that data protection by design is not guaranteed 

112.  The  complainants  argue  that  the  design  of  the  TCF,  due  to  its  disproportionate  nature, 

cannot guarantee the level of data protection required under Article 25 GDPR, in particular 

in view of the obligation arising from Article 25 GDPR to implement appropriate technical 

and  organisational  measures  to  ensure  that,  in  principle,  only  personal  data  that  are 

necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. 

27 

113.  The processing of personal data within the TCF, in particular the TC String, is therefore not 

necessary for the specific purpose as, according to the complainants, that purpose cannot 

and will not be achieved in any case.  

114.  Moreover, the complainants argue that the TC String, as an independent personal data that 

uniquely 

identifies  users, 

is  shared  with  numerous  participants  through  various 

mechanisms, including through IAB Europe's own mechanism of the shared global consent 

cookie on its "consensu.org" internet domain.  

b. Infringement of the principles of fair, lawful and transparent processing (Articles 5, 6, 12, 13 

and 14 GDPR) 

115.  The complainants allege that data subjects are not informed in any way of the fact that their 

personal  data  (including  the  TC  String)  are  systematically  and  widely  processed  by  IAB 

Europe within the TCF.  

116.  According to the complainants, the processing of the personal data of the complainants and 

other data subjects by IAB in the TCF is after all: 

▪  anything but lawful as there is no legal basis; 

▪  neither proper nor transparent, as it takes place entirely "behind the backs" of those 

affected, without any form of notification. 

IAB Europe's processing operations lack a legal basis and are therefore unlawful 

117. 

IAB Europe cannot rely on the consent of data subjects (Article 6.1.a GDPR), according to 

the complainants, as it never sought or obtained such consent. Also nowhere in the TCF 

Policies, Technical Specifications or General Terms and Conditions is a mechanism cited 

whereby  IAB  Europe  would  ask  data  subjects  for  permission  to  generate  a  unique 

identifying  string  of  characters  that  shares  their  privacy  preferences  with  a  mass  of 

recipients, even in cases where those data subjects indicate in a CMP that they do not wish 

to share personal data with anyone. 

118.  According  to  the  complainants,  IAB  Europe  also  cannot  invoke  the  necessity  of  the 

processing  of  the  TC  String  within  the  TCF  for  the  performance  of  a  contract  with  the 

complainants and other data subjects (Article 6.1.b), as there is no contract between data 

subjects and IAB Europe. 

119.  Furthermore, the complainants argue that the defendant may also not rely on the necessity 

of the processing of the TC String within the TCF to serve its legitimate interests, or those 

of a third party (Article 6.1.f GDPR). The required balancing of interests would always be in 

favour of those affected. 

120.  First of all, the processing of the TC String does not benefit the data subjects in any way as 

the TCF is not able to guarantee security, accountability or transparency. Moreover, there 

28 

is no legitimate interest, as this interest is not sufficiently clearly articulated anywhere, and 

it  is  not  possible  to  balance  it  against  the  interests  and  fundamental  rights  of  the  data 

subjects. 

121.  Secondly, in balancing the interests, the data controller must in principle take into account 

several factors: the effects of the processing on the data subject, the nature of the personal 

data  processed,  the  way  in  which  these  personal  data  are  processed,  the  data  subject's 

reasonable expectations, and the status of the data controller and the data subject. 

122.  According to the complainants, the consequences of the processing of the TC String are 

particularly far-reaching for those involved. IAB Europe's processing operations would lead 

TCF  participants  to  assume  that  they  are  correctly  informing  data  subjects  about  the 

processing  of personal  data through  the OpenRTB system,  but this is not  the case. This 

would then lead to  the unlawful sharing and distribution of personal data, even sensitive 

personal data, on an immense scale via the OpenRTB system.  

123. 

IAB Europe's processing of the TC String would result in a unique online identifier being 

shared with untold numbers of parties, similar to what happens with unique identifiers in 

advertising  cookies  from  large  advertising  companies.  It  would  therefore  allow  easy 

tracking  of  users  across  the  web  and  across  devices  ("web  and  cross-device  tracking"). 

Moreover,  the  complainants  argue  that  the  TC  String  can  be  combined  with  the  data 

distributed via the OpenRTB system, because the TC String is integrated in a bid request. 

124.  Given the lack of information for data subjects about the processing operations within the 

TCF  and  the  unrestricted  sharing  of  the  TC  String  with  an  almost  unlimited  group  of 

recipients, it is clear to the complainants that these processing operations are beyond the 

scope of the data subjects' reasonable expectations. Furthermore, data subjects such as 

the complainants do not expect that the processing of personal data within the TCF will 

result in their, sometimes sensitive, personal data and detailed profiles being shared with 

numerous companies through the OpenRTB system without any real and effective control 

over what those companies will do with the personal data obtained. 

125.  The complainants in this case are natural persons and interest groups representing the data 

protection  interests  of  natural  persons.  They  have  no  control  over  the  processing  of 

personal data within a TCF (which happens anyway, regardless of whether consent is given 

or refused in a CMP). Nor do they have control over what happens to their personal data 

shared  through  the  OpenRTB  system.  According  to  the  complainants,  those  involved 

cannot verify whether participants in OpenRTB actually comply with the rules of the TCF. 

29 

IAB Europe processes personal data in the TCF covertly without any form of notification and the 

processing is therefore neither proper nor transparent 

126.  Despite the extensive documentation that IAB Europe makes available to TCF participants 

on  its  website,  nowhere  does  it  state  that  the  TCF  itself  also  involves  the  processing  of 

personal  data,  according  to  the  complainants.  Moreover,  the  documentation  expressly 

disregards, with regard to TCF participants, that the TCF itself involves the processing of 

personal data. 

127.  The TCF Implementation Guidelines seems to suggest that there are hypotheses in which 

participation in a TCF does not involve the processing of personal data. After all, advertisers 

and DSPs, who already participate in the TCF, are told that they should register as vendors 

if they process personal data. According to the complainants, this implies that they would 

not have to do so if they were not processing personal data. However, the latter situation is 

entirely  impossible,  according  to  the  complainants,  as  the  TCF  inherently  requires  the 

processing of personal data. 

128.  According to the complainants, the statements in the IAB Europe guidelines are misleading 

for the hundreds of adtech vendors who use TCF. Because IAB Europe does not inform TCF 

participants  about  the  processing  of  personal  data  necessarily  entailed  by  the 

implementation  of  a  TCF,  none  of  these  participants  knows  or  realises  that  they  have  a 

transparency  obligation.  In  this  way,  data  subjects  -  such  as  the  complainants  -  are  not 

informed by any participant of the processing of personal data within TCF. 

129. 

IAB Europe does also not comply with its own transparency obligation. Neither on its own 

website nor in other sources does the defendant communicate the information required by 

Articles 13 and 14 to those concerned, such as the complainants. This would include the 

following  information:  that  IAB  Europe  is  the  data  controller  of  the  TCF  and  its  contact 

details; the contact details of its data protection officer; what its processing purposes are 

and the legal basis for the processing; which categories of personal data it processes (in 

particular  the  TC  String);  who  receives  the  personal  data  (these  are  already  at  least  all 

participants in the TCF who receive the TC String); that IAB Europe intends to transfer the 

personal data to recipients in third countries; how long the personal data are retained; what 

its legitimate interests for processing are; what the rights of the data subjects are; that data 

subjects may lodge a complaint with the DPA; that data subjects may withdraw their given 

consents; and finally, what the source of the personal data is. 

130.  At the same time, IAB Europe cannot invoke any of the exceptions provided for in Article 

14.5 of the GDPR in order not to have to provide this information, as: 

a.  the data subjects are not yet in possession of the information, since the processing 

in respect of them has so far been carried out in secret (Article 14.5.a GDPR); 

30 

b. 

it  is  not  impossible  nor  does  it  require  a  disproportionate  effort  to  make  this 

information  known  to  the  data  subjects,  given  the  influence  that  IAB  Europe 

exercises over the operation of the TCF (Article 14.5.b GDPR); 

c.  the acquisition of these data is not prescribed by law (Article 14.5.c of the GDPR); 

and 

d.  the personal data need not remain confidential for reasons of professional secrecy 

(Article 14.5.d GDPR). 

IAB Europe's reference to the Vectaury case in France does not hold water 

131.  According to the complainants, IAB Europe wrongly believes that it can rely on the decision 

of the French supervisory authority CNIL in the Vectaury case. Indeed, IAB Europe wrongly 

claims that it would be strange for the Inspection Service to find infringements related to 

the processing of personal data in the TCF, while the CNIL is alleged to have no problems 

with  the  legitimacy  of  these  processing  operations.  The  complainants  argue  that  IAB 

Europe is making assumptions here and reaching conclusions that cannot be deduced from 

the Vectaury case at all: 

•  Firstly,  the  Vectaury  case  was  about  the  specific  implementation  of  a  CMP  by 
Vectaury whereby the TCF would have been implemented. The role of IAB Europe 

was not the subject of those proceedings and CNIL therefore did not rule on, nor 

investigate, the role of IAB Europe in providing the TCF. 

•  Secondly, that case specifically concerned whether Vectaury's implementation of 

the TCF could bring the underlying processing of real-time bidding systems in line 

with  the  GDPR.  The  CNIL's  verdict  was  clearly  negative,  as  shown  by  the  fact 

Vectaury itself states on its website that it has created a completely new method in 

dialogue with the CNIL. According to the complainants, it is therefore misleading of 

IAB  Europe  to  claim  that  the  CNIL  has  legitimised  the  TCF  in  itself  as  being 

sufficient to bring real-time bidding systems into compliance with the GDPR. 

•  Thirdly,  the complainants  argue  that the CNIL  investigation did  not focus on the 

legitimacy of the processing of personal data within the TCF. The CNIL did not look 

at the generation and distribution of the TC String as a stand-alone processing and 

therefore did not make any statement about it. 

132.  According  to  the  complainants,  the  CNIL's  decisions  in  the  Vectaury  case  are  therefore 

irrelevant,  as  it  was  a  clearly  different  case,  directed  against  a  different  party,  involving 

different  processing  operations  and  under  legislation  that  has  since  been  replaced.  The 

Litigation  Chamber  follows  the  position  of  the  complainants  and  does  not  discuss  the 

Vectaury case, which concerns a different case than the present one. 

31 

c.  Infringement  of  the  principles  of  integrity  and  confidentiality  (Articles  5.1.f  and  32  of  the 

GDPR) 

133.  According  to  the  complainants,  IAB  Europe  violates  the  integrity  and  confidentiality 

obligations of the GDPR because it facilitates the exchange of personal data in the TCF, in 

particular the exchange of the TC String, with numerous parties, without verifying whether 

all recipients of this personal data comply with the rules of the GDPR. 

134. 

It is certain that the TC String is shared with thousands of companies. The TC String must 

therefore  be  protected  by  appropriate  measures  in  accordance  with  Articles  5.1.f  et  32 

GDPR. However, IAB Europe has not built in an appropriate protection mechanism: As with 

all other processing in the OpenRTB system, there is no way to verify that recipients are 

effectively  processing  the  TC  String  in  accordance  with  the  GDPR.  Indeed,  none  of  the 

mechanisms  presented  by  IAB  Europe  is  based  on  real,  proactive  control  of  TCF 

compliance, the complainants argue. 

135.  The complainants dispute IAB Europe's argument that it has no obligation to enforce the 

TCF, and in particular the agreements made within the TCF. The complainants argue that it 

is indeed its obligation as a data controller to enforce the agreements within the TCF and, 

at least in this way, to provide certain guarantees for the secure processing of the TC String. 

136.  Secondly,  the  complainants  point  to  claims  by  IAB  Europe  that,  as  a  management 

organisation,  it  makes  "substantial  efforts"  to  enforce  the  agreements  within  the  TCF. 

According to the complainants, there is no evidence of these alleged "substantial efforts". 

They further argue that IAB Europe would have to verify each registered TCF participant's 

compliance with all  agreements, which given the scale of data processing  would imply  a 

huge investigation. Moreover, the complainants refer to the answer given by IAB Europe 

itself to the Inspection Service: "The reporting obligation itself is not currently monitored. 

Moreover, it is difficult to monitor it because it would be difficult for IAB Europe to establish 

whether or not or when a CMP had (or should have had) a "reasonable belief" that another 

party was not complying" 39. 

137.  Thirdly,  the  complainants  believe  that  IAB  Europe  is  wrong  to  try  to  hide  behind  the 

contractual arrangements. According to the complainants, the defendant claims that it is 

sufficient that participants are contractually obliged to report any non-conformity to IAB 

Europe. 

138.  The complainants also argue that IAB Europe, as the data controller of the TCF, is bound by 

Articles  5.1.f  and  32  of  the  GDPR,  although  it  is  practically  impossible  to  guarantee  the 

security  of  the  processed  TC  String  when  it  is  shared  with  thousands  of  recipient 

 

 

39 Letter from IAB Europe to the Inspection Service of 10 February 2020, p. 8. 

32 

companies. According to the complainants, the latter would mean that IAB Europe actively 

checks that all recipients of the TC String always comply with the obligations of the GDPR 

so that the processing of the received TC String would not be unlawful.  

139.  Moreover, according to the complainants, practice proves that almost all participants in the 

TCF unlawfully process the TC String, as not one CMP, not one publisher and not one vendor 

provide  information  on  the  processing  of  the  TC  String,  its  purpose,  legal  basis  or  the 

categories of recipients. This would imply, according to the complainants, that the transfer 

of  the  TC  String  to  these  parties  is  inherently  a  personal  data  breach  which,  given  its 

immense scale, gives rise to an obligation to report to the supervisory authorities. 

140.  The practical impossibility of providing the necessary safeguards for the protection of the 

personal data (in particular the TC String) of data subjects, when shared with thousands of 

recipients  within  the  OpenRTB  system,  shows,  according  to  the  complainants,  that  IAB 

Europe is in breach of its obligations under Articles 5.1.f and 32 GDPR. 

d.  The  systematic  transfer  of  the  TC  String  to  third  countries  without  adequate  protection 

(breach of Article 44 of the GDPR)  

141.  The complainants argue that IAB Europe has set up the TCF in such a way that personal data 

— including the TC String, because it is integrated into the  bid requests — is structurally 

transferred  in  the  context  of  OpenRTB  to  numerous  companies  outside  the  European 

Economic Area (EEA), without adequate protection being provided for these transfers. 

142.  The complainants refer to the Ad Exchange Xandr (based in the USA), which is affiliated to 

IAB Europe's TCF and therefore receives at least the TC String from EEA users, including 

the complainants. As data controller for  the processing  of personal  data in  the TCF, IAB 

Europe should provide a mechanism for the transfer of personal data so that Ad Exchanges 

established outside the EEA may receive the TC String. 

143.  Exchanges of the TC String via real-time bidding systems such as OpenRTB are structural 

in nature and repeat themselves continuously in fractions of seconds. After all, the TC String 

is sent along with the bid requests. This would make it impossible for IAB Europe, according 

to the complainants, to invoke any of the exceptions in Article 49 GDPR. 

144.  Appropriate  safeguards  would  be  the  only  way  for  IAB  Europe  to  organise  transfers  of 

personal data in the TCF. However, at present IAB Europe does not provide any  form of 

appropriate safeguards for the transfer of the TC String through real-time bidding systems 

such as OpenRTB. 

33 

145.  In  line  with  the  Schrems  II  judgment,  IAB  Europe,40  in  addition  to  selecting  a  form  of 

adequate safeguards, should also have taken additional measures to prevent personal data 

from  being  processed  in  a  non-compliant  manner  in  third  countries.  However,  these 

additional measures are just as lacking as appropriate safeguards. The TC String is shared 

in  a  blind  manner  with  an  indefinite  number  of  participants  in  the  OpenRTB  system, 

wherever in the world they may be located. 

 

A.7. - Summary of the defendant's rejoinder dd. 25 March 2021 

A.7.1. - Organisations that process personal data within the RTB system are responsible for 

complying with the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive  

146.  The  defendant  first  argues  that  any  party  participating  in  RTB  and  using  the  OpenRTB 

specification can intervene in the technical storage and/or access operations on a user's 

device (e.g. the placing of website cookies) under the ePrivacy Directive, and/or act as a data 

controller  or  processor  of  personal  data  (e.g.  for  digital  advertising  purposes)  under  the 

GDPR.  Where  appropriate,  all  of  these  parties  are  responsible  for  complying  with  their 

obligations under the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive when engaging in RTB. 

147. 

In addition, according to the defendant, there are thousands of companies engaged in RTB 

and  using  the  OpenRTB  specification,  which,  however,  do  not  participate  in  the  TCF. 

Similarly, parties may use the TCF for purposes other than RTB. IAB Europe also stresses 

that publishers can use the TCF for a range of online advertising scenarios other than the 

OpenRTB specification - including other types of RTB protocols, but also online advertising 

that does not involve RTB at all, such as the direct sale of advertising inventory. 

148.  The defendant also refutes the complainants' allegations that RTB is inherently illegal by 

referring  to  the  UK  supervisory  authority's  (ICO)  report  which  merely  stated  that  RTB 

"requires organisations to take responsibility for  their own data processing, and that the 

industry is collectively reforming RTB". The ICO is also said to have highlighted the good 

faith efforts of stakeholders such as IAB UK to contribute to this reform process in a more 

recent publication41. 

149.  Furthermore, the defendant states that several supervisory authorities have called for ways 

to increase transparency for data subjects by clearly identifying the data controllers with 

whom personal data will be shared, by specifying the processing purposes and by enabling

data  subjects  to  exercise  control  over  their  personal  data.  It  is  precisely  this  kind  of 

transparency measure that IAB Europe and the TCF aim to support. 

150.  Within the framework of the TCF, data subjects are given the opportunity to give their prior 

approval to a number of identified third parties (adtech vendors) and processing purposes. 

According to IAB Europe, this transparency and prior checking is an appropriate substitute, 

from  a  legal  compliance  perspective,  for  real-time,  on-the-fly,  one-by-one  consent  for 

access, storage and data processing by data controllers. 

A.7.2.  -  IAB  Europe  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  the  alleged  illegal  practices  of  RTB 

participants, as the TCF is completely separate from RTB  

151.  The defendant emphasises that the TCF is only one of many optional approaches that data 

controllers  may  choose  to  help  ensure  compliance  with  transparency  and  consent 

requirements  when  processing  personal  data  for  RTB  or  other  advertising  purposes. 

Consequently,  the  responsibility  for  compliance  and  for  the  actual  decisions  on  the 

purposes  and  means  of  these  personal  data  processing  operations  lies  entirely  with  the 

parties engaged in RTB, and not with IAB Europe. 

152.  The defendant also states that IAB Europe had contact with several supervisory authorities 

after the roll-out of the first version of the TCF, as well as with several publishers. Following 

these  discussions,  the  second  version  of  the  TCF  was  developed,  in  which  several 

processing purposes were bundled under one title in so-called "stacks", and the legitimate 

interest  was  introduced  as  a  possible  legal  basis.  Furthermore,  the  TCF  v2  introduces 

additional  purposes and "publisher controls"  that  allow publishers to  restrict access to  a 

particular purpose to a subset of adtech vendors. 

153.  Finally,  the  defendant  clarifies  that  IAB  Europe  has  always  intended  to  have  the  TCF 

adopted as a transnational code of conduct.  

154.  In its initial submission, the defendant puts forward procedural arguments concerning the 

competence of the DPA and the way in which the complaints and the investigation were 

handled. These defences are set out below in Section A.9. 

155.  In its summary submission, the defendant also claims that the manner in which the DPA 

conducted the proceedings does not comply with Article 57 of the GDPR. However, since 

the complainants were unable to respond, the debates were reopened at the request of the 

Litigation Chamber. 

 

35 

A.8. - Hearing and reopening of debates 

156.  In accordance with Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the Data Protection Authority, a 

hearing was organised, to which all parties shall be invited. The hearing took place on 11 June 

2021.  

157.  An  official  report  of  the  hearing  was  drawn  up  in  order  to  give  details  and  additional 

information which were made during the hearing, without repeating the elements set out in 

the  submission.  The  parties  were  also  given  the  opportunity  to  submit  their  written 

comments  on  the  record.  A  number  of  elements  mentioned  below  are  relevant  to  the 

present decision. 

158.  In the context of the hearing, the  Inspection Service first confirmed its position that IAB 

Europe acts as a data controller for the processing of personal data under the Transparency 

and Consent Framework (hereinafter "TCF"), but not for OpenRTB.  

159.  The Inspection Service also clarified that personal data is collected as provided for in the 

TCF Policies, in the Terms and Conditions42 and in the privacy policy, as well as in the context 

of the TC String values stored in a  euconsent-v2 cookie, the latter as an expression of a 

user's  preferences  must  also  be  regarded  as  personal  data.  The  Inspection  Service  also 

emphasises that the TC String as such does not contain any information relating directly or 

indirectly to  the taxonomy of the website to which the TC String refers. This last aspect 

concerns an essential distinction between the preferences of the user that are collected in 

the  context  of  the  TCF,  and  the  personal  data  of  that  same  user  that  are  collected  and 

distributed within the OpenRTB system. In conclusion, the  Inspection Service states that 

the  TC  String  values  and  the  euconsent-v2  cookie  do  not  in  themselves  allow  the 

identification of  an individual  user. Although both  elements contain personal  data, in the 

sense  that  the  information  relates  to  one  natural  person,  the  Inspection  Service  also 

confirms  that  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  the  specific  data  subject  on  the  basis  of  that 

information alone. 

160.  During  the  hearing,  the  defendant  raised  a  procedural  point,  namely  that  the  Litigation 

Chamber is not permitted to rule on the complainants' submission before an analysis has 

been carried out on the consistency of their  written submissions in comparison  with the 

complaints. The defendant also requests that the Litigation Chamber rule on the necessity 

of requesting a supplementary investigation by the Inspection Service, as allegedly required 

by Article 57.1.f GDPR. The Litigation Chamber will decide on this procedural point in the 

present decision43.

36 

161.  The  complainants  responded  orally  to  the  defendant's  procedural  arguments  during  the 

hearing.  

162.  With regard to the timing of the TC String generation, the defendant emphasises that the 

capture of the exact creation time cannot lead to the uniqueness of a TC String, as there is 

a  chance  that  two  unidentified  users  may  give  the  same  preferences  at  the  same  time. 

Moreover, this timestamp alone is not sufficient to speak of a unique string, since the values 

of  the  TC  String  are  not  persistent  and  may  vary  over  time  or  according  to  the  visited 

websites.  

163.  The  defendant  also  states  that  the  global  consent  cookies  scenario,  in  which  the 

preferences stored in one TC String apply across several websites, is not relevant in view of 

the limited scope at the time of the hearing44, as well as the intention of IAB Europe, as a 

result  of  the  finding  that  a  global  consent  does  not  meet  the  requirement  of  a  specific 

consent45, to stop supporting this functionality and to phase it out in the weeks following 

the hearing. 

164.  As regards the question whether the allocation of a subdomain of consensu.org to CMP by 

means of a DNS delegation can be regarded as a determination of the means of processing, 

the defendant submits that, as a result of the DNS delegation, each subdomain refers to 

servers of the CMPs, which are moreover the only ones able to read the TC Strings from the 

users' devices. In addition, the defendant submits that the registration of a subdomain of 

consensu.org  is  purely  optional  and,  as  such,  does  not  constitute  an  essential  means  of 

processing.  

165.  The  complainants  emphasise,  on  the  other  hand,  that  a  DNS  delegation  can  always  be 

reversed by the defendant, and that it is irrelevant that the defendant does not have access 

to the euconsent-v2 cookies. The complainants also point out that the DNS delegation can 

be  regarded  as  an  essential  means  of  processing,  since  the  DNS  delegation  is  used  to 

distribute the TC String further through the TCF ecosystem. 

166.  Concerning the existence of interfaces between the TCF and OpenRTB, the complainants 

stress that both systems are inherently intertwined because of the link between, on the one 

hand, the TC String that the CMPs generate according to the instructions of the TCF and, 

on the other hand, bid requests, which are regulated by the OpenRTB.  In other words, the 

latter are used as vehicles to spread the TC String throughout the OpenRTB ecosystem.  

 

 

44 According to the defendant, the number of globally scoped consents was at most 0.5% of all consent and preferences 
collected worldwide.  
45 Article 4.11 GDPR: "consent" of the data subject means any freely given specific, informed and unambiguous expression 
of will by which the data subject accepts, by declaration or unambiguous active act, the processing of personal data relating 
to him or her. 

37 

167.  The defendant states that both systems can function independently and that the TCF was 

developed with OpenRTB as a starting point and could be used in that context, as OpenRTB 

is the most widely used standard in the industry.  According to the defendant, this does not 

mean that the TCF is an essential means of using OpenRTB. 

168.  The defendant argues that the elaboration by the defendant of a future Code of Conduct in 

relation  to  the  TCF  cannot  be  regarded  as  proof  of  its  (shared)  responsibility  for  the 

processing  of  personal  data  in  the  context  of  the  TCF.    Complainants  add  that  it  is 

impossible to verify compliance with the GDPR by participating organisations, even if the 

rules are clearly defined in an enforcement policy. 

169.  In  this  regard,  the  defendant  refers  to  the  development  and  gradual  implementation  of 

automated compliance programmes to monitor the extent to which CMPs and advertisers 

(as well  as other  adtech  vendors) comply  with  the TCF  Policies, including future internal 

audits of the processes at the aforementioned parties. The defendant also emphasises that 

the  TCF  already  provides  for  sanctioning  measures  against  adtech  vendors  that  do  not 

adhere to the framework, such as temporary suspensions of their participation in the TCF. 

170.  With regard to the link between the TC String and the individual user, the defendant takes 

the  view  that  the  TCF  does  not  determine  how  this  is  done,  nor  how  the  TC  String  is 

subsequently communicated to the adtech vendors, as these elements are entirely subject 

to the OpenRTB specification. 

171.  The  defendant  clarifies  that  the  use  of  the  consensu.org  domain  is  purely  optional,  and 

moreover,  this  domain  was  not  developed  for  the  purpose  of  processing  or  storing  logs 

related to the TC Strings.  

172.  Finally, the defendant emphasises its position that the TC String only constitutes personal 

data after it has been linked in the context of the OpenRTB to a bid request which already 

contains personal data. 

173.  On 9 August 2021, after deliberation, the Litigation Chamber decides to reopen the debates 

on specific procedural arguments of IAB Europe.   

174.  On  23  August  2021,  the  Litigation  Chamber  received  the  first  submissions  from  the 

defendant. The defendant states that the DPA infringed Article 57.1.a and 57.1.f GDPR and 

Article 94(3) DPA Act. The DPA also allegedly failed to comply with the principle of sound 

administration and the defendant's rights of defence. 

175.  With regard to Article 57.1.f GDPR, the defendant first of all claims that the complainants 

have submitted new allegations in their submission, which are thus more extensive than the 

original  complaints.  Moreover,  according  to  the  defendant,  the  DPA  did  not  proactively 

investigate  these  new  allegations  by  charging  the  Inspection  Service  with  a  new  or 

38 

supplementary investigation. As a result, the defendant considers that the DPA has failed 

to fulfil its duties under Article 57.1.f GDPR.   

176.  Furthermore,  the  defendant  claims  that,  by  requesting  an  initial  investigation  from  the 

Inspection Service, the Litigation Chamber has de facto bound itself to a procedure in which 

every allegation or defence must be investigated by the Inspection Service. According to 

the  defendant,  the  decision  of  the  Litigation  Chamber  not  to  request  a  supplementary 

investigation  after  an  initial  investigation  and  the  submission  of  the  defences  led  to  an 

infringement of Article 94(3) DPA Act. 

177.  The defendant also states that, in the absence of an investigation by the Inspection Service 

into supposed new allegations in the complainants' defences and a legal classification of 

those allegations, it was unable to defend itself adequately against the complaints made 

against IAB Europe. Thus, the procedure before the Litigation Chamber could be considered 

to  have  evolved  from  an  inquisitorial  to  an  adversarial  procedure  in  which  the  Litigation 

Chamber would no longer have acted as an administrative dispute resolution body, taking 

mainly into account the claims and documents of the complainants, with the result that the 

rights of defence of IAB Europe have been violated, according to the defendant. 

178.  On 6 September 2021, the Litigation Chamber received the complainants' submission. The 

complainants  consider,  first  of  all,  that  the  defendant's  new  pleas  exceeded  the  limited 

scope of the reopened debates.  

179.  Secondly, the complainants argue that the nature of the proceedings has not changed in 

any way, as the proceedings were started because of complaints made to the DPA, in other 

words, as an adversarial procedure, and have remained so throughout.  

180.  Thirdly, the complainants refer to Articles 63(2) and 94 DPA Act, as a counter-argument to 

the assertion that the Litigation Chamber should have had the Inspection Service examine 

each  of  the  pleas  raised  by  the  complainants.  After  all,  these  provisions  provide  the 

Litigation  Chamber  with  a  discretionary  power  to  decide  whether  or  not  an  (additional) 

investigation by the Inspection Service is necessary.   

181.  Furthermore,  the  complainants  argue  that  it  is  impossible  for  the  Litigation  Chamber  to 

have an investigation or supplementary investigation carried out by the Inspection Service 

after the parties' submissions and exhibits,  taking into  account the  time limit of 30 days 

after, respectively, the referral to the Litigation Chamber by the First Line Service following 

the  lodging  of  the  complaint,  or  the  Litigation  Chamber's  reception  of  the  Inspection 

Service's initial investigation report, under Article 96 of the DPA Law.  

182.  With regard to the defendant's argument that the way the Litigation Chamber handled the 

case violates Article 57.1.f GDPR, the complainants point out that, first of all, this provision 

has  no  direct  effect  in  the  sense  that  the  defendant  can  derive  rights  from  it.  The 

complainants  also  argue  that  this  provision  cannot  affect  the  internal  structure  and 

39 

functioning  of  the  supervisory  authorities,  which,  with  regard  to  the  DPA  and,  more 

specifically,  the  division  of  powers  between  its  Inspection  Service  and  its  Litigation 

Chamber, are subject to Belgian administrative (procedural) law. 

183.  Furthermore, the complainants state that Article 57.1.f GDPR does not refer to an obligation 

on the part of the Litigation Chamber to request an investigation by the Inspection Service 

into the complaints, but to the power of the supervisory authorities to close the case. 

184.  In addition, the complainants argue that the decision of the Litigation Chamber to request 

an  investigation  from  the  Inspection  Service  in  no  way  prevents  it  from  relying  on  the 

submissions and exhibits submitted by the parties, contrary to the defendant's position. 

185.  As  regards  the  defendant's  alleged  failure  to  comply  with  the  principle  of  due  care,  the 

complainants submit that the Litigation Chamber is required under that principle to study 

properly all the exhibits in the file so that its decision is based on a correct and complete 

presentation of the facts. However, this principle again does not imply in any way that the 

Litigation Chamber must have a (supplementary) investigation carried out by the Inspection 

Service for every exhibit. 

186.  As regards the defendant's rights of defence, the complainants maintain that, on the basis 

of the Inspection Service's various investigative reports and the submissions and exhibits 

submitted by the complainants, the defendant was adequately informed of the alleged facts 

and  infringements  of  law.  Also,  according  to  the  complainants,  the  defendant  was  given 

sufficient  opportunity  to  defend  itself  in  writing  against  the  legal  and  factual  allegations 

made  by  the  complainants,  given  that  the  defendant  was  offered  two  rounds  of 

submissions. 

187.  Finally, the complainants refer to the lack of concrete examples, in the defendant's latest 

submissions, of alleged new allegations on which the defendant was unable to conclude or 

which were not investigated by the Inspection Service. 

188.  On 13 September 2021, the Litigation Chamber received the defendant's response. 

189.  According  to  the  defendant,  only  the  inspection  report  determines  the  extent  of  the 

allegations,  provided  that  the 

inspection  report 

is  meaningful  and  based  on  a 

comprehensive  examination  of  the  facts.  Furthermore,  the  defendant  submits  that  the 

decision of the Litigation Chamber to request an investigation by the Inspection Service has 

resulted in the procedure as a whole becoming an "inquisitorial" procedure, irrespective of 

whether the procedure has its origin in the complaints filed with the DPA. According to the 

defendant,  the  decision  of  the  Litigation  Chamber  not  to  subsequently  request  a 

supplementary  investigation  and  to  base  the  further  proceedings  solely  on  the  parties' 

submissions and exhibits amounts to a breach of its rights of defence. 

40 

190.  In  addition,  the  defendant  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  period  of  thirty  days  provided  for  in 

Article 96(1) DPA Act does not apply to the request by the  Litigation Chamber to have a 

supplementary investigation carried out by the Inspection Service.  

191.  The defendant bases that reasoning on the distinction made in general administrative law 

between expiry periods and periods of order. In particular, the  defendant takes the view 

that, in the absence of formal provisions in the DPA Act to the effect that exceeding the 30-

day  time  limit  results  in  a  loss  of  jurisdiction  for  the  Litigation  Chamber,  the  time  limits 

provided for in Article 96 must be complied with, although not on pain of invalidity of the 

decision rendered too late. According to the defendant, the Litigation Chamber therefore 

remains  competent  to  make  a  decision  for  supplementary  investigation  even  after  the 

expiry of the 30-day period of order. That interpretation, the defendant argues, is in fact the 

result  of  the  greater  importance  of  the  right  to  a  defence  over  the  right  to  expeditious 

proceedings before the Litigation Chamber. 

192.  As  regards  the  direct  effect  of  Article  57.1.f  GDPR,  the  defendant  submits  that  the 

existence of a margin of appreciation for the Member States does not exclude the direct 

effect of a provision, but implies an examination of whether that provision is intended to 

provide a guarantee for the parties. The defendant takes the view that Article 57.1.f GDPR 

fulfils  this  requirement  and  clarifies  that  its  argument  for  requesting  an  supplementary 

investigation is furthermore limited to an assessment in fact and in law of the supporting 

points in the proceedings. 

193. 

In conclusion, the defendant states that it has not received a clear statement of the nature 

and scope of the charges, except for the allegations made in the complainants' defences. In 

that  regard,  the  defendant  submits  that  the  technical  inspection  reports  contain  merely 

technical  descriptions,  in  which,  moreover,  the  TC  String  is  not  mentioned  anywhere.  In 

Section A.9. - Procedural objections raised by the defendant, the Litigation Chamber will 

demonstrate  why  the  procedural  rights,  including  those  relating  to  the  specificity  of  the 

charges, were sufficiently respected. 

 

A.9. - Procedural objections raised by the defendant 

A.9.1.  -  Infringements  of  procedural  rules  applicable  to  the  inspection  report  and  of 
fundamental rights and freedoms of IAB Europe  

a. Inadmissibility of the complaints 

194.  The  defendant  first  of  all  argues  that  some  of  the  complaints  were  filed  in  English  and 

therefore do not meet the formal admissibility requirements set out in Article 60 DPA Act.  

41 

195.  In addition, the defendant takes the view that some of those filing the complaints cannot be 

regarded either as "complainants" or as "parties" within the meaning of Articles 93, 95, 98 

and 99 DPA Act, with the result that their submissions must be excluded from the debates 

and cannot be taken into account.  

196.  Finally, the defendant asserts that the measures that the DPA can impose under Article 100 

of the DPA Act do not provide any benefit to these complainants.  

197. 

IAB Europe thus considers that the case was unlawfully initiated - in particular on the basis 

of several inadmissible complaints - with the result that the claims against IAB Europe must 

be rejected and cannot lead to the imposition of a valid sanction or corrective measure on 

IAB Europe. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

198.  The Litigation Chamber refers to Article 77.1 of the GDPR, according to which data subjects 

have the right to lodge a complaint in the Member State where they usually reside, have 

their place of work or where the alleged infringement was committed. The four complaints 

in English referred to by the defendant were not lodged directly with the DPA, but with the 

national supervisors with jurisdiction for each of the complainants, in accordance with the 

locally  applicable  language  legislation.  In  casu,  the  four  complaints  have  been  filed 

respectively with the Polish supervisory authority, with the Slovenian SA, with the Italian SA 

as well as with the Spanish SA, which then referred these complaints to the Belgian DPA as 

the lead supervisory authority, in accordance with the cooperation procedure provided for 

under Article 56 GDPR.  

199.  The  formal  admissibility  requirements  provided  for  under  Article  58  DPA  Act,  and  more 

specifically the requirement that a complaint be drawn up in one of the national languages, 

only  apply  to  complaints  filed  directly  with  the  DPA.  Any  other  view  would  erode  the 

effective operation of the right to complain, one of the core elements of the GDPR. Indeed, 

a  complainant  who  submits  his  complaint  to  an  authority  of  a  Member  State  cannot  be 

expected to submit it in the language of the Member State of the lead authority, if that is 

different  from  the  authority  to  which  he  submits  his  complaint.  It  follows  that  the  four 

complaints in question were validly filed with the DPA. 

200.  In relation to the lack of interest of Fundacja Panoptykon, as well as other complainants, in 

the  complaints  lodged  through  the  European  "one-stop  shop"  mechanism,  raised  by  the 

defendant, the Litigation Chamber notes that Fundacja Panoptykon lodged the complaint 

with the Polish supervisory authority on behalf of Ms Katarzyna Szymielewicz in accordance 

with  Article  80.1  GDPR.  On  the  basis  of  this  provision,  the  complainant  has  the  right  to 

instruct Fundacja Panoptykon to lodge the complaint on its behalf.  

42 

201.  The  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  IAB  Europe  does  not  explain  at  all  why  Fundacja 

Panoptykon  should  not  be  considered  a  complainant  and  party  here.  In  addition,  in  the 

absence  of  doubts  whether  the  other  complaints  were  admissible,  the  argument  by  the 

defendant would not make any difference towards the outcome of this decision. 

202.  This argument must therefore be rejected.  

b. The inspection report is not properly reasoned 

203.  The defendant then goes on to address the inadequate reasoning in the inspection report. 

As a result of the lack of a clearly worded statement of reasons in the inspection report - 

including the lack of a clearly identified data controller in connection with a clearly defined 

data processing activity - the defendant argues that the inspection report not only infringes 

the DPA's obligation to provide express and sufficient reasons for its decisions, but also 

constitutes a clear breach of IAB Europe's rights of defence. Consequently, the inspection 

report infringes IAB's rights of defence as laid down in Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 of the 

Charter of Fundamental Rights. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

204.  IAB Europe's claim that the Inspection Service's report of 13 July 2020 is not sufficiently 

reasoned is incorrect. As can also be seen from the reflection of this Inspection Report in 

this decision, the Inspection Report contains detailed reasoning.    

205.  Furthermore, IAB Europe overlooks the fact that, in addition to the report of 13 July 2020, 

the  Inspection  Service  produced  other  very  extensive  and  detailed  technical  reports 

(Exhibits 24 and 53). Finally, the Litigation Chamber points to the extensive written and oral 

exchange of views between the parties before its Chamber. IAB Europe's simple assertion 

of  failure  to  respect  its  rights  of  defence  is  therefore  without  merit,  as  set  out  in  the 

following paragraphs.  

c. Incompleteness and bias of the inspection report 

206.  The defendant refers to Article 58.4 GDPR, which provides that the procedure before the 

DPA must be conducted in compliance with "appropriate safeguards, including [...] the due 

process  of  law".  According  to  the  defendant,  that  principle  applies  equally  to  the 

investigation  carried  out  by  the  Inspection  Service  and  to  the  findings  set  out  in  the 

inspection report. 

207.  Referring  to  the  similarities  with  the  role  and  duties  of  a  prosecutor  in  ordinary  criminal 

proceedings,  the  defendant  claims  that  the  basic  principles  of  loyalty,  impartiality  and 

independence also apply to the Inspection Service. The defendant refers to Section IV of its 

submission  and  considers  that  relevant  exculpatory  elements,  of  which  the  Inspection 

Service was or should have been aware, are missing from the inspection report. 

43 

208.  The  defendant,  emphasising  that  the  DPA  is  obliged  to  maintain  the  presumption  of 

innocence  of  a  defendant  at  all  times,  including  during  the  investigative  phase  of 

proceedings which may lead to penalties of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 

6 ECHR, considers that its presumption of innocence has been infringed and that the claims 

against IAB Europe must therefore be dismissed. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

As regards the autonomy of the Litigation Chamber from the other bodies of the 
DPA, including the Inspection Service 

209.  The  Litigation  Chamber  first  notes  that  the  defendant  seems  to  confuse  the  role  and 

prerogatives of the Litigation Chamber with those of the other bodies of the DPA. 

210.  As indicated above, the Litigation Chamber is the administrative disputes body of the DPA 

pursuant  to  Article  33(1)  DPA  Act.  The  provisions  governing  the  procedure  before  the 

Litigation Chamber (see Articles 92 to 100 DPA Act) do not show that it is in any way bound 

by the findings of any other body of the DPA. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber is not 

bound by the findings of the Inspection Service. 

211. 

It is also recalled that the  Inspection Service submitted not one but several detailed and 

technical  reports  clearly  setting  out  the  deficiencies  attributable  to  the  defendant  and 

substantiating its position with the help of legislative, jurisprudential and factual sources, as 

the  complainants  point  out.  The  defendant  had  access  to  those  reports.  Moreover,  the 

defendant responded in detail to the reports of the Inspection Service. 

212.  The defendant further submits that the Inspection Service's report of 13 July 2020 is not 

exculpatory,  but  merely  incriminating,  because  the  report  does  not  contain  "certain 

exculpatory  elements"  of  IAB  Europe.  The  defendant  also  refers,  without  further 

specification, to Section IV of its submission, in which it sets out its arguments on the merits. 

In the absence of more detailed information on the exculpatory elements that were omitted 

from  the  abovementioned  report  of  the  Inspection  Service,  that  complaint  must  be 

rejected. 

213.  The Litigation Chamber notes that even if the defendant's argument were to be followed, 

quod non, it could nevertheless be concluded, as the Market Court has already indicated, 

that  the  proceedings  before  the  Litigation  Chamber  were  not  unlawful  in  so  far  as  both 

parties were given the opportunity to put forward their arguments in their submissions46.  In 

view of the complexity of the system, the Litigation Chamber was not able to specify every 

technical aspect of the system against which charges were brought against the defendant 

 

 

46 Market Court, 2019/AR/741, 12 June 2019, p. 12, available on the website of the DPA. 

44 

at the outset of the proceedings before the Litigation Chamber, on 13 October 2020, i.e. at 

the time when the parties were invited to present their written submissions (art. 98 DPA 

Act).  However,  in  order  to  ensure  the  procedural  rights  of  the  parties,  the  Litigation 

Chamber  firstly  ensured  that  the  defendant  had  sufficient  opportunities  to  present  its 

arguments before the Litigation Chamber, and secondly, that it remained within the scope 

of the initial complaints and the Inspection Services' reports, communicated to both parties 

prior to their written submissions. 

As regards the legal framework for the Inspection Service's investigations   

214. 

It should also be recalled that the Inspection Service may conduct any investigation, hold 

any hearing and collect any information it deems useful in the course of its duties in order 

to ensure compliance with the fundamental principles of personal data protection47. 

215.  The Litigation Chamber also points out that the intervention of the Inspection Service in the 

proceedings consists of recording findings and that it has no power to impose penalties. 

216.  Contrary  to  the  defendant's  contention,  the  Inspection  Service  is  not  an  administrative 

authority of  criminal  law  within the  meaning  of Article 6  of the  European Convention on 

Human Rights (hereinafter: "ECHR"), as it has no power to impose penalties and its task is 

limited to making findings and transmitting them to the Litigation Chamber in its report. As 

indicated above48, the findings of the  Inspection Service  are only elements on which the 

Litigation Chamber bases its decision at a later stage of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the 

Litigation Chamber emphasises that the Inspection Service's investigation in the present 

case was conducted in an impartial manner, in accordance with the requirements of Article 

6 ECHR and Article 47 Charter. It disagrees with suggestions made by the defendant in so 

far as they call into question the impartiality of the Inspection Service. 

On respect for the right to a fair trial, including the right to a defence before the 
Litigation Chamber 

217.  The  Litigation  Chamber  agrees  with  the  defendant  on  the  importance  of  applying 

procedural safeguards relating to due process in the disputes before it. It is also established 

that these principles are effectively applied before the Litigation Chamber. 

 

 

47 Cf. Art. 64 DPA Act: "The Inspector General and the inspectors shall exercise the powers referred to in this Chapter for 
the purpose of supervision as provided for in Article 4(1) of this Act". Also see Art. 72(1) DPA Act: "Without prejudice to the 
provisions of this Chapter, the Inspector General and the inspectors may conduct any enquiry, control or audit, as well as 
collect any information they consider useful in order to ensure that the fundamental principles of the protection of personal 
data, within the framework of this Act and the laws containing provisions relating to the protection of processing of personal 
data, are effectively respected" (emphasis added). 
48 See para. 209-210 of this decision. 

45 

218.  As set out above49, the defendant's complaint concerning the alleged lack of reasoning and 

impartiality of the Inspection Service's report, on which the defendant relies to conclude 

that its right to a fair trial has been violated, must be rejected. 

219.  For the sake of completeness, the Litigation Chamber also points out that the Market Court 

has already ruled that — in the event that the procedural safeguards in the earlier stage of 

the  proceedings  were  not  guaranteed,  quod  non  —  parties  have  an  adequate  remedy 

against decisions of administrative bodies, in particular through the possibility of appeal to 

the Market Court50. 

220.  The Market Court added that a lack of impartiality on the part of an administrative authority 

does not necessarily constitute an infringement of Article 6.1 ECHR if a judicial authority 

with  full  power  of  review,  which  itself  respects  the  guarantees  of  Article  6.1  ECHR,  can 

review the decision at issue. 

221.  According  to  the  Market  Court,  an  infringement  of  the  principle  of  impartiality  of  the 

administration at an earlier stage does not necessarily entail a breach of the right to a fair 

trial if that infringement can be remedied at a subsequent stage. The possibility of an appeal 

to a court that respects the guarantees of Article 6 ECHR is intended to allow precisely such 

corrections51. 

222.  Specifically with regard to the Litigation Chamber, the Market Court ruled as follows:  

"[...] even then, this legal protection by the legal subject is only legally enforceable before a 

judge  (who  is  part  of  the  judiciary)  [...].  The  legal  possibility  of  bringing  an  action/recourse 
before the Market Court is intended to provide the litigant with the guarantee of Article 6.1 
ECHR and, more particularly, with the remedy provided for in Article 47 CFREU [Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union]".52 

223.  Therefore, in the absence of impartiality on the part of the Litigation Chamber, which is not 

the case here, and in so far as the Market Court exercises full judicial review of the decisions 

of the Litigation Chamber, it cannot be concluded, ipso facto, that the right to a fair hearing 

in the proceedings has been infringed. 

 

 

49 See para. 204 et seq. of this decision. 
50 "The legislator has given the citizen a conclusive legal remedy against the conduct of administrative bodies (in this case 
the  DPA)  by  providing  precisely  recourse  to  the  Market  Court",  Court  of  Appeal  Brussels,  Market  Court  section,  19th 
Chamber A, Market Court section, 2019/AR/741, 12 June 2019, p. 9. The judgements of the Market Court are available on 
the website of the DPA in their original language (Dutch or French).   
51"A lack of objective or structural impartiality on the part of an administrative authority does not necessarily constitute an 
infringement of Article 6.1 ECHR if the decision of that authority can subsequently be reviewed by a court of law with full 
jurisdiction and which offers all the guarantees provided for in Article 6.1. Consequently, an infringement of the principle of 
impartiality at an earlier stage does not necessarily lead to a denial of the right to a fair trial if that infringement can still be 
rectified at a later stage. The organisation of an appeal to a body that meets all the safeguards of Article 6 ECHR serves to 
make such redress possible", Court of Appeal of Brussels, Market Court Section, 19th Chamber A, Market Cases Chamber,

224.   For the sake of clarity and information, the Litigation Chamber notes that while the right to 

a defence forms part of the fundamental rights that constitute the legal order of the Union 

and are enshrined in the Charter53, the fact remains that, as the CJEU has held, the various 

components of the right to a fair trial, including the right to a defence, are not absolute in 

nature  and  that  any  restriction  may  be  possible  for  a  public  interest  purpose.  This 

assessment must be made in concreto:  

“However, the Court has already ruled that fundamental rights, including respect for the right 

to  a  defence,  are  not  absolute  but  may  include  restrictions,  provided  that  they  genuinely 
meet the objectives of general interest pursued by the measure in question and that, having 

regard to the objective pursued, they cannot be regarded as constituting a disproportionate 
and intolerable interference impairing the very substance of the rights guaranteed [...]. 

34. Moreover, whether the right to a defence have been infringed must be assessed in the 

light of the specific circumstances of each case [...]”54.  

A.9.2. - Infringements of the fundamental rights and freedoms of IAB Europe with regard to 
the general nature of the procedure for the DPA 

a.  Administrative  penalties  and  Articles  6  and  7  ECHR  and  Article  47  of  the  Charter  of 

Fundamental Rights of the European Union 

225.  The defendant submits that the measures and fines which the DPA is authorised to impose 

in the context of Articles 100 and 101 DPA Act, read in conjunction with Article 83 GDPR, 

must  be  classified  as  penalties  of  a  criminal  nature  within  the  meaning  of  international 

human rights conventions such as the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, having 

regard to the very nature of the offences and the nature and severity of the penalties which 

may be imposed on a party. As a result, according to the defendant, Articles 6 and 7 ECHR 

and Article 47 Charter of Fundamental Rights are applicable to the penalties which the DPA 

may impose on IAB Europe.  

226.  The defendant then considers that the wide margin between the minimum and maximum 

amount of administrative penalties of a criminal nature, which, moreover, according to the 

defendant, puts all infringements on an equal footing while failing to specify the severity of 

the  penalties  in  the  law  itself,  is  contrary  to  the  fundamental  principles  of  substantive 

legality and proportionality. The same reasoning applies to Articles 100 and 101 DPA Act, in 

conjunction with Article 83 GDPR, which, due to their imprecise and ambiguous wording, do 

 

 

53 In this regard, see CJUE, 18 July 2013,  Commission and Others v Kadi, C- -584/10 P, C- -593/10 P and C- -595/10 P, 
ECLI:EU:C:2013:518, points 98 and 99.

47 

not allow a party to appropriately assess the criminal law consequences of a certain conduct 

prior to its occurrence. 

227.  It would therefore follow that Articles 100 and 101 DPA Act, in conjunction with Article 83 

GDPR, are contrary to the fundamental principles of substantive legality and proportionality 

laid down in  Articles 6  and 7 of the ECHR  and Article 47 of the Charter  of  Fundamental 

Rights. For those reasons, the defendant considers that Articles 100 and 101 DPA Act, read 

in conjunction with Article 83 GDPR, cannot constitute a valid legal basis for the DPA to 

impose a sanction on IAB Europe. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

228.  First of all, the power to impose an administrative fine and the modalities of its application 

are laid down in the directly effective Article 83 of the GDPR. In line with the case law of the 

Market  Court,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  administrative  fines,  together  with  the 

other  corrective  measures  provided  for  in  Article  58  GDPR,  form  a  powerful  part  of  the 

enforcement tools available to the DPA55. 

229.  If the DPA finds one or more infringements of the regulations, it must determine the most 

appropriate corrective measure(s) to address that infringement. The measures available for 

this  purpose  are  listed  in Article  58.2.b  to  58.2.j  GDPR.  In  particular,  Article  58.2.i  GDPR 

provides that the supervisory authority has the power, depending on the circumstances of 

each case, to impose, in addition or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, 

an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR. This means that an administrative fine 

can be both a stand-alone (corrective) measure and a measure taken in conjunction with 

other  corrective  measures  (and  is  therefore  a  kind  of  complementary  measure).  The 

criminal provisions of Sections 83.4 to 83.6 GDPR allow the imposition of an administrative 

fine for most infringements. Nevertheless, the supervisory authority has the responsibility 

to always choose the most appropriate measure(s)56. 

230.  In  addition  to  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  GDPR  and  the  DPA  Act  on  the  level  of 

administrative fines that the Litigation Chamber may impose, the Litigation Chamber also 

relies  on  the  case  law  of  the  Market  Court57,  which  formulates  requirements  on  the 

predictability and reasoning of administrative fines imposed by the Litigation Chamber. For 

example, this case law has resulted in a form notifying the intention to impose a  sanction 

being submitted to the party concerned, who may react to it and send its comments to the

Litigation Chamber before it takes a decision. Accordingly, in  the present procedure, this 

form was  sent and the defendant submitted a reaction58.  

231.  The Litigation Chamber also refers to the case law of the Market Court, which determined 

that the GDPR does not provide for a specific fine tag or range for specific infringements, 

but only an upper limit or maximum amount. In practice, this means that the DPA can decide 

not only not to impose a fine on the offender, but also that, if it decides to impose a fine, it 

shall be between the minimum, starting at 1 EUR, and the maximum foreseen. The fine shall 

be decided by the DPA taking into account the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR59. 

232.  Furthermore, the Litigation Chamber also follows the Article 29 Data Protection Working 

Party's guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines under the GDPR, 

endorsed by the EDPB60, which detail the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR that a supervisory 

authority must apply when assessing whether to impose a fine, as well as the amount of the 

fine. 

233.  Furthermore, these guidelines also contain an explanation of Article 58 GDPR relating to 

the  measures  that  a  supervisory  authority  may  choose  to  take,  as  the  remedies  are 

inherently  different in nature and essentially have different purposes. Finally, it  specifies 

that  certain  measures  under  Article  58  GDPR  may  be  cumulative  and  thus  constitute  a 

regulatory action based on several remedies.  

234.  The Market Court, ruling with full jurisdiction, performs a legality and proportionality test of 

the  sanction  and  will  (only)  reduce  or  cancel  the  fine  in  case  of  serious  and  proven 

circumstances that the Litigation Chamber would not or not sufficiently take into account.  

235.  In short, this system sufficiently guarantees that the fundamental legal principles arising 

from Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 47 of the Charter are complied with. 

Legal framework for administrative fines 

Relevant provisions in the DPA Act 

236.  Pursuant  to  Article  100(1)(13)  of  the  DPA  Act,  the  Litigation  Chamber  has  the  power  to 

impose  administrative  fines.  The  Litigation  Chamber  may  decide  to 

impose  an 

administrative  fine  on  the  prosecuted  parties  in  accordance  with  the  general  terms  and 

conditions set out in Article 83 GDPR.  

237.  Pursuant to Article 103 DPA Act, if an offender  has committed several infringements by 

means of the same act only the heaviest administrative fine of the respective infringements

shall apply.   In the event of overlapping infringements, the rates of the administrative fines 

shall be added together without the total amount exceeding twice the highest amount of 

the fine applicable to the infringements committed. 

Relevant provisions in the GDPR 

238.  Once an infringement of the Regulation has been established, based on the assessment of 

the  facts  of  the  case,  the  competent  supervisory  authority  should  determine  the  most 

appropriate  corrective  measures  to  address  the  infringement.  The  provisions  of  Article 

58(2)(b)-(j)61  set  out  the  tools  that  supervisory  authorities  can  use  to  address  non-

compliance by a data controller or processor.  

a.  to  issue  warnings  to  a  data  controller  or  processor  that  intended  processing 

operations are likely to infringe provisions of this Regulation; 

b.  to issue reprimands to a data controller or a processor where processing operations 

have infringed provisions of this Regulation; 

c.  to  order  the  data  controller  or  the  processor  to  comply  with  the  data  subject's 

requests to exercise his or her rights pursuant to this Regulation; 

d.  to  order  the  data  controller  or  processor  to  bring  processing  operations  into 

compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified 

manner and within a specified period; 

e.  to  order  the  data  controller  to  communicate  a  personal  data  breach  to  the  data 

subject; 

f. 

to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing; 

g.  to order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the restriction of processing 

pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 GDPR, as well as the notification of such actions 

to recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed, in accordance with 

Articles 17(2) and 19 GDPR; 

h.  to  revoke a  certification,  or  order the certification  body to  revoke a  certification 

issued under Articles 42 and 43 GDPR, or order the certification body not to issue 

a certification if the certification requirements are no longer fulfilled; 

i.  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  each  case,  in  addition  to  or  instead  of  the 

measures referred to in this paragraph, to impose an administrative fine pursuant 

to Article 83 GDPR; and; 

 

 

61 Article 58(2)(a) states that a warning may be issued. In other words, in the case to which the provision relates, there is not 
yet a breach of the regulation.   

50 

j. 

to  order  the  suspension  of  data  flows  to  a  recipient  in  a  third  country  or  to  an 

international organisation. 

239.  The power to impose an administrative fine is regulated in Article 83 GDPR, which reads as 

follows: 

“General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines 

1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant 
to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 
6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 

2.  Administrative  fines  shall,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  each  individual  case,  be 
imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 
58(2). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount 
of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following: 
a) 

the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature 
scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects 
affected and the level of damage suffered by them; 

the intentional or negligent character of the infringement; 

a) 
b)  any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by 

c) 

data subjects; 
the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into account technical 
and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; 

d)  any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor; 
e) 

the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the 
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement; 
the categories of personal data affected by the infringement; 
the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, in 
particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the 
infringement; 

f) 
g) 

h)  where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the 

i) 

j) 

controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance 
with those measures; 
adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or approved 
certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and 
any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, 
such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the 
infringement. 

3. If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing 
operations,  infringes  several  provisions  of  this  Regulation,  the  total  amount  of  the 
administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement. 

4. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject 
to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2 % of 
the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher: 
b) 

the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39 
and 42 and 43; 
the obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43; 
the obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4). 

c) 
d) 

5. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject 
to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of 
the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher: 

51 

a) 

b) 
c) 

the basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to 
Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; 
the data subjects’ rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22; 
the transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international 
organisation pursuant to Articles 44 to 49; 

d)  any obligations pursuant to Member State law adopted under Chapter IX; 
e)  non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or 
the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or 
failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1). 

6. Non-compliance with an order by the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) 
shall, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 
20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual 
turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 

7. Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 
58(2),  each  Member  State  may  lay  down  the  rules  on  whether  and  to  what  extent 
administrative  fines  may  be  imposed  on  public  authorities  and  bodies  established  in  that 
Member State. 

8. The exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject 
to  appropriate  procedural  safeguards  in  accordance  with  Union  and  Member  State  law, 
including effective judicial remedy and due process. 

9. […]” 

240.  A reading of points (a) to (k) of Article 83(2) GDPR, as well as the additional explanations in 

paragraphs 3 to 6 of that same provision, is sufficient to refute the defendant's argument 

that the various offences listed in Article 83 RGPD are placed on an equal footing. 

241.  The various criteria to assess the severity of the penalties are clearly set out in Article 83 

itself and in recitals 148 to 150 GDPR. Article 83.2 also makes it clear that an analysis must 

be made "according to the circumstances of the case". 

242.  The Litigation Chamber already referred to the Guidelines on the application and setting of 

administrative  fines  under  the  GDPR,  endorsed  by  the  EDPB.  These  Guidelines  provide 

guidance on the interpretation of the individual facts of the case in the light of the criteria 

set out in Article 83.2 GDPR. The Guidelines bind the Litigation Chamber as an organ of the 

DPA, a member of the EDPB.  

243.  In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of the GDPR, recital 148 GDPR clarifies 

that  penalties,  including  administrative  fines,  should  be  imposed  for  any  breach  of  the 

Regulation,  in  addition  to  or  as  an  alternative  to  appropriate  measures  imposed  by  the 

supervisory authorities under this Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine 

likely  to  be  imposed  would  constitute  a  disproportionate  burden  to  a  natural  person,  a 

reprimand  may  be  issued  instead  of  a  fine.  Due  regard  should  however  be  given  to  the 

nature,  gravity  and  duration  of  the  infringement,  the  intentional  character  of  the 

infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any 

relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to 

the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against the data controller or 

52 

processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor. 

The imposition of penalties including administrative fines should be subject to appropriate 

procedural  safeguards  in  accordance  with  the  general  principles  of  Union  law  and  the 

Charter, including effective judicial protection and due process. 

244.  Contrary to what the defendant maintains, the GDPR does not therefore impose a minimum 

amount  of  fine,  but  only  maximum  amounts  which,  depending  on  the  infringements 

committed,  may  amount  to  2%  or  4%  of  the  turnover  of  a  data  controller,  or  EUR 

10,000,000 or 20,000,000 respectively. These amounts are of a dissuasive nature, and it 

is  for  the  Litigation  Chamber  to  modulate  the  amount  of  the  fine  according  to  the 

circumstances of the case, taking into account the requirement of proportionality and with 

a view to ensuring the effectiveness of the provisions of the GDPR. 

245.  Since the various offences listed in Article 83 GDPR are not treated in the same way and 

since  the  various  criteria  to  assess  the  severity  of  the  penalties  are  clearly  set  out,  the 

defendant's argument that the combined reading of Article 83 GDPR and Articles 100 and 

101 DPA Act infringes the principles of legality and proportionality, and thus Articles 6 and 

7 ECHR and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because of its 

vagueness must be rejected. 

246.  Article 83 GDPR is a directly effective provision of an EU Regulation and it is the task of the 

Litigation  Chamber  to  ensure  the  effective  operation  of  this  Regulation.  It  is  not  for  the 

Litigation Chamber, as a body of a national administrative authority, to rule on the possible 

unlawfulness of that provision. 

247.  In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled in its judgment no. 25/2016, of 18 February 2016 

(p24-28) that a single, wide margin for an administrative fine, allowing the administrative 

authority to adjust the administrative fine to the gravity of the infringement, does not violate 

the principle of legality: 

"B.18.2.  [...]  The  principle  of 

legality 

in  criminal  matters,  which  derives  from  the 

aforementioned  constitutional  and  treaty  provisions,  is  also  based  on  the  idea  that  the 

criminal  law  must  be  formulated  in  terms  which  enable  any  person,  at  the  time  when  he 
adopts a course of conduct, to determine whether that conduct is punishable or not and, 
where appropriate, to know the sanction to be imposed. [...] 

However, the principle of legality in criminal matters does not prevent the law from granting 

the court discretion. Indeed, the general nature of the laws, the diverse situations to which 
they apply and the evolution of the conduct they punish must be taken into account. 

B.18.3.   In the same way, to determine whether the ranges between the upper and lower 

limits  of  the  sentences  considered  by  the  ordering  body  are  so  broad  as  to  infringe  the 
principle of the foreseeability of the sanction, account must be taken of the specific features 
of the offences to which those penalties are attached. [...] 

53 

B.20.1.  The assessment of the seriousness of a crime and of the severity with which the 

crime may be punished is within the discretion of the competent legislature. It may impose 
particularly  severe  penalties  in  cases  where  the  offences  may  seriously  affect  the 
fundamental rights of individuals and the interests of the community. It is therefore up to the 

competent legislator to establish the limits and amounts within which the discretion of the 
court and of the administration must be exercised. The Court could only reject such a system 

if it were manifestly unreasonable. 

B.20.2.   The  ordering  body  cannot  be  blamed  for  wanting  to  rationalise  and  simplify  the 
environmental criminal law in force in the Region. In order to achieve that objective, it could 
establish  a  single  and  sufficiently  wide  margin  between the  upper  and  lower  limits  of  the 

sanction, both for criminal penalties and for alternative administrative fines, in order to allow 
the  court  or  the  administrative  authority  to  adjust  the  sanction  or  the  alternative 
administrative fine to the seriousness of the crime. 

B.20.3.   With regard specifically to the offence of exceeding the noise standards laid down 

by the Government, the contested provisions are addressed to persons subject to the law 
who are professionals and can assess with sufficient accuracy the seriousness of the offence 
they  are  committing  and  the  corresponding  severity  of  the  sanction  to  which  they  are 

subject. In addition, the choice of sanction must be justified, either by the judge or by the 
administrative authority. In the latter case, the decision is subject to judicial review. 

B.20.4.   It  follows  from  the  foregoing  that  the  contested  provisions  do  not  confer  on  the 
court or administrative authority any discretion going beyond the limits of what is permissible 
under the principle of the foreseeability of penalties 

248.  The defendant's argument that Articles 100 and 101 DPA Act in conjunction with Article 83 

GDPR,  which  form  the  basis  of  the  power  of  the  Litigation  Chamber  to  impose 

administrative penalties and fines, infringe the principles of legality and proportionality and 

thus the right to a fair hearing must therefore be rejected. 

b. The internal rules of the DPA do not comply with the fundamental principle of the  formal 

legality of criminal sanctions, enshrined in Articles 12 and 14 of the Belgian Constitution 

249.  The principle of formal legality, enshrined in Articles 12 and 14 of the Belgian Constitution, 

requires that the essential elements of the rules relating to the offences made punishable, 

the  nature  and  level  of  the  sanction,  and  the  procedure  guaranteeing  that  the  right  to  a 

defence are safeguarded, be laid down by the Chamber of Representatives in accordance 

with the legislative procedure laid down by the Belgian Constitution.  

250.  Since  this  principle  applies  not  only  to  criminal  penalties  stricto  sensu,  but  also  to 

administrative penalties of a criminal  nature,  it  is fully applicable to  the DPA  sanctioning 

procedure.  

54 

251. 

In  this  regard,  the  defendant  submits  that  various  aspects  of  the  DPA  sanctioning 

procedure are not laid down in a legislative text - in particular, not in the DPA Act, but in the 

Rules of Internal Procedure of 15 January 2019 (RIO). 

252.  As a result, the defendant considers that the current proceedings were conducted on the 

basis of procedural rules that are contrary to Articles 12 and 14 of the Belgian Constitution 

and therefore lack a valid legal basis, with the result that the complaints against IAB Europe 

must be dismissed. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

253.  The principle of legality means that the essential elements of an offence, such as its nature, 

the level of punishment and the procedural guarantees relating to it, must be determined 

by the legislator. 

254.  The Litigation Chamber notes that the only elements relating to the imposition of a sanction 

that are not contained in the GDPR, the DPA Act or the law of 30 July 2018, but in the Rules 

of Internal Order (RIO) of the DPA referred to by the defendant, are by no means essential 

elements for the imposition of fines.  Indeed, it is not the nature of the fine, nor the sanction, 

that  is  at  issue,  but  elements  of  a  secondary  or  organisational  nature,  for  example,  with 

regard to  the procedure to be followed in the absence of the president of the  Litigation 

Chamber (Article 44 RIO), or the number of members sitting per case (Article 43 RIO). 

255.  The Litigation Chamber also emphasises that the independence of a supervisory authority 

under Article 51 et seq. GDPR means that the organisation of its processes, including for 

example  the  assignment  of  members  to  a  procedure,  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  Data 

Protection  Authority,  of  course  within  the  limits  of  the  general  principles  of  good 

administration and the relevant national legislation. 

256.  The defendant's argument that the procedure before the Litigation Chamber infringes the 

principle of legality is therefore rejected. 

c. Appointment of members of the DPA violates Article 53 GDPR 

257.  The  defendant  claims  that  Article  39  DPA  Act,  which  regulates  the  appointment  of  the 

members  of  the  Litigation  Chamber,  does  not  in  any  way  clarify  the  modalities  of  the 

appointment  procedure.  In  particular,  nowhere  does  it  specify  how  the  hearing  of  the 

candidates should proceed, nor does the DPA Act require a written record of the hearing. 

Moreover,  the  nomination  takes  place  on  the  basis  of  a  secret  ballot  and  there  are  no 

guarantees  as  to  the  adequacy  of  the  information  on  the  candidates  provided  to  the 

members of the Chamber of Representatives.  

258.  According  to  the  defendant, the appointment of the members of the DPA, including  the 

members of the Litigation Chamber, therefore does not satisfy the requirements of Article 

55 

53 GDPR, which provides that the appointment must be made 'by means of a transparent 

procedure'. 

259.  In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  defendant  considers  that  the  members  of  the  Litigation 

Chamber are not in a position to make a legally valid decision in relation to IAB Europe in this 

case. For those reasons also, the claims against IAB Europe should be dismissed. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

260.  First of all, the  Litigation  Chamber  points out that  any imperfections in  the  appointment 

procedure of the members of the DPA cannot form part of these proceedings and that the 

parties cannot invoke a procedural interest in questioning the appointment procedure.  

261.  The Litigation Chamber reminds that the members of the Litigation Chamber are appointed 

by  the  House  of  Representatives  and  can  only  be  removed  from  their  positions  by  the 

House. Thus, neither the Litigation Chamber nor the Market Court are competent to rule on 

their appointment. In addition, the parties have no interests in requesting such a ruling. 

262.  Consequently, the Litigation Chamber rules that this plea is unfounded. 

d. The way in which the DPA has handled this procedure is not in line with its duties and powers 

under Article 57 GDPR 

263.  In conclusion, the defendant states, both in its initial submission and in the context of the 

reopening  of  the  debates,  that  the  way  in  which  the  DPA,  in  addition  to  the  original 

complaint,  also  considers  the  additional  complaints  and  grievances  made  by  the 

complainants, without the relevance of those additional allegations having been examined 

by the Inspection Service, makes the defence of IAB Europe considerably more difficult.  

264.  IAB Europe considers that this approach is not only fundamentally  incompatible with the 

duties and responsibilities of a supervisory authority as defined in Article 57 GDPR, but also 

has the effect that IAB Europe must only defend itself against the allegations contained in 

the inspection report, as opposed to the subsequent allegations made by the complainants 

in their subsequent submissions. 

Position of the Litigation Chamber 

265.  The Litigation Chamber  emphasises first of all that at no time did the  defendant  explain 

which new allegations are the subject of their defences and as such would violate its rights 

of defence. For this reason alone, the Litigation Chamber considers itself entitled to declare 

the defendant's plea unfounded. 

266.  Secondly,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  DPA  Act  in  no  way  prescribes  that  the 

Litigation Chamber is bound by an investigation report following an investigation requested 

to the Inspection Service. Indeed, it does not follow from any provision of the DPA Act that 

the  Litigation  Chamber  is  denied  the  opportunity  to  take  into  account  additional  or 

56 

supplementary  elements  to  the  report  of  the  Inspection  Service,  as  long  as  the 

consideration of these additional or supplementary elements is sufficiently justified in the 

decision and the right of defence is sufficiently guaranteed.  

267.  The Inspection Service may in any case decide not to investigate certain disputed points, in 

accordance with  its  prerogative under Article 64(2)  DPA Act. In such a case, however, it 

would be contrary to Article 57 GDPR as well as to the autonomy and independence of the 

Litigation  Chamber,  as  implemented  by  Articles  92  to  100  DPA  Act,  to  simply  bind  the 

Litigation Chamber to the findings of the Inspection Service, without taking into account 

the elements put forward in the debates by the parties in the course of the proceedings and 

in accordance with the right to be heard. 

268.  Thirdly,  the  Litigation  Chamber  rules  that  the  alleged  obligation  to  base  debates  on  the 

inspection report alone following an investigation by the Inspection Service does not apply. 

The  DPA  Act  does  not  provide  anywhere  that  the  Litigation  Chamber  should  base  its 

decision solely on the inspection report or on the parties' submissions. It is appropriate for 

a  supervisory  authority  to  also  consult  other  bodies  and  sources  in  order  to  be  able  to 

support its decisions if necessary. 

269.  With  regard  to  the  Inspection  Service's  assessment  with  a  view  to  a  supplementary 

investigation, and in particular the nature of the time limits provided for in Article 96 DPA 

Act,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  not  convinced  by  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the 

defendant. In the present case, the parties have had ample opportunity to make their views 

known  to  the  Litigation  Chamber  and  to  the  other  party  regarding  the  allegations  and 

charges,  including  the  operation  of  the  TCF,  the  processing  of  user  preferences  and 

permissions  in  the  TC  String,  as  well  as  the  interrelationship  between  the  TCF  and 

OpenRTB.  

270.  In addition, the Litigation Chamber finds that there is no doubt about the crucial importance 

of  the  TC  String  for  the  functioning  of  the  TCF.  As  a  result,  the  defendant  could  have 

expected from the start of the proceedings that the debates would focus on the processing 

of  data  in  the  context  of  the  TC  String.  Thus,  there  can  be  no  question  at  all  of  new 

allegations - in so far as they exist, given the lack of any concrete example with which the 

defendant substantiated its plea - in the complainants' submissions, since they constitute 

an explanation of the operation of the TCF, which is not disputed as being at the heart of the 

complaints against IAB Europe.  

271.  Bearing the above points in mind, the Litigation Chamber rules that this plea is insufficient 

both in fact and in law. 

57 

A.10. - Sanction form, European cooperation procedure and publication of the decision 

272.  The procedure before the Litigation Chamber includes an exchange of written submissions 

as well as an oral hearing of the parties involved, as normal steps towards a decision. If the 

Litigation Chamber proposes, after deliberation, to impose a (punitive) sanction, the Market 

Court  requires  the  Litigation  Chamber  to  provide  the  defendant  with  an  opportunity  to 

respond  to  the  intended  sanctions,  through  a  standard  form  covering  the  retained 

infringements and the criteria for determining the amount of the fine. This opportunity for 

contradiction, or right to be heard, pertains to the proposed sanctions only and is therefore 

only communicated to the defendant.  

273.  A  sanction  form  has  been  sent  on  11  October  2021,  informing  the  defendant  of  its 

infringements  against the GDPR  as well as of  the  Litigation Chamber’s intent  to  impose 

corrective  measures  and  an  administrative  fine.  IAB  Europe  submitted  its  response  on 

1 November,  2021.  The  defendant  contests  the  calculation  of  the  administrative  fine,  by 

claiming that the Litigation Chamber did not consider all relevant  elements for determining 

the amount of the administrative fine under Article 83.2 GDPR. Moreover, the defendant 

disagrees  with  the  Litigation  Chamber’s  consideration  of  the  total  worldwide  annual 

turnover  of  Interactive  Advertising  Bureau  Inc.  (IAB  Inc.)  for  the  calculation  of  the 

administrative fine, since the latter has no ownership stake in the defendant nor any say in 

the deployment of IAB Europe’s activities. The defendant clarifies that IAB Europe licences 

the ‘IAB’ brand name from IAB Inc., and that the various IAB organizations across Europe 

are separate and distinct organisations.  

274.  On 8 November, the complainants submitted a request to the Litigation Chamber, asking to 

be provided with a copy of the sanction form as well as the defendant’s reaction, based on 

the erroneous assumption that the defendant also received further insights into the draft 

decision of the Litigation Chamber. The Litigation Chamber responds on 9 November 2021 

that  it  will  not  disclose  the  sanction  form  to  the  complainants.  The  notification  of  the 

sanction form to the defendant takes place within the framework of an objective review of 

legality  and  with  the  specific  aim  of  respecting  the  defendant's  rights  of  defence,  in 

accordance  with  the  case  law  of  the  Market  Court.  The  defendant  is  thus  informed  in 

advance of the nature and severity of the sanction it risks and is given the opportunity to 

submit its final comments on this point to the Litigation Chamber. Notifying the sanction 

form  to the  complainants could not possibly  contribute to the same objective,  since the 

sanction envisaged would only be imposed on the defendant, not on the complainants, and 

would  therefore  not  directly  affect  the  interests  of  the  latter.  Neither  the  rights  of  the 

defence  nor  any  other  rule  of  law  require  that  the  complainants  be  able  to  put  forward 

additional arguments in relation to the penalty which may be imposed on the defendant. 

58 

275.  On 23 November 2021, the Litigation Chamber submitted its draft decision with the other 

concerned European supervisory authorities (hereinafter, ‘CSAs’), as foreseen under article 

60.3 GDPR. 

276.  On 18 December 2021 the Litigation Chamber received a letter from the complainants in 

response to the Litigation Chamber’s decision not to disclose the content of the sanction 

form to the complainants. More specifically, the complainants argued that they should be 

informed  whether  the  defendant  has  brought  new  elements  to  the  proceedings.  The 

Litigation Chamber notes that the debates were already closed at that time, and that the 

reaction of the defendant to the sanction form only pertained to elements concerning the 

sanction.   

277.  On  20  December  2021,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  notified  through  the  Internal  Market 

Information  (IMI)  system  of  a  relevant  and  reasonable  objection  (RRO)  submitted  by  the 

Dutch Authority for Personal Data (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens). The objection pertains 

to the absence of reasoning by the Litigation Chamber with respect to the Dutch NGO Bits 

of Freedom’s claim that the TCF makes it impossible for users to exercise their data subject 

rights. The Litigation Chamber has addressed this RRO in its revised draft decision62. 

278.  On  21  December  2021,  the  defendant  submitted  a  letter  to  the  Litigation  Chamber, 

requesting the suspension of the provisional enforcement of the decision, that the Belgian 

Data Protection Authority does not make the decision public  until  all appeals have been 

exhausted,  and  that  the  DPA  refrains  from  issuing  any  public  communication  about  the 

decision prior to any such final decision. Once again, the Litigation Chamber notes that the 

debates were already closed at that time. 

279.  On  21  December  2021,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  notified  of  a  relevant  and  reasonable 

objection introduced by the Portuguese National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD). 

The objection pertains to the absence of sanction by the Litigation Chamber with respect 

to the processing of TC Strings in the absence of a lawful ground under Article 6 GDPR. The 

CNPD finds that the draft decision must impose upon the defendant the immediate erasure 

of all personal data unlawfully collected so far. The Litigation Chamber has addressed this 

RRO in its revised draft decision63. 

280.  In addition to the two RROs, the Litigation Chamber received comments from other CSAs 

regarding  the  joint-controllership  established  by  the  Litigation  Chamber,  the  use  of 

legitimate interest for certain processing operations, the scope of the corrective measures, 

 

 

62 See para. 504 to 506. 
63 See para. 535. 

59 

as well as the administrative fine envisaged and the relationship between IAB Inc. and IAB 

Europe. 

281.  On 13 January 2022, the Litigation Chamber submitted its revised draft decision with the 

other concerned European supervisory authorities (hereinafter, ‘CSAs’), as foreseen under 

article 60.5 GDPR. 

282.  On 17 January 2022, the Litigation Chamber notified the parties of the  submission of the 

revised draft decision and the deadline of 27 January 2022 for the CSAs. It also clarified that 

the written exchanges with the defendant’s councils, concerning the sanction form, did not 

involve new arguments that would require reopening the debates with both parties. Hence, 

and seeing as both these exchanges and the sanction form will be part of the administrative 

file,  the  Litigation  Chamber  dismissed  the  complainants  request  to  gain  access  to  the 

sanction form and the written exchanges that followed with the defendant. 

283.  On 20 January 2022, the Litigation Chamber received a letter from the claimants, in which 

they claim that they have the right to obtain a copy of the sanction form and the subsequent 

exchanges  with  the  defendant,  in  order  to  verify  themselves  whether  no  new  elements 

were  brought  up  by  the  latter.  The  claimants  also  argue  that  if  the  sanction  form  and 

subsequent exchanges will be part of the administrative file, and thus accessible in case of 

an appeal,  there is no reason why they should  not  be granted  access  during the current 

proceedings. The claimants further claim, based on a press release by the defendant dd. 5 

November  2021,  that  the  Litigation  Chamber  has  agreed  to  approve  a  Code  of  Conduct 

submitted by the defendant 6 months after its decision. The claimants argue this has not 

been subject to the debates during the proceedings, and thus request access to all written 

exchanges with the defendant following the sanction form, as well as the reopening of the 

debates on the Litigation Chamber’s competence to approve a code of conduct or validate 

an action plan. 

284.  On 27 January 2022, the Litigation Chamber acknowledged the reception of the claimant’s 

letter,  and  responded  that  their  arguments  will  be  taken  into  consideration  in  its 

deliberations. 

Assessment by the Litigation Chamber 

285.  The Litigation Chamber first and foremost finds that it is not responsible and cannot be held 

accountable for public statements made outside of the proceedings by either or both of the 

parties involved during the Litigation Chamber’s deliberations on the merits.  

60 

286.  Secondly,  the  Market  Court  has  stated  that  the  claimants  do  not  have  any  say  in  the 

determination of the sanctions imposed by the Litigation Chamber64. In this regard, Article 

58.2.d of the GDPR grants supervisory authorities to  order a controller or a processor to 

bring  processing  operations  into  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  GDPR,  where 

appropriate,  in  a  specified  manner  and  within  a  specified  period.  This  provision,  read  in 

conjunction with Article 100, §1, 9° of the Data Protection Act, must be interpreted in the 

sense that an action plan and the inherently involved monitoring of this action plan by the 

BE  DPA,  must  be  seen  as  one  of  the  sanctions  that  can  be  imposed  on  a  controller  or 

processor. The action plan must therefore be seen as a corrective measures, with regard to 

which the claimants have no stake.   

287.  With regard to the defendant’s request not to publish the decision, the Litigation Chamber 

reminds of the significant impact of the case, in view of the a large number of data subjects 

and organisations involved. Moreover, the Litigation Chamber notes that the request by the 

defendants was submitted after the closure of the debates, and that the defendant itself 

already published on the case on 5 November 2021. Having considered these elements, the 

Litigation Chamber considers not to give a positive reply to the defendant’s request dd. 21 

December  2021  not  to  publish  the  decision  or  issue  public  communications  about  the 

decision prior to the exhaustion of all appeals.  

 

 

 

 

64  Market  Court,  1  December  2021,  FOD  Financiën  v.  GBA,  nr.  2021/AR/1044,  para.  7.3.4:  “It  is  (certainly)  not  for  a 
complainant to interfere in any way with the expediency, let alone the extent of a sanction. The complaint only concerns 
(and can only concern) an alleged infringement in such a way that the decision taken by the Dispute Resolution Chamber of 
the GBA in relation to the complaint - and in which it possibly imposes a sanction on the person concerned - is never an ultra 
petita judgment from the point of view of the complaint.” 

61 

B. Reasoning 

B.1. – Processing of personal data in the context of the Transparency and Consent Framework 

288.  In this section, the Litigation Chamber examines the concept of personal data as well as the 

question  of  whether  personal  data  exists  within  the  context  of  the  Transparency  and 

Consent Framework, designed and managed by IAB Europe65 and is being processed66.     

289.  For a proper understanding of this decision, the Litigation Chamber emphasises that the 

complainants indicated in their written submissions that they wished to limit themselves to 

the alleged breaches of the GDPR in the processing of personal data "in the TCF per se"67. 

The  Litigation  Chamber  will  therefore  not  pass  judgment  in  this  section  on  processing 

responsibility with regard to the processing operations that take place in the context of the 

OpenRTB system.  

B.1.1. – Presence of personal data within the TCF   

290.  European  data  protection  law,  including  the  GDPR,  has  always  taken  a  broad  view  of 

personal data with the aim of ensuring a high level of data protection and safeguarding the 

fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. The broad interpretation of, inter alia, 

the concept of personal data and the notion of processing is a key element of the case law 

of  the  Court  of  Justice68.  The  principle  that  personal  data  does  not  only  relate  to  an 

identified, but also to an identifiable natural person was already established in 1981 by the 

Council of Europe Convention for the  Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic 

Processing of Personal Data69.  

291.  The  GDPR  unambiguously  states  that  any  information  about  an  identified  or  identifiable 

natural person ("data subject") constitutes personal data. "Identifiable' should therefore be 

understood to mean the possibility of identifying a natural person directly or indirectly by 

means of  an identifier such  as a name,  an identification number, location data, an online 

identifier  or  one  or  more  factors  specific  to  the  physical,  physiological,  genetic,  mental, 

economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person70. 

292.  Furthermore, the GDPR provides that, to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, 

account should be taken of all means of which it can be reasonably assumed they will be

used  either  by  the  data  controller  or  by  any  other  person  to  identify  the  natural  person 

directly or indirectly, such as singling out71.  

293.  To determine whether resources can reasonably  be expected to  be used  to identify  the 

natural person, account should also be taken of all objective factors, such as the cost and 

time required for identification, taking into account the technology available at the time of 

processing and technological developments72. 

294.  Recital 30 GDPR clarifies that natural persons may be linked to online identifiers through 

their  devices, applications, tools and protocols, such  as Internet  Protocol  (IP) addresses, 

identification cookies or other identifiers. This may leave traces which, in particular when 

combined  with  unique  identifiers  and  other  information  received  by  the  servers,  may  be 

used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.  

295.  The  former  Article  29  Working  Party  has  already  addressed  the  importance  of  a  broad 

definition of personal data, in particular that a natural person can be considered identifiable 

when  he/she  can  be  distinguished  from  other  members  of  the  group  and  consequently 

treated differently 73. 

296.  This position is also taken by the Court of Justice. It is established case law that the content 

of the information that qualifies as personal data is not important74 and that the criterion of 

identifiability  must  be  interpreted  flexibly.  As  long  as  information,  due  to  its  content, 

purpose or effect, can be linked to an identified or identifiable natural person by means 

that  can  reasonably  be  used75,  regardless  of  whether  the  information  from  which  the 

data subject can be identified is held entirely by the same controller or partly by another 

entity, this information should be considered personal data76.  

297.  The  complainants  argue  in  their  submission  in  response  that  the  TC  String  is  a  unique 

character string which is also written into a cookie as a unique identifier and is then stored 

on a user's device77. Furthermore, the complainants take the view that IAB Europe collects

additional  information  about  users  with  the  help  of  the  TC  String,  including  sensitive 

personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR78. 

298.  The defendant, on the other hand, refutes the allegations and states that the TC String does 

not contain any personal data79 or any information directly or indirectly related to the so-

called 'content taxonomy'80, which IAB Europe uses as a 'common language' to describe the 

content of a website81. Furthermore, the defendant takes the view that the TC String does 

not constitute a unique identifier, nor is it conceived for that purpose82. 

299.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the defendant states that it must necessarily be possible to 

link the TC String with a user, but with the proviso that the link between the preferences 

conceived in the TC String and the user will be established only at a later stage, in particular 

in the context of the OpenRTB, and is therefore not covered by the Transparency & Consent 

Framework83. 

300.  Based on the technical documentation of IAB Europe and IAB Tech Lab on the TCF protocol, 

the Inspection Service concludes that the TC String in itself does not directly identify users 

or  devices,  as  the  components  that  compose  the  TC  String  merely  reflect  technical 

information, namely whether or not an unidentified user has consented to purposes Y or Z, 

and  whether  adtech  vendors  A  and  B  may  process  the  personal  data  for  the  accepted 

purposes.  

301.  Specifically, a TC String consists of the following fields:  

i.

vii. 

general metadata;  

a binary value for each of the purposes of the processing for which consent may be

interest;  

a  binary  value  for  each  of  the  adtech  vendors  who  may  collect  and  process  the 
user's personal data on the basis of his consent;  

a  binary  value  for  each  of  the  adtech  vendors  who  may  collect  and  process  the 
user's personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest;  

any processing restrictions;

Assessment by the Litigation Chamber 

302.  While the Litigation Chamber understands that it is not conclusively established that the 

TC String,  due  to  the  limited  metadata  and  values  it  contains,  in  itself  allows  for  direct 

identification of the user, the  Litigation Chamber notes that when the consent pop-up is 

accessed by script from a server managed by the CMP84, it inevitably also processes the 

user's IP address, which is explicitly classified as personal data under the GDPR.  

303.  Indeed,  Recital  30  GDPR  states  that  natural  persons  may  be  linked  to  online  identifiers 

through  their  devices,  applications,  tools  and  protocols,  such  as  Internet  Protocol  (IP) 

addresses, identification cookies or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification 

tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and 

other information received by the servers,  may be  used  to  create profiles of the  natural 

persons and identify them. 

304.  As soon as a CMP stores or reads the TC String on a user's device using a  euconsent-v2 

cookie, the consent or objection to the processing on the grounds of legitimate interest, as 

well as the preferences of this user, can be linked to the IP address of the user's device. In 

other words, CMPs have the technical means to collect IP addresses (as indicated in their 

pop-up85) and to combine all information relating to an identifiable person. The possibility of 

combining  the  TC  String  and  the  IP  address  means  that  this  is  information  about  an 

identifiable user86. 

305.  In addition, identification of the user is possible by linking to other data that can be used by 

participating organisations within TCF, but also in the context of OpenRTB. In that regard, 

the Litigation Chamber emphasises that the parties in question are not one and the same, 

but participating organisations — CMPs and adtech vendors — who, as examined in more 

detail  below87  are  obliged  to  disclose  information  enabling  them  to  identify  users  to  the 

defendant, upon simple request.

and/or  Controllers?",  in  Privacy  Technologies  and  Policy,  APF  2021,  LNCS,  vol  12703,  Springer,  2021,  pp.  50-51.  The 
Litigation Chamber notes in this regard that, until this summer, if a ‘globally stored’ TC String was chosen, the CMPs could 
access the IAB Europe-managed consensu.org internet domain to verify whether a globally scoped consent had been given 
by the user, which involved the disclosure of the TC String values coupled with users’ IP addresses to the CMPs, by IAB 
Europe. The defendant announced during the hearing that the globally scoped consents functionality would be deprecated. 
87 See para. 358 et seq. of this decision. 

65 

306.  Therefore,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  the  defendant  has  reasonable  means  at  its 

disposal that it can use with respect to registered organisations participating in the TCF, 

and  with  which  the  defendant  is  able  to  identify  directly  or  indirectly  the  user  behind  a 

TC String. 

307.  The  Litigation  Chamber  also  understands  that  the  TCF  is  intended  to  and  therefore 

inherently involves storing each user's combination of preferences in the form of a unique 

string in the TC String, in order to communicate those preferences to a large number of 

adtech vendors.  

308.  Indeed, the Litigation Chamber found from the inspection reports that adtech vendors as 

well as other participants within the wider OpenRTB ecosystem read the signal stored in a 

TC String  in order to  determine whether they have the required  legal  basis to  process a 

user's personal data for the purposes to which the user has consented88.  

309.  In  this  regard,  the  Litigation  Chamber  emphasises  that  it  is  sufficient  that  certain 

information is used to single out a natural person to be able to speak of personal data89. Also, 

the purpose of the TC String, namely to capture the preferences of a specific user, leads de 

facto to the TC String being regarded as personal data.  

310.  In other words, if the purpose of the processing is the singling out of persons, it may be 

assumed that the controller or another party has or will have at their disposal the means 

by which the data subject may reasonably be expected to be identified. To claim that 

individuals  are  not  identifiable,  when  the  purpose  of  the  processing  is  precisely  to 

identify them, would be a contradiction in terminis90. 

311.  Furthermore,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  processing  of  these 

preferences  has  unmistakable  consequences  for  the  rights  and  interests  of  the  data 

subjects, since these choices determine, among other things, which third parties will receive 

and process the personal data of the users in the context of the OpenRTB protocol91.  

312. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing  findings  as  well  as  the  broad  interpretation  of  the  concept  of 

personal data, as confirmed in the case law of the Court of Justice92, the Litigation Chamber 

concludes that the preferences of users in a TC String do constitute personal data, as these 

preferences relate to a singled out, identifiable natural person93.

B.1.2. - Processing of personal data within the TCF   

313.  The  Inspection  Service  explains  in  its  technical  investigation  reports  that  the  TCF  is 

necessarily based on three core components:  

i. 

a  fully  customisable  user 

interface  that  allows  TCF-registered  Consent 

Management Platforms to collect the user's consent, any objections to processing 

based  on  a  legitimate  interest,  and  preferences  regarding  the  purposes  of 

processing and authorised adtech vendors;  

ii. 

a Global Vendors List that includes partners approved by IAB Europe and specific 

information regarding their respective processing purposes and legal bases; and  

iii. 

a  standardised  mechanism  for  requesting,  storing  and  optionally  sharing 

authorised  adtech  vendors,  consents,  objections  and  preferences  through  a 

dedicated API, a standard format for storing partners/consents, and a standardised 

data structure for transferring partner/consent status94. 

314.  The complainants argue that the generation of the TC String corresponds to the automated 

creation of a unique string of characters associated with a specific user, through which his 

data exchange preferences are captured by the  intervention of a CMP connected to the 

TCF95.  

315.  Furthermore, the complainants refer to the sharing of the TC String with CMPs and other 

participants in the TCF. Specifically, they argue that the storage of a TC String in a specific 

euconsent-v2  cookie,  on  a  storage  system  chosen  by  the  CMP  or  associated  with  the 

consensu.org internet domain managed by IAB Europe, also constitutes processing of user 

preferences. 

316.  The defendant, on the other hand, argues that there is no processing of personal data within 

the meaning of Section 4(2) GDPR in the context of the TCF, given its view that the TC String 

as such cannot be regarded as personal data. 

Assessment by the Litigation Chamber 

317.  First and foremost, the Litigation Chamber refers to the definition of processing personal 

data as being any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data or 

sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, 

organisation,  structuring,  storage,  adaptation  or  alteration,  retrieval,  consultation,  use,

Service, 6 January 2020 (Exhibit 53), pp. 58-59. 
95 Submissions of the complainants dd. 18 February 2021, para. 27. 

67 

disclosure  by  transmission,  dissemination  or  otherwise  making  available,  alignment  or 

combination, blocking, erasure or destruction96.  

318.  The TCF provides a standardised approach for collecting and exchanging personal data - i.e. 

consent, any objections, and preferences - from well-defined, already identified or at least 

identifiable  users  in  a  supposedly  GDPR-compliant  manner.  The  fact  that  participating 

organisations can directly identify data subjects with additional data such as an IP address 

from the TC String, which captures these consents, objections and preferences, means not 

only that the TC String can be considered personal data97, but also that the participating 

organisations (adtech vendors) necessarily process personal data. 

319.  Taking  into  account  the  connection  between  the  TCF  and  the  OpenRTB  protocol,  the 

Litigation Chamber refers to the guidelines of the former Article 29 Working Party on Online 

Advertising, in which the Working Party noted that the methods of  advertising based on 

surfing behaviour inherently involve the processing of personal data, as such advertising 

entails the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers, so that data 

subjects can be followed online even if their real names are not known98.  

320.  The  Litigation  Chamber  understands  that  the  Transparency  and  Consent  Framework 

inherently  entails  the  collection,  processing,  storage  and  subsequent  sharing  of  users' 

preferences with other parties, whether or not in combination with additional personal data 

in the context of the OpenRTB.  

321.  Consequently, the Litigation Chamber finds that there is in fact processing of personal data 

within  the  meaning  of  Article  4.2  of  the  GDPR.  This  conclusion  is  also  confirmed  by 

consideration of the possibility that the TC Strings may at any time be linked to immediately 

identifiable information, whether provided by the data subject or not. 

 

B.2. - Responsibility of IAB Europe for the processing operations within the Transparency and 
Consent Framework  

322.  IAB Europe states that it is neither data controller nor jointly  responsible for the processing 

of personal data collected by the participating organisations in the context of the TCF.  

323.  However, the Litigation Chamber finds that this reasoning cannot be followed for several 

reasons. First of all, the broad interpretation by the Court of Justice of the concept of a data 

controller  (B.2.1.  -  Broad  interpretation  of  the  concept  of  data  controller  by  the  Court  of 

 

 

96 Art. 4.2) GDPR. 
97 See previous section, B.1.1. – Presence of personal data within the TCF.

29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp171_nl.pdf

Justice and the EDPB) must be applied. The fact that IAB Europe has a decisive influence on 

the purpose (B.2.2. - Determining the purposes of the processing of personal data within the 

TCF) and means (B.2.3. - Determining the means for processing personal data within a TCF) 

of  the  processing  by  imposing  compulsory  TCF  parameters  also  needs  to  be  taken  into 

account. 

B.2.1. - Broad interpretation of the concept of data controller by the Court of Justice and the 

EDPB 

324.  The  GDPR  defines  a  "data  controller"  as  the  entity  that,  alone  or  jointly  with  others, 

determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data99. This definition 

should  be  understood  in  the  light  of  the  legislator's  objective  of  placing  the  main 

responsibility  for  the  protection  of  personal  data  on  the  entity  that  actually  exercises 

control over the data processing. This means that not only the legal qualification, but also 

the actual reality100must be taken into account. 

325.  The EDPB has clarified that the concept of data controller refers to the influence of the data 

controller on the processing, based on a power of decision or monitoring of the processing 

activities. Such monitoring may be based on legal provisions, on an implicit power or on the 

exercise of a de  facto  influence101.  In essence,  determining  the purposes and  the  means 

corresponds to deciding respectively the "why" and the "how" of the processing: given a 

particular processing operation, the controller is the actor who exerts such influence over 

the processing of personal data, thus determining why the processing is taking place (i.e., 

“to what end”; or “what for”) and how this objective shall be attained (i.e. which means shall 

be employed to pursue the objective)102. 

326.  The power to determine the means and purposes of processing activities may first be linked 

to the functional role of an organisation103. The responsibility may also be assigned on the 

basis of the contractual  provisions between the  parties  involved, although these are not 

always decisive104, or on the basis of an assessment of the actual control of a party.  For 

example, determining the means and purposes may result from a decisive influence on the 

processing, in particular on why processing is carried out in a certain manner105.

327.  In its Jehovah's Witnesses judgment106, the Court of Justice gives a broad interpretation to 

the concept of a data controller. This judgment is relevant and applicable to the present 

case, as it clarifies that the definition of data controller must be interpreted broadly, in order 

to ensure 'effective and complete protection of the data subjects'107, and that no access to 

the  personal  data  concerned  is  required  in  order  to  qualify  as  a  data  controller108.  The 

Litigation Chamber quotes the relevant recitals of the aforementioned judgment below: 

“65. As Article 2(d) of Directive 95/46 expressly provides, the term 'data controller' refers to 

the natural or legal person who, 'alone or jointly with others', determines the purposes and 
means of the processing of personal data. This concept does not therefore necessarily refer 

to a single natural or legal person and may involve several participants in such processing, 
each of whom is then subject to data protection provisions (see, to that effect, Judgment of 
5 June 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, point 29). 

66. Although the aim of that provision is to ensure effective and complete protection of data 

subjects  through  a  broad  definition  of  the  term  'data  controller',  the  existence  of  joint 
responsibility does not necessarily mean that the various participants in the processing of 
personal data are equally responsible. On the contrary, these participants may be involved in 

this processing at different stages and to different degrees, so that the assessment of the 
level of responsibility of each of them must take into account all the relevant circumstances 
of the particular case (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie 

Schleswig-Holstein, C- -210/16, EU:C:2018:388, points 28, 43 and 44). 

67.  In  that  regard,  neither  the  wording  of  Article  2(d)  of  Directive  95/46,  nor  any  other 
provision  of  that  directive,  permits  the  conclusion  that  the  purposes  and  means  of  the 

processing must be determined by means of written guidelines or instructions from the data 
controller. 

68.  However,  a  natural  or  legal  person  who  exercises  influence  over  the  processing  of 
personal data for reasons of their own and thereby takes part in determining the purposes 

and means of processing may be regarded as a data controller within the meaning of Article 
2(d) of Directive 95/46. 

69.  Moreover,  the  fact  that  several  participants  are  responsible  for  the  same  processing 
under that provision does not presuppose that each of them has access to the personal data 

concerned (see, to that effect, Judgment of 5 June 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-
Holstein, C- -210/16, EU:C:2018:388, point 38)."

328.  It is therefore clear to the Litigation Chamber that the defendant does not necessarily have 

to process the personal data concerned itself, nor does it have to be able to grant itself any 

access to the personal data, in order for IAB Europe to be considered a data controller, as109 

in  relation  to  a  framework  for  which  the  defendant  moreover  charges  an  annual  fee  of 

1.200 EUR to participating organisations110. 

329.  Furthermore, the impact or consequences of certain activities on the rights and freedoms 

of  data  subjects  may  also  be  taken  into  account  when  determining  an  organisation's 

responsibility. If it appears that an organisation plays a decisive role in the dissemination of 

personal  data111  or  that the  processing  operations carried  out under the influence of  the 

organisation  may  substantially  affect  the  fundamental  rights  to  privacy  and  to  the 

protection of personal data112, that organisation should be regarded as a data controller. 

330.  In this case, the Litigation Chamber concludes that the participating parties, i.e. publishers 

and adtech vendors, would not be able to achieve the goals set by IAB Europe without the 

TCF.  IAB  Europe's  framework  thus  plays  a  decisive  role  with  regard  to  the  collection, 

processing and dissemination of users' preferences, consents and objections, regardless of 

whether the defendant itself comes into contact with the aforementioned data.  

B.2.2. - Determining the purposes of the processing of personal data within the TCF 

331.  Defining the purposes is the first condition for identifying the data controller of personal 

data113.  Moreover,  it  is  generally  considered  that  defining  the  purposes  of  processing 

outweighs  defining  the  means  when  it  comes  to  establishing  the  responsibility  of  an 

organisation114.  Incidentally,  an  erroneous  designation  by  a  data  controller,  such  as  a 

designation as a processor that is contradicted by the factual situation, is not binding on the 

court or supervisory authority115.

332.  The Inspection Service states that the Transparency and Consent Framework does not in 

itself constitute processing of personal data, but is a set of policy documents and technical 

specifications  developed  by  IAB  Europe  and  IAB  Tech  Lab116.  The  Litigation  Chamber 

concurs with this statement by the Inspection Service. 

333.  However, the Litigation Chamber also found that personal data are processed in the context 

of the TCF, and more specifically the processing of user preferences, which CMPs record 

via a user interface and store using the TC String. To enable a standardised approach within 

the TCF, IAB Europe uses both policy documents and technical specifications:  

▪  The TCF Policies consist of rules for participation that apply to publishers, Consent 

Management Providers (CMPs) and other adtech vendors. 

▪  The  technical  specifications  of  the  TCF,  which  provide  a  technical  protocol  with 

which  participating  organisations  can  immediately  exchange  the  status  of  the 

information  provided  and  the  choices  of  the  data  subjects.  These  technical 

specifications  are  closely  aligned  with  the  TCF  Policies,  in  order  to  provide  the 

technical functionality needed to operationalise the TCF standard. 

334.  The defendant states in its defence that the processing of those preferences, in accordance 

with the rules imposed by the TCF on participating organisations, pursues the objective of 

enabling  both  website  and  app  publishers  and  the  advertising  technology  partners  who 

support  the  targeting,  delivery  and  measurement  of  advertising  and  content  (adtech 

vendors) to obtain users’ consent, to transparently disclose their processing purposes, and 

to establish a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data in order to provide digital 

advertising, among others117. This objective is also reflected in the IAB Europe Transparency 

& Consent Framework Policies (hereinafter "TCF Policies")118: 

“ii.  The  goal  of  the  Framework  is  to  help  players  in  the  online  ecosystem  meet  certain 

requirements  of  the  ePrivacy  Directive  (and  by  extension  its  successor,  the  upcoming 

ePrivacy  Regulation),    and  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  by  providing  a  way  of 
informing users about inter alia the storing and/or accessing of information on their devices, 
the fact that their personal data is processed, the purposes for which their personal data is 

processed,  the  companies  that  are  seeking  to  process  their  personal  data  for  these 
purposes, providing users with choice about the same, and signalling to third parties inter alia 
which information has been disclosed to users and what users’ choices are.”

118  IAB  Europe  Transparency  &  Consent  Framework  Policies  v2019-08-21.3  (Exhibit  32);  IAB  Europe  Transparency  & 
Consent Framework Policies v2019-04-02.2c (Exhibit 38). 

72 

335.  It is also apparent from the documentation drawn up by the defendant that the purposes of 

the TC String are determined by IAB Europe:  

“A TC String's primary purpose is to encapsulate and encode all the information disclosed to 

a user and the expression of their preferences for their personal data processing under the 
GDPR. Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP), the information is captured into an 

encoded  and  compact  HTTP-transferable  string.  This  string  enables  communication  of 
transparency  and  consent  information  to  entities,  or  "vendors",  that  process  a  user's 
personal data. Vendors decode a TC String to determine whether they have the necessary 
legal bases to process a user's personal data for their purposes." 119 

336.  Although the Litigation Chamber emphasises that the purpose of the processing of the TC 

String must be distinguished from the purposes of the processing that takes place outside 

the TCF, such as the processing and exchange of the personal data that are part of a  bid 

request in the context of OpenRTB, it finds that the TCF is offered with the aim of indirectly 

promoting  the use of  OpenRTB. In that respect, IAB Europe,  in its capacity as  Managing 

Organisation,  acts  as  a  hinge  between  TCF  and  OpenRTB,  which,  incidentally,  was 

developed by IAB Tech Lab.  

337.  In  support  of  its  standpoint,  the  Litigation  Chamber  refers  to  the  inventory  of  possible 

purposes that participating  organisations may pursue within the context of the TCF. For 

example,  the  TCF  Policies  for  CMPs,  publishers  and  other  adtech  vendors  respectively 

stipulate  a  mandatory  list120  with  fixed  and  predefined  Purposes121,  Special  purposes122, 

Features123 and Special features defined by IAB Europe: 

▪  Purpose 1 — Store and/or access information on a device 

▪  Purpose 2 — Select basic ads 

▪  Purpose 3 — Create a personalised ads profile 

▪  Purpose 4 — Select personalised ads 

▪  Purpose 5 — Create a personalised content profile 

▪  Purpose 6 — Select personalised content 

▪  Purpose 7 — Measure ad performance

120 IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework Policies v2019-08-21.3 (Exhibit 32), pp. 26 ff. 
121  The  term  “Purpose”  refers  to  one  of  the  defined  purposes  for  processing  of  data,  including  users’  personal  data,  by 
participants in the Framework that are defined in the TCF Policies or the Specifications. 
122  “Special  Purpose”  means  one  of  the  defined  purposes  for  processing  of  data,  including  users’  personal  data,  by 
participants in the Framework that are defined in the TCF Policies or the Specifications for which Vendors declare a Legal 
Basis in the GVL and for which the user is not given choice by a CMP. 
123 “Feature” means one of the features of processing personal data used by participants in the Framework that are defined 
in the TCF Policies or the Specifications used in pursuit of one or several Purposes for which the user is not given choice 
separately to the choice afforded regarding the Purposes for which they are used. 

73 

▪  Purpose 8 — Measure content performance 

▪  Purpose 9 — Apply market research to generate audience insights 

▪  Purpose 10 — Develop and improve products 

▪  Special Purpose 1 — Ensure security, prevent fraud, and debug 

▪  Special Purpose 2 — Technically deliver ads or content 

▪  Feature 1 — Match and combine offline data sources 

▪  Feature 2 — Link different devices 

▪  Feature  3  —  Receive  and  use  automatically-sent  device  characteristics  for 

identification 

▪  Special Feature 1 — Use precise geolocation data 

▪  Special Feature 2 — Actively scan device characteristics for identification 

338.  The Litigation Chamber concludes from this that the purpose of the TC String, and in the 

broader sense of the processing of the TC String within the TCF as translated into the TCF 

Policies, has been established by IAB Europe. 

B.2.3. - Determining the means for processing personal data within a TCF 

339.  Determining  the  means  of  processing  is  the  second  cornerstone  of  the  concept  of 

controllership.  With  regard  to  the  means  of  processing,  the  EDPB  makes  a  distinction 

between  so-called  “essential”  and  “non-essential”  means.  The  choice  of  non-essential 

means may, in principle, be left to a processor without any reduction in the responsibility of 

the entity that determined the purposes124.  

340.  "Essential means" are closely linked to the purpose and scope of the processing and are 

inherently  reserved  to  the  controller.  Examples  of  essential  means  relate  to  the  type  of 

personal data processed ("what data are processed?"), the duration of the processing ("how 

long are they processed?"), the categories of recipients ("who has access to them?") and 

the  categories  of  data  subjects  ("whose  personal  data  are  processed?").  "Non-essential 

means",  on  the  other  hand,  mainly  concern  the  practical  aspects  of  the  implementation, 

such  as  the  choice  of  a  particular  type  of  hardware  or  software  or  the  detailed  security 

measures that can be left to the processor to decide125. 

341. 

It is established by the Litigation Chamber, and also confirmed by the defendant126, that the 

Transparency  and  Consent  Framework  constitutes  a  framework  of  binding  rules  for  the 

participating organisations with regard to the processing of user preferences. Participants

in  the  TCF  are  assumed  to  accept  the  Terms  and  Conditions  for  the  IAB  Europe 

Transparency  &  Consent  Framework  (hereinafter  "Terms  and  Conditions")127  in  order  to 

register. By doing so, the Litigation Chamber finds that IAB Europe does not only monitor 

compliance with the TCF specifications and policies, as Managing Organisation. In addition, 

the defendant is also defining the rules applicable to the processing of TC Strings under the 

TCF, as well as imposing these rules on participating organisations.  

342.  In  the  following  paragraphs,  the  Litigation  Chamber  will  examine  the  extent  to  which 

essential means of processing the TC String are actually determined by IAB Europe. 

343.  Generation, modification and reading of the TC String – In the first place, the TCF Technical 

Specifications128, the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework Implementation 

Guidelines (hereinafter "TCF Implementation Guidelines")129 and the TCF Policies130 explain 

how CMPs can collect user approval, must generate a unique TC String, and need to store 

the value of the TC String.  

344.  Moreover, CMPs are obliged to register with IAB Europe in order to be able to generate a 

TC  String131  and  must  follow  the  technical  specifications  developed  by  IAB  Europe  in 

cooperation with IAB Tech Lab regarding the API132 with which CMPs can generate the TC 

String and adtech vendors and publishers can read it133. These specifications also show that 

the CMP API plays an essential role in the TCF, as it provides a standardised way for parties, 

such as the publisher or an advertising vendor, to access the users' preferences, which are 

managed by the CMP134. The Litigation Chamber notes that the use of this API is mandatory 

when communicating between CMPs and adtech vendors. 

345.  With regard to the content of the TC String, the TCF Technical Specifications specify which 

information  is  included,  including  metadata  such  as  the  exact  time  the  TC  String  was 

generated or modified. 

346.  In this regard, the Litigation Chamber refers to the Wirtschaftsakademie judgment, in which 

the Court of Justice held that the entity responsible for laying down, and a fortiori imposing, 

settings in relation to a data processing operation, thereby participates in determining the

132 An API is a programming interface that allows you to "plug in" to an application to exchange data. An API is open and 
offered  by  the  program  owner.  APIs  are  used  in  various  fields  of  digital  marketing  to  enable,  for  example,  automated 
gateways for data exchange between programs such as Adwords, AdExchange and an agency or vendor. It can also be used 
by adtech vendors, agencies or software suppliers to automate advertising campaigns.

purposes  and  means  of  that  processing  and  must  therefore  be  regarded  as  the  data 

controller135. 

347.  Storage  location  -  In  their  written  evidence,  the  complainants  argue  that  IAB  Europe  is 

responsible  for  managing  the  internet  domain  "consensu.org",  to  which  the  so-called 

globally  scoped  consent  cookies136  refer  and  which  as  such  allows  CMPs  to  consult  and 

modify the TC Strings shared across multiple websites or applications.  

348.  In  contrast,  IAB  Europe  states  in  its  submissions  that  although  it  has  registered  the 

consensu.org domain, there is no storage of the TC String on IAB Europe's servers to which 

that  consensu.org  domain  refers.  Indeed,  IAB  Europe  delegates  a  subdomain  of 

consensu.org to each registered CMP137, which stores the TC String on the user's device 

using a euconsent-v2 cookie and associates it with the consensu.org domain. According to 

the defendant, it is therefore only the CMP that generates and stores the TC String and the 

CMP's own servers that read out the TC String. 

349.  In order to establish the responsibility of IAB Europe for the processing of the TC Strings, it 

is necessary to determine to what extent the delegation of a sub-domain to a CMP by IAB 

Europe implies that the defendant establishes at least the means (and any purposes) of such 

processing. 

350.  The TCF Technical Specifications prescribe that sharing the TC String with CMPs should 

take place in two ways: either by storing the TC String in a storage system chosen by the 

CMP, if it is a service-specific consent138; or by storing the TC String in a shared  globally 

scoped consent cookie associated with the IAB Europe's consensu.org internet domain139.  

351.  Based  on  the  technical  reports  and  the  statements  of  the  parties  at  the  hearing,  the 

Litigation  Chamber  concludes  that  a  service-specific  consent  by  means  of  a  first-party 

euconsent-v2 cookie has been established, and is therefore stored exclusively on the user's 

device. In this first scenario, the euconsent-v2 cookie in question will therefore not be linked 

to the consensu.org domain, nor to the subdomain delegated to the CMP by IAB Europe.  

352.  However, in exceptional cases where the user's consent also applies to other websites, so-

called globally scoped consent cookies, CMPs are required to store the relevant TC String

Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH, C-210/16, ECLI: EU:C:2017:796, paragraph 39: "In these circumstances, it 
must  be  judged  that  the  administrator  of  a  fan  page  on  Facebook,  such  as  Wirtschaftsakademie,  by  defining  settings 
according to, in particular, its target audience and objectives for the management or promotion of its activities, participates 
in determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data of visitors to its fan page". 
136 Which contain the TC Strings. 
137 More specifically, it concerns the subdomain <name of the CMP>.mgr.consensu.org. For example, for Onetrust this is 
https://cookies.onetrust.mgr.consensu.org/.   
138 In concrete terms, this means that the user's consent is only valid for the website visited, and for the purposes accepted 
and the adtech vendors approved.

on the user's device by means of a third-party cookie, whereby the cookie is associated with 

the  consensu.org  domain140.  Only  the  CMPs  are  able  to  read  the  TC  Strings  on  the  user 

devices.  

353.  In this second scenario, each CMP is then given a separate sub-domain, assigned by IAB 

Europe via DNS delegation, where the consent cookie with the TC String is associated with 

the main domain consensu.org and its sub-domains. In concrete terms, this means that the 

scope of the globally scoped consent cookie includes both the domain consensu.org and 

the subdomains delegated to the CMPs.  

354.  According  to  the  defendant,  the  globally  scoped  consent  was  only  applied  to  a  limited 

extent  and  IAB  Europe  stopped  using  and  supporting  it  after  the  hearing.  The  Litigation 

Chamber takes note of this, but emphasises that this functionality also indicates that IAB 

Europe’s responsibility  goes beyond merely designing a framework. 

355.  The  Litigation  Chamber  also  considers  that  the  defendant  establishes  the  means  of 

processing the TC String as well as the euconsent-v2 cookie, both for the service-specific 

and  for  the  globally-scoped  consents.  The  fact  that  the  TCF  does  not  impose  a  specific 

mechanism for storing users' consent in the browser but merely recommends that CMPs 

use a first-party cookie does not preclude the finding that the defendant provides a list of 

possible mechanisms for linking the TC String to an individual user, of which the CMP API is 

the  most  common.  More  specifically,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that,  in  its  policy 

document entitled 'Consent Management Platform API', the defendant prescribes, among 

other  things,  the  standardised  way  in  which  the  various  parties  involved  in  the  TCF  can 

consult the preferences, objections and consents of users141: 

 

 

140 Technical Analysis Report of the Inspection Service, 6 January 2020 (Exhibit 53), p. 79. 
141 Consent Management Platform API v2.0, August 2019 (Exhibit 34), p. 6. 

 

77 

356.  Categories  of  recipients  of  the  TC  String  -  The  Litigation  Chamber  also  rules  that  IAB 

Europe determines with whom the users' preferences are to be shared, by, among other 

things, providing a list of TCF-registered adtech vendors, the so-called Global Vendors List 

(GVL)142, as well as a list of permitted CMPs (Global CMP List)143.  

357.  IAB Europe's documentation shows that publishers who wish to use the TCF are obliged to 

work with a TCF-registered CMP144. In addition, the TCF Implementation Guidelines state 

that CMPs are obliged to collect consent and any objections for all purposes and partners 

chosen by the publisher, although this may be extended to all adtech vendors included in 

the GVL145. 

358.  Retention period of the TC String - Finally, the two versions of the TCF Policies explicitly 

state that CMPs and participating adtech vendors must retain the record of the consent or 

objection, which is stored in the TC String, for as long as the processing is ongoing and make 

it  available  to  the  Managing  Organisation,  i.e.  the  defendant,  upon  the  latter’s  simple 

request146: 

“8. Record Keeping 

1.  A  CMP  will  maintain  records  of  consent,  as  required  under  the  Policies  and/or  the 
Specifications, and will provide the MO access to such records upon request without undue 

delay. 
2. A CMP will retain a record of the UI that has been deployed on any given Publisher at any 
given time and make this record available to its Publisher client, Vendors, and/or the MO upon 

request. 
[…] 
15. Record Keeping 

1.  A  Vendor  must  maintain  records  of  consent,  as  required  under  the  Policies  and  the 
Specifications, and will provide the MO access to such records upon request without undue 
delay. 

2. A Vendor must maintain records of user identification, timestamps, and received Signals 
for the full duration of the relevant processing. A Vendor may maintain such records of user 
identification, timestamps, and Signals beyond the duration of the processing as required to 

comply with legal obligations or to reasonably defend or pursue legal claims, and/or for other 
processing allowed by law, under a valid legal basis, and consistent with the purposes for 
which the data was collected.”

359.  The Litigation Chamber therefore finds that IAB Europe bears the responsibility for defining 

the criteria by which the retention periods of the TC Strings can be determined. 

360.  It  follows  from  the  foregoing  that,  in  addition  to  the  purposes,  IAB  Europe  does  in  fact 

determine  the  means  of  generating,  storing  and  sharing  the  TC  String  by  which  the 

preferences, objections and consent of users are processed. The following elements are 

decisive according to the Litigation Chamber:   

i. 

IAB  Europe  defines  how  CMPs  can  collect  consent  or  objections  from  users, 

generate a unique TC String, and store the value of the TC String; 

ii. 

IAB  Europe,  in  collaboration  with  IAB  Tech  Lab147,  has  developed  the  technical 

specifications of the API with which adtech vendors, among others, can access the 

preferences of the users, which are managed by the CMP, in a standardised way;  

iii. 

IAB Europe determines the storage location and method for both service-specific 

and globally scoped consent cookies;  

iv. 

IAB  Europe  manages  the  lists  of  registered  CMPs  and  adtech  vendors  and 

therefore  determines  with  which  possible  recipients  the  data  relating  to  the  TC 

String is communicated; 

v. 

IAB Europe determines the criteria by which the retention periods for TC Strings 

may  be  established  and  the  way  in  which  organisations  participating  in  the  TCF 

must  make  these  TC  Strings  available  to  the  Managing  Organisation,  i.e.  the 

defendant. 

361.  Based on the foregoing explanations, the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant must 

be considered as data controller for the personal  data processing with respect to the 

registration of the consent signal, objections and users' preferences by means of the TC 

String, in accordance with the policies and technical specifications of the Transparency 

& Consent Framework. 

B.3. - Joint controllership of publishers, CMPs and adtech vendors with regard to the means and 
purposes of the processing of personal data within the context of the TCF and of the OpenRTB 

362.  IAB  Europe's  responsibility  does  not  exclude  that  there  are  other  data  controllers 

implementing the TCF and relying on the OpenRTB protocol, that have their own or shared 

responsibility for the personal data processing operations they perform.  

 

 

147 IAB Europe worked with IAB Tech Lab to determine the policies for the framework's rules. IAB Europe has also entrusted 
Tech Lab with the development as well as the hosting of the technical implementations and specifications of the TCF, due 
to their technological expertise. 

79 

B.3.1. - Joint processing responsibility 

363.  Article 26.1  of the  GDPR  states that joint responsibility  exists when "two  or more jointly 

determine the purposes and means of the processing". The Court of Justice specified that 

'the existence of joint responsibility of the various actors does not necessarily mean that 

they  are  equally  responsible  for  one  and  the  same  processing  of  personal  data.  On  the 

contrary, those actors may be involved at different stages and to different degrees, so that 

the assessment of the level of responsibility of each of them must take account of all the 

relevant circumstances of the particular case'148. 

364.  Again, the EDPB further explained that the assessment of joint processing responsibility 

should  be  based  on  a  factual  rather  than  a  formal  analysis  of  the  actual  impact  on  the 

purposes and means of processing149.  

365.  First of all, the Litigation Chamber underlines that an identical decision does not necessarily 

have  to  exist  in  order  to  speak  of  joint  processing  responsibility;  it  is  sufficient  that  the 

defined purposes are complementary to each other150. The EDPB also emphasises that joint 

participation in the definition of the means and purposes may take the form of a common 

decision as well as result from different yet converging decisions of two or more entities 

regarding the purposes and essential means of a data processing operation151.  

366.  Decisions may be considered to be convergent if they are complementary and necessary 

for the processing in a way that confers a tangible influence on the determination of the 

purposes  and  means  of  processing.  The  question  to  be  asked  is  whether  the  intended 

processing  of  personal  data  would  be  impossible  without  the  participation  of  all  parties, 

more  specifically,  whether  the  processing  activities  carried  out  by  each  party  are 

inseparable and indivisible.  

367.  Both in its submissions and during the hearing, IAB Europe emphasised that the TCF and 

the OpenRTB system are completely independent from each other, in the sense that even 

without participation in the TCF, adtech vendors can freely process personal data within the 

context of the OpenRTB. On the other hand, the complainants have always referred to the

inherent interconnectedness between OpenRTB and the TCF, which the defendant itself 

would confirm - according to the complainants - in the TCF Implementation Guidelines152. 

368.  The Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant's argument cannot be followed, given that 

the defendant repeatedly states in its submissions, that the reason for the existence of the 

TCF is precisely to bring the processing of personal data based on the OpenRTB protocol, 

among others, into conformity with the applicable regulations, including the GDPR and the 

ePrivacy directive. Although the Litigation Chamber understands that the TCF may also be 

used by publishers for other applications153 , whether or not in collaboration with CMPs, it is 

equally  certain  that  the  TCF  was  never  intended  to  be  a  stand-alone,  independent 

ecosystem.  

369.  On  the  contrary,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  Transparency  and  Consent 

Framework includes policies and technical specifications that should enable website and 

application publishers (publishers) and adtech partners that support the targeting, delivery 

and measurement of  advertising  and content  (adtech vendors)  to  disclose  transparently 

their processing purposes, to establish a legal basis for the processing of personal data for 

the provision of digital advertising, and to obtain consent or identify objections of users154.   

370.  Thus, the Litigation Chamber finds that the decisions translated by IAB Europe into the 

provisions  of  the  TCF  policies  and  technical  specifications,  on  the  one  hand,    and  the 

means  and  purposes  determined  by  the  participating  organisations  in  relation  to  the 

processing - whether or not in the context of OpenRTB - of users' personal data, , on the 

other  hand,  must  be  regarded  as  convergent  decisions155.  IAB  Europe  provides  an 

ecosystem within which the consent, objections and preferences of users are collected 

and  exchanged  not  for  its  own  purposes  or  self-preservation,  but  to  facilitate  further 

processing by third parties (i.e. publishers and adtech vendors). 

371.  As a result, the Litigation Chamber finds that IAB Europe and the respective participating 

organisations should be considered as joint controllers for the collection and subsequent 

dissemination  of  users'  consent,  objections  and  preferences,  as  well  as  for  the  related 

processing  of  their  personal  data,  without  the  responsibility  of  participating  CMPs  and 

adtech vendors detracting from IAB Europe's responsibility.

measurement, etc.

a. Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) 

372.  The  CMPs  ensure  the  technical  implementation  of  consent  banners  through  which  data 

subjects indicate their choices regarding the processing of their personal data. 

373.  Specifically, CMPs have the function of storing users' consent, objections and preferences 

in the TC String, then storing the value in the form of a euconsent-v2 cookie in the browsers 

used to visit the website, and finally providing an API to  adtech vendors so that they can 

access the consent, objection and preference values for each individual user156. 

374.  CMPs that wish to register in the IAB Europe TCF v2.0 should implement the standardised 

processing  purposes  and  functionalities  in  their  user  interface  to  collect  and  store  the 

preferences of the data subject in this regard157. They must also comply with the applicable 

lawful principles, as set out in the IAB Europe TCF v2.0.  

375.  The Litigation Chamber has already established that the TC String in itself does not directly 

identify persons or devices. However, once the TC String is placed on the user's device, a 

CMP can assign a unique identifier to this TC String, i.e. the IP address of the device on which 

it is placed in the form of an euconsent-v2 cookie158. 

376.  To  provide  a  CMP  interface  to  users,  publishers  need  to  implement  the  CMP  JavaScript 

code  on  their  website.  This  code  is  then  loaded  directly  from  the  CMP  server  or  via  the 

delegated subdomain. As a result of this HTTP(S) request, both the publisher's server and 

the CMP's server gain access to the IP address of the user visiting the website and seeing 

the CMP interface159.   

377.  Access to that IP address allows CMPs to enrich the consent, objection and preferences 

contained  in  the  TC  String  with  other  information  already  in  their  possession  or  in  the 

possession of the publisher and linked to that same IP address. On this basis, the Litigation 

Chamber concludes that CMPs process a large number of personal data.  

378.  The Litigation Chamber  assesses the extent to  which the CMPs act as processors or as 

(joint) controllers in the following paragraphs.  

379.  According  to  the  defendant,  as  laid  down  in  its  TCF  Policies,  CMPs  are  in  principle 

considered  to  be  processors160.  The  Litigation  Chamber  disagrees  with  this  view  for  the 

following reasons. The CMPs' main task is to develop and provide interfaces that can have

a direct impact on the choice of the data subjects. The CMPs therefore play a key role, not 

only in the context of the TCF, but also with regard to the processing of personal data under 

the OpenRTB. They are therefore obliged to comply with the data protection principles laid 

down in Article 5.1 of the GDPR (lawfulness, fairness and transparency of the processing of 

personal data). 

380.  Although the TCF Policies prohibit CMPs from giving any preference to particular adtech 

vendors  on  the  Global  Vendors  List,  and  they  must  therefore  in  principle  present  all 

registered adtech vendors to users, unless otherwise provided by the publishers161, some 

authors  note  that  a  number  of  CMPs  do  not  comply  with  this  requirement.  This  is  done 

either by imposing pre-selected adtech vendors on the publishers or by denying them the 

possibility of deviating from the full list of adtech vendors by default162. 

381.  It is also worth noting that CMPs have a wide margin of appreciation regarding the interface 

they offer to users. After all, the TCF policies impose only minimum interface requirements 

on participating CMPs163, with the result that in practice the interfaces and compliance with 

the principles of fairness and transparency can vary greatly depending on which CMP the 

website and application publishers work with164. 

382.  The foregoing findings lead the Litigation Chamber to conclude that CMPs play a significant 

role and therefore bear (joint) responsibility165 with regard to the purposes and means of the 

processing of users' personal data within the TCF and the OpenRTB system.  

383.  The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that this conclusion does not mean that all CMPs 

must systematically be considered as joint-controllers together with IAB Europe and the 

website publishers, or that the scope of the joint-controllership is without boundaries. As 

explained earlier in this decision166, the list of CMPs implementing the TCF is limitative167 

due  to  the  mandatory  registration  and  approval  process  with  IAB  Europe,  as  Managing 

Organisation. The Litigation Chamber finds the joint controllership established in relation to,

iii. 

IAB Europe, as Managing Organization. 

In this respect, the Litigation Chamber underlines that appropriate arrangements must be 

made  between  the  respective  joint-controllers,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements 

foreseen under Article 26 GDPR. 

384.  CMPs are in principle required under the TCF Policies — developed and administered by the 

defendant — to offer by default all TCF-registered adtech vendors in their interface. If CMPs 

apply the TCF Policies, the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant is responsible for 

the  essential  means  of  processing,  since  IAB  Europe  determines  the  recipients  of  the 

personal data collected, and is thus jointly responsible for the transmission of the personal 

data, including some data in the bid request.  

385.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  CMPs  deviate  from  the  TCF  Policies,  the  Litigation  Chamber 

considers  that  this  time  the  CMPs  themselves  act  as  data  controllers  in  respect  of  the 

recipients of the personal data. To the extent that CMPs do not comply with the instructions 

imposed on them, they themselves are fully responsible168, in line with Article 28.10 GDPR.   

386.  Finally, when the CMPs determine the list of recipients in accordance with the publishers' 

instructions, the Litigation Chamber finds that the publishers bear the main responsibility 

for  the  transfer  of  personal  data  to  adtech  vendors,  without  prejudice  to  IAB  Europe’s 

responsibility, without which the global list of participating adtech vendors would not exist 

in the first place.   

b. Publishers 

387.  Publishers usually act as data controllers in the context of the TCF, as they are supposed to 

decide whether or not to cooperate with a registered CMP, and are also able to determine 

which adtech vendors are allowed to advertise on their website or in their application. In 

addition,  publishers  can  exercise  control  over  the  legal  ground  for  a  specific  processing 

purpose, and they can exclude certain processing purposes169. 

388.  Bid requests are sent by supply-side platforms (SSPs), in their capacity as representatives 

of the publishers, to demand-side platforms (DSPs), which represent adtech vendors.  The 

format and content (or "attributes") of such bid requests are determined in accordance with 

the technical specifications of the OpenRTB protocol, independently of the TCF.  

389.  As  confirmed  by  the  reports  of  the  Inspection  Service,  IAB  Europe  is  not  involved  in 

determining the attributes of a specific bid request. It is primarily the publishers of websites 

 

 

168 EDPB - Guidelines 7.2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, v2.0, para. 150. 
169 IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework Policies v2019-08-21.3 (Exhibit 32), pp. 21-22. 

84 

and applications who decide which attributes are included in a bid request and passed on to 

the adtech vendors.  

390.  A bid request contains at least a unique identifier for each bid request (Bid ID) and a unique 

identifier for the advertising space being auctioned (Item ID). In addition, a bid request will 

typically contain information about the user device, user details, website or application, and 

technical details about the advertising space (Impression)170.  

391.  On the basis of the foregoing, the Litigation Chamber finds that the bid request contains the 

most personal data, and that these data are not processed by the defendant, but mainly by 

the publishers, the CMPs and the various adtech vendors who, in principle, are all required 

to comply with the values of the TC String, in accordance with the policies of the TCF.  

392.  To  the  extent  that  a  publisher  relies  on  a  CMP  that  has  implemented  the  TCF,  the  bid 

request  will  also  contain  a  TC  String  indicating  the  preferences  of  the  website  visitor  or 

application user. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that this can be considered not 

only  as  additional  evidence  that  the  TC  String  is  indeed  personal  data,  as  it  concerns 

information  relating  to  an  identifiable  natural  person171,  but  also  demonstrates  that  the 

preferences stored in the TC String have a direct and significant effect on the subsequent 

processing activities.  

393.  Therefore, if a user knowingly or unknowingly gives his consent by means of an "accept all" 

button in a CMP interface, and both the website publisher and the CMP have not deviated 

from the full list of participating adtech vendors, this means that the personal data of the 

data subject will be shared with hundreds of third parties. 

394.  In line with its previous submission with regard to CMPs172, the Litigation Chamber rules that 

publishers also act as data controllers for the processing of users' preferences in a TC String 

as well as their personal data processed in a bid request.  

395.  In addition, the Litigation Chamber refers to Article 23.5 of the TCF Policies, which prohibits 

publishers from changing the processing purposes, or giving CMPs any instruction to that 

effect173.  

396.  Therefore, insofar as the publishers decide not to deviate from the proposed default list of 

adtech vendors and accept all the proposed processing purposes, the Litigation Chamber 

also  considers  that  IAB  Europe  is  acting  as  a  joint  data  controller  with  the  publishers  in

respect of the recipients of the TC String as well as the processing purposes for which the 

users' personal data will be processed.  

c. Adtech vendors 

397.  The Litigation Chamber has already determined that IAB Europe bears responsibility with 

regard to defining the various processing purposes under the TCF174.  

398.  When registering for TCF v2.0, adtech vendors must also choose the intended processing 

purposes and possible bases, based on a predetermined, fixed list of purposes.  

399.  In  this  sense,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  the  adtech  vendors,  together  with  the 

defendant, are jointly responsible for the processing operations that take place within the 

context  of  the  OpenRTB  for  the  processing  purposes  foreseen  under  the  TCF  and  in 

accordance with the preferences, objections and consents collected within the TCF. The 

latter aspect, however, does not affect the role that adtech vendors themselves play when 

they  specify  the  purposes  for  which  they  themselves  wish  to  process  the  personal  data 

contained in a bid request, or for subsequent data processing not provided for under the 

TCF175. 

400.  Moreover, the Litigation Chamber makes it clear that, similarly to the CMPs, adtech vendors 

are also required to register with the TCF in order to benefit from it. This means that the 

joint-controllership is limited to the registered adtech vendors176.  

d. Assessment by the Litigation Chamber 

401.  This factual  analysis of the role of CMPs, publishers and  adtech  vendors  shows that the 

decisions on determining the purposes and means of the processing activities carried out 

by the defendant within the context of the TCF (which aim to bring the processing activities 

carried out by the aforementioned participating organisations in line with the GDPR and the 

ePrivacy  Directive)  complement the decisions regarding  the purposes and  means of  the 

processing activities carried out by the participating organisations under the OpenRTB and 

should thus be regarded as convergent decisions. 

402.  This leads the Litigation Chamber to the conclusion that the defendant  as well as the 

CMPs,  publishers  and  participating  adtech  vendors  should  be  regarded  as  joint  data 

controllers  for  the  collection  and  dissemination  of  users'  preferences,  objections  and 

consent and for the subsequent processing of their personal data.

B.4. On the alleged breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation  

B.4.1 - Lawfulness and fairness of processing (Art. 5.1.a and 6 GDPR) 

403.  With  regard  to  the  lawfulness  and  fairness  of  the  processing,  the  Litigation  Chamber 

distinguishes two processing activities: on the one hand, the capture itself of the consent 

signal, objections and preferences of users in the TC String by the CMPs (a), and, on the 

other hand, the collection and dissemination of the users' personal data by the participating 

organisations (b). 

a. Registration of the consent signal, objections and users' preferences by means of the TC 

String 

404.  The Litigation Chamber finds that users are not informed anywhere of the lawful basis for 

the processing of their own, individual preferences in relation to purposes and permitted 

adtech vendors by CMPs. 

405.  The underlying reasoning of the defendant in this regard is that the TC String is not personal 

data and therefore no basis for its processing is required.  

406.  As  already  established,  the  Litigation  Chamber  does  not  agree  with  the  defendant's 

position177. The Litigation Chamber has established that the generation and dissemination 

of  the  TC  String  does  involve  the  processing  of  personal  data.178  Consequently,  this 

processing must in any case be based on one of the exhaustively listed processing grounds 

under  Article  6  of  the  GDPR.  For  this  reason,  the  Litigation  Chamber  will  consider  the 

question of whether one of the legal bases of Article 6 GDPR can be relied on.  

407.  First  of  all,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  neither  the  TCF  Policies  nor  the  TCF 

Implementation  Guidelines  mention  an  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  CMPs  to  obtain  the 

unambiguous consent of users before capturing their preferences in a TC String, which is 

placed on the end devices of users thanks to a euconsent-v2 cookie. Furthermore, users are 

never informed about the processing of their preferences by the TC String, with whom their 

preferences  are  shared,  nor  how  long  their  preferences  are  stored.  Since  the  visitors' 

consent  is  never  asked,  Article  6.1.a  de  facto  does  not  apply  as  a  legal  basis  for  this 

processing. 

408.  In addition, the Litigation Chamber points out that Article 6.1.b is prima facie not applicable 

to the processing of user preferences and the TC String. In the majority of the cases, even 

if  there  were  a  contractual  relationship  between  the  users  and  the  publisher,  the  data 

processing  involved  under  the  TCF  would  still  not  meet  the  requirement  of  objective 

 

 

177 See supra B.1.1. – Presence of personal data within the TCF. 
178 See supra B.1.2. - Processing of personal data within the TCF. 

87 

necessity for the provision of online services by the publishers to the users concerned (in 

particular for processing for the purposes of personalisation of content and for advertising 

based on surfing behaviour)179.  

409.  In the absence of any contractual relationship between the data subjects and CMPs or IAB 

Europe, as well as an unambiguous consent given by the users for placing a euconsent-v2 

cookie, the Litigation Chamber must assess whether Article 6.1.f (legitimate interest) could 

serve as legal basis:  does the legitimate interest pass the threefold test of the CJEU and, if 

so, could Article 6.1.f GDPR serve as a basis for this preliminary processing of the users' 

preferences by CMPs, in accordance with the means and purposes as set out by IAB Europe 

in its TCF Policies and TCF Implementation Guidelines? 

410.  In order to rely on Article 6.1.f GDPR as a legal ground for the processing of personal data, 

the  legitimate  interest  of  the  controller  or  third  parties,  which  is  closely  related  to  (yet 

distinct from) the concept of processing purpose, must be balanced against the interests or 

fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subjects.  Whereas  'purpose'  refers  to  the 

specific reason why the data are processed, i.e. the aim or intention of the data processing, 

the  notion  of  interest  is  linked  to  the  broader  stake  that  a  controller  may  have  in  the 

processing, or the benefit that the controller — or a third party, which must not necessarily 

qualify as a co-controller in respect of the data processing — derives from the processing180. 

411.  Pursuant  to  Article  6.1.f  of  the  GDPR  and  the  case  law  of  the  Court  of  Justice,  three 

cumulative conditions must be met in order for a controller to be able to validly rely on this 

grounds  for  lawfulness, "namely, firstly, the legitimate interests pursued by the controller 

or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, secondly, the necessity of 

processing  the  personal  data  for  the  purposes  of  the  legitimate  interest  pursued  and, 

thirdly, the condition that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not 

prejudiced" (Rigas judgment181). 

412. 

In order to be able to invoke the ground for lawfulness of "legitimate interest" under Article 

6.1.f of the GDPR, the controller must demonstrate, in other words, that:  

1)  the interests it pursues with the processing can be recognised as legitimate (the 

'purpose test');

2)  the  processing  envisaged  is  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  achieving  those 

interests (the "necessity test"); and 

3)  the balancing of these interests against the interests, fundamental freedoms and 

rights of data subjects weighs in favour of the data controller or a third party (the 

"balancing test"). 

413.  As  regards  the  first  condition,  the  Litigation  Chamber  considers  that  the  purpose  of 

capturing users' approval and preferences in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate 

that users have validly consented to or not objected to the processing of their personal data 

for advertising purposes may be considered to be carried out for a legitimate interest.  

414.  The  interest  pursued  by  the  defendant  as  the  data  controller  may,  in  accordance  with 

recital 47 of the GDPR, be regarded as legitimate in itself. More specifically, the possibility 

of  storing  the  preferences  of  users182  is  an  essential  part  of  the  TCF  and  the  Litigation 

Chamber notes that this is done in the legitimate interest of the defendant as well as of third 

parties involved, such as the participating adtech vendors.  

415.  Thus, the first condition set out in Article 6.1.f of the GDPR is fulfilled. 

416.  In order to fulfil the second condition, it must then be demonstrated that the processing is 

necessary for the achievement of the purposes pursued. This means, in particular, that the 

question must be asked whether the same result can be achieved by other means without 

processing personal data or without processing that is unnecessarily burdensome for the 

data subjects. 

417. 

In view of the objective of enabling both website or application publishers and participating 

adtech providers to communicate the purposes of their processing in a transparent manner, 

to  establish  a  valid  legal  basis  for  the  processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of 

providing digital advertising, and to obtain consent — or to identify whether an objection has 

been raised to the processing of data based on their legitimate interest183, the Litigation 

Chamber must verify whether the personal data included in the TC String are limited to what 

is strictly necessary to capture the consent, objections and preferences of a specific user.  

418.  This  second  condition  is  also  met  by  compliance  with  the  principle  of  data  minimisation 

(Article 5.1.c of the GDPR).  The Litigation Chamber notes that the information processed in 

a TC String184 is limited to data that are strictly necessary to achieve the intended purpose.

to a processing based on Article 6.1.f GDPR at the time of the collection of personal data.

Chamber has not been able to establish that the TC String is retained indefinitely. 

419.  In order to verify whether the third condition of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR — the so-called 

"balancing  test"  between  the  interests  of  the  data  controller,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the 

fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject, on the other hand — can be met, the 

reasonable expectations of the data subject must be taken into account in accordance with 

recital 47 of the GDPR. In particular, it should be evaluated whether the data subject “may 

reasonably expect, at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that 

processing may take place for that purpose”185. 

420.  This is also emphasised by the Court of Justice in its judgment "Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc 

M5A-ScaraA"186, in which it states: 

“Also relevant for this are the data subject 's reasonable expectations that his or her personal 

data will not be processed when, in the given circumstances of the case,  the data subject 
cannot reasonably expect further processing of the data.” 

421. 

In this regard, the Litigation Chamber finds it remarkable that no option is offered to users 

to  completely  oppose  the  processing  of  their  preferences  in  the  context  of  the  TCF. 

Regardless of which choice they make, the CMP will generate a TC String before linking it 

to the user's unique User ID through a euconsent-v2 cookie placed on the data subject's 

end device.  

422.  Moreover, since users are not informed of the installation of an euconsent-v2 cookie on 

their  terminal  device,  whether  or  not  they  agree  with  the  purposes  and  adtech  vendors 

offered by the CMP, and moreover they are not informed of their right to object to such 

processing, the Litigation Chamber finds that the last condition of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR 

is currently not met. 

423.  The severity of the breach of the data subject's rights and freedoms is also  an  essential 

element  of  the  assessment  under  Article  6.1.f  GDPR.    The  result  of  this  assessment  

depends on the particular circumstances of a specific case187. In this context, according to 

the Court of Justice, particular account should be taken of 'the nature of the personal data 

concerned, in particular their potentially sensitive nature, and of the nature and specific way 

in which they are processed, in particular the number of persons having access to them and 

the  way  in  which  they  acquire  such  access'188.  In  this  context,  the  Litigation  Chamber

emphasises the large number of participating organisations that are given access to the TC 

String, in addition to the reduced control by the data subjects over the nature and the scope 

of the processing of their personal data by these organisations.  

424.  In  the  absence  of  a  valid  legal  basis,  the  Litigation  Chamber  rules  that  the  data 

processing in the context of the TCF in its current format, whereby CMPs capture the 

preferences of online users in a TC String, does not comply with Article 6 of the GDPR.  

425.  It  is  therefore  undeniable  to  the  Litigation  Chamber  that  IAB  Europe,  as  Managing 

Organisation for the TCF, has failed to provide a legal basis for the processing of user 

preferences in the form of a TC String and has therefore breached article 6 GDPR.   

b. Collection and dissemination of personal data in the context of the RTB  

426.  It is in no way disputed that the TCF is aimed at capturing, through the interfaces offered by 

the CMPs, the consent of users or their lack of objection to the legitimate interests of the 

participating adtech vendors.  

427.  For  the  record,  the  Litigation  Chamber  emphasises  that  these  two  bases  relate  to 

processing  activities  that  take  place  under  the  RTB,  in  accordance  with  the  OpenRTB 

protocol. 

428.  However,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  none  of  the  legal  grounds  proposed  and 

implemented  by  the  TCF  can  be  lawfully  invoked  by  TCF  participants.  First  of  all,  the 

Litigation Chamber considers that the consent of the data subjects obtained through CMPs 

is not legally valid (i) nor is the (pre)contractual necessity applicable  (ii). Furthermore, the 

Litigation Chamber finds that the legitimate interest does not meet the threefold test of the 

CJEU (iii).  Thus, Article 6 of the GDPR is infringed.  

(i)  -  Consent is not a valid basis for the processing operations  in  the OpenRTB 

facilitated by the TCF 

429.  In order to ensure that publishers and adtech vendors comply with the stricter transparency 

and consent requirements under the GDPR with respect to the processing of personal data 

in  the  context  of  OpenRTB  (or  RTB  in  general),  CMPs  provide  a  relatively  standardised 

interface for users to choose whether to consent or object to the transfer of their personal 

data to hundreds of third parties at once, for specified purposes. 

430.  On  the  basis  of  the  documents  in  this  file,  the  Litigation  Chamber  understands  that  the 

participants can pursue one or more purposes from the 12 standardised purposes that the 

91 

TCF makes available to participating adtech vendors and that are offered to users by means 

of the CMPs189. 

431.  However, the system of CMPs poses problems on several levels, with the result that the 

consent obtained by these CMPs (via the TCF) for the processing carried out in the context 

of the OpenRTB is not legally valid in light of Article 7 GDPR. 

432.  In order to be used as a legitimate basis, consent under Article 7 of the GDPR must meet 

strict conditions. However, for the reasons set out below, the Litigation Chamber finds that 

the  consent  collected  by  CMPs  and  publishers  in  the  current  version  of  the  TCF  is 

insufficiently free, specific, informed and unambiguous.  

433.  First  of  all,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  the  proposed  processing  purposes  are  not 

sufficiently clearly described, and in some cases are even misleading190. By way of example, 

the Litigation Chamber finds that purpose 8 ("Measure content performance") and 9 ("Apply 

market research to generate audience insights")191 provide little or no insight into the scope 

of the processing, the nature of the personal data processed or for how long the personal 

data processed will be retained if the user does not withdraw his consent. 

434.  Furthermore, based on the documents in the file, the Litigation Chamber understands that 

the  user  interface  of  the  CMPs  does  not  provide  an  overview  of  the  categories  of  data 

collected, which makes it impossible for users to give their informed consent.  

435.  The Litigation Chamber also notes that the TCF makes it particularly difficult for users to 

obtain more information about the identity of all data controllers to whom they give consent 

to process their data for certain purposes before obtaining their consent. In particular, the 

recipients  for  whom  consent  is  obtained  are  so  numerous  that  users  would  need  a 

disproportionate amount of time to read this information, which means that their consent 

can rarely be sufficiently informed. 

436.  Moreover, the information CMPs provide to users remains too general to reflect the specific 

processing  operations  of  each  vendor,  thus  preventing  the  necessary  granularity  of 

consent. 

437.  In addition, the Litigation Chamber takes the view that the enrichment of the data in a bid 

request  with  personal  data  already  held  by  the  adtech  vendors  and  the  relevant  Data 

Management Platforms means that users cannot possibly be properly informed, since the 

TCF in its current format does not provide for participating organisations to indicate what 

 

 

189 For an overview of these TCF purposes, see para. 337 of this decision.

92 

personal data they already hold and what processing operations they already perform with 

these data. 

438.  Finally,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  consent,  once  obtained  by  CMPs,  cannot  be 

withdrawn by users as easily as it was given, as required by Article 7 GDPR. First of all, the 

Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  under  the  TCF  Policies,  adtech  vendors  are  required  to 

comply with a user's consent signals in real time192, while no measure is provided to ensure 

that  adtech  vendors  cannot  continue  their  processing  based  on  a  previously  received 

consent  signal.  After  all,  the  TCF  does  not  provide  for  proactive  communication  of  the 

changed consent signals to the adtech vendors. In addition, adtech vendors can in principle 

no longer access the personal data of the data subject after the latter has withdrawn his 

consent, which also means that they cannot identify the user for whom consent has been 

withdrawn  as  such,  with  the  result  that  the  adtech  vendors  will  continue  to  process  the 

personal data of the user in question193.  

439.  Indeed,  the  Litigation  Chamber  understands  that  CMPs  are  at  the  intersection  between 

users and participating adtech vendors, who receive their personal data and then process 

them for their own purposes. Such a configuration therefore means that the withdrawal of 

a consent via a CMP will only take effect as soon as the vendor concerned reads the new 

values in the modified TC String via the CMP API. In other words, the withdrawal of consent 

is never immediate and thus cannot be considered effective.  

440.  Therefore, the Litigation Chamber concludes that Article 6.1.a GDPR does not constitute a 

valid legal basis for the processing and dissemination of personal data in the context of the 

OpenRTB, insofar as such consent was obtained in accordance with the TCF in its current 

format. 

(ii) - The legitimate interest of the participating organisations does not outweigh 
the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects. 

441.  The question is then to what extent the organisations participating both in the TCF and the 

OpenRTB (adtech vendors) can legitimately rely on Article 6.1.f GDPR for the predefined 

processing purposes that entail targeted advertising or profiling of the users, as opposed to 

non-marketing  related  purposes  such  as  audience  measurement  and  performance 

measurement. 

442.  As referred to previously194, the assessment of the legitimate interests should be done on 

the basis of the three steps approach established by the Court of Justice. This assessment

Protection Law", German Law Journal, 31 July 2021, p. 26.

93 

shall be conducted by the data controllers prior to a processing operation based on Article 

6.1.f  GDPR.  They  determine  the  means  and  purposes  of  the  intended  personal  data 

processing  activities  and  are  thus  able  to  apply  appropriate  safeguards  to  prevent  a 

disproportionate impact on the data subjects. In case of several controllers which are jointly 

responsible, the principles of accountability and transparency require that the assessment 

should be performed jointly by all the data controllers involved in the processing.  

443.  As stated by the Article 29 Working Party, both positive and negative consequences should 

be taken into consideration when assessing the impact of the processing, which must be 

necessary  and  proportionate  to  achieve  the  legitimate  interests  pursued  by  the  data 

controllers or a third party. Such consequences may include “potential future decisions or 

actions by third parties, and situations where the processing may lead to the exclusion of, 

or discrimination against, individuals, defamation, or more broadly, situations where there is 

a risk of damaging the reputation, negotiating power, or autonomy of the data subject”195 . 

444.  With regard to the purpose test, in particular whether the interests pursued by publishers 

and  adtech  vendors  in  processing  personal  data  can  be  recognised  as  legitimate,  the 

Litigation  Chamber  understands  that  the  participating  organisations  have  an  interest  in 

collecting  and  processing  users'  personal  data  in  order  to  be  able  to  offer  tailor-made 

advertisements. 

445.  Based on the case law of the Court of Justice and the guidelines of the EDPB, the Litigation 

Chamber  finds  that  the  notion  of  legitimate  interest  can  have  a  broad  scope,  with  the 

understanding that an interest invoked by a data controller must be sufficiently specific, 

existent, current, and not hypothetical196.  

446.  In this regard, the Litigation Chamber can only note that the proposed processing purposes 

are described in general terms, with the result that it is not easy for users to assess to what 

extent the collection, dissemination and processing of their personal data are necessary for 

the intended purposes, insofar as these are also understood by the users.  

447.  In order to be relevant, a legitimate interest must be in accordance with applicable EU and 

national  law; sufficiently  specific  and clearly  articulated to  allow the balancing  test to  be 

carried out, and represent a real and present interest. Hence, merely invoking a legitimate 

interest in the processing of personal data is not sufficient; the outcome of the balancing 

test will determine whether Article 6.1.f GDPR can be relied upon197.

448.  The  TCF  Policies  do  not  foresee  an  obligation  for  the  CMPs  to  explain  the  legitimate 

interests  at  stake  in  clear  terms  to  the  users.  Instead,  the  specific  user  interface  (UI) 

requirements contained in the TCF Policies for framework UIs in connection with legitimate 

interests,  only  require  from the CMPs  that  a secondary  information layer be provided198, 

allowing the users to: 

i. 

see information about the fact that personal data is processed, and the nature of 

the personal data processed (e.g. unique identifiers, browsing data); 

ii. 

see information about the scope of the legitimate interest processing and scope of 

any objection to such processing; 

iii. 

access settings within the Framework UI to object to processing of their personal 

data on the basis of a legitimate interest; 

iv. 

review the list of processing purposes including their standard name and their full 

standard description, as defined in Appendix A of the TCF Policies, and to provide 

users with a way to see which vendors are processing their data for  each of the 

purposes on the basis of a legitimate interest; 

v. 

exercise their right to object, either with respect to each adtech provider whose 

processing is based on legitimate interest or, separately, for each purpose pursued 

by adtech providers on the basis of legitimate interest; 

vi. 

review the list of named vendors, their purposes and legal bases, and find a link to 

each vendor’s privacy policy. 

449.  By way of example, the Litigation Chamber refers to the definitions for processing purpose 

5 (Create a personalised content profile), in Appendix A of the TCF Policies199: 

 

 

198 IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework Policies v2020-11-18.3.2a, pp. 67-68.  
199 IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework Policies v2020-11-18.3.2a, p. 32. 

95 

450.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  TCF  Policies  state  that  they  establish  minimum 

requirements for  language,  design and other elements in the Framework UI, intended  to 

align with legal requirements of EU privacy and data protection law, the Litigation Chamber 

also notes that the general rules and requirements for framework UIs further specify that:  

 

“b. When providing transparency about Purposes and Features, the Framework UI must do 

so only on the basis of the standard Purpose, Special Purpose, Feature, and Special Feature 
names and definitions of Appendix A as they are published on the Global Vendor List or using 
Stacks200 in accordance with the Policies and Specifications.  UIs must make available the 

standard  legal  text  of  Purposes,  Special  Purposes,  Features,  and  Special  Features  of 
Appendix  A  but  may  substitute  or  supplement  the  standard  legal  definitions  with  the 

standard user friendly text of Appendix A so long as the legal text remains available to the 
user and it is explained that these legal texts are definitive.” 

451.  The Litigation Chamber interprets these general rules as prohibiting CMPs and publishers 

participating to the TCF  from further explaining to the data subjects, in a clear and user-

friendly manner, both the pursued legitimate interests as well as the reasons for believing 

 

 

200 Stacks are, in essence, combination of different processing purposes. 

96 

that their interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms 

of the data subjects201.   

452.  Although, in the context of the present case, the Litigation Chamber does not express an 

opinion on whether an economic interest202 can be regarded as a legitimate interest within 

the meaning of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR, it considers that the lack of specificity of the stated 

purposes means that the first condition for specific lawful processing is not met with the 

standard descriptions of the processing purposes and pursued interests, as imposed by the 

TCF Policies. 

453.  In  the  context  of  the  necessity  test,  which  aims  to  determine  whether  the  intended 

processing  operations  are  necessary  for  achieving  the  interests  pursued,  the  question 

should be asked whether the legitimate interests pursued by the processing of data could 

not reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means with less interference with 

the fundamental freedoms and rights of data subjects, in particular their right to respect for 

their privacy and their right to the protection of personal data as guaranteed by Articles 7 

and 8 of the Charter203. 

454.  The Court of Justice has also clarified that the condition of necessity of processing must be 

examined in relation to the principle of data minimisation laid down in Article 5.1.c GDPR204. 

In  other  words,  according  to  the  EDPB,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  whether  other,  less 

invasive means are available to achieve the same objective.  

455.  In this case, the Litigation Chamber understands that no safeguards are provided to ensure 

that the personal data collected and disseminated are limited to information that is strictly 

necessary for the purposes intended205.  

456.  In the absence of measures that adequately demonstrate that no inappropriate personal 

data are being disseminated, the Litigation Chamber is forced to decide that the second 

condition has not been met. 

457.  With regard to the balancing test, in particular whether the interests pursued by the adtech 

vendors  outweigh  the  fundamental  freedoms  and  rights  of  the  data  subjects,  the

204 Ibidem, para. 48. 
205 In this respect, some authors argue that there are alternatives to RTB, in which only minimal information about the user 
is communicated. See M. VEALE, FR. ZUIDERVEEN BORGESIUS, "Adtech and Real-Time Bidding under European Data Protection 
Law", German Law Journal, 31 July 2021, pp. 19 et seq. The authors refer in particular to the browser plug-in Adnostic, which 
was developed 10 years ago and builds up a profile based on the user's surfing behaviour in order to target advertisements, 
with  only  minimal  information  leaving  the  user's  device  and  behavioural  targeting  taking  place  exclusively  in  the  user's 
browser.  In  addition,  the  authors  refer  to  Google's  so-called  Federated  Learning  of  Cohorts  (FLoC)  system  for 
microtargeting within Chrome.  

97 

reasonable  expectations  of  the  data  subjects  should  also  be  taken  into  account  in 

accordance  with  recital  47  of  the  GDPR,  in  addition  to  the  special  circumstances  of  the 

particular case206. 

458.  The criterion of the seriousness of the breach of the rights and freedoms of the data subject 

constitutes an essential element of the case-by-case assessment required by Article 6.1.f 

GDPR207.  In  this  context,  according  to  the  Court  of  Justice,  particular  account  should  be 

taken of 'the nature of the personal data concerned, in particular their potentially sensitive 

nature,  and of  the nature  and specific  way in  which they  are processed, in particular  the 

number of persons having access to them and the way in which they acquire such access'208. 

459.  Once again, the Litigation Chamber finds that due to the large number of TCF partners that 

may receive their  personal  data, data subjects cannot  reasonably  expect the processing 

associated with this disclosure. In addition, there is the considerable amount of data that, in 

accordance with the preferences entered within the TCF system, is collected by means of 

a bid request and transmitted to the adtech vendors within the context of the OpenRTB 

protocol209.  

460.  Furthermore, as the EDPB states, the legitimate interest does not constitute a sufficient 

legal  basis  in  the  context  of  direct  marketing  involving  behavioural  advertising210.  In 

addition, the ICO concluded in a recent report that the legitimate interest is not a basis for 

legality  in  the  context  of  RTB  (yet  many  publishers  rely  on  this  legal  ground  for  their 

processing) 211. In short, in view of the above, the Litigation Chamber has decided that the 

third condition imposed by Article 6.1.f GDPR and the case law of the Court of Justice has 

not been met in this case. 

461.  In  light  of  the  aforementioned  considerations,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  the 

legitimate interest of participating organizations cannot be deemed an adequate legal 

ground  for  the  processing  activities  occurring  under  the  OpenRTB,  based  on  users’ 

preferences and choices captured under the TCF.

(iii)  -  Contractual  necessity 

is  not  a  valid  basis  for  the  processing  of  

personal data in the context of TCF and OpenRTB 

462.  In  line  with  the  EDPB  guidelines,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that,  in  general,  the 

(pre)contractual necessity of the processing is not a legal ground applicable to behavioural 

advertising212.  

463.  Moreover,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  current  version  of  the  TCF  does  not 

mention  Article  6.1.b  GDPR  anywhere  as  a  possible  legal  basis  for  the  processing  of 

personal data within the TCF and OpenRTB. 

464.  On the basis of the foregoing elements, the Litigation Chamber therefore concludes that 

the  processing  of  personal  data  under  the  OpenRTB  on  the  basis  of  preferences 

captured  in  accordance  with  the  current  version  of  the  TCF  is  incompatible  with  the 

GDPR, due to an inherent breach of the principles of lawfulness and fairness. 

B.4.2. - Duty of transparency towards data subjects (Art. 12, 13 and 14 GDPR) 

465.  The complainants raise the issue of the lack of transparency, and more specifically the fact 

that the OpenRTB ecosystem is so extensive that it is impossible for data subjects to give 

an informed consent to the processing of their personal data, or to object in an informed 

manner to the processing of their personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest. 

466.  The  defendant,  on  the  other  hand,  states  that  the  TCF  offers  a  solution  to  collect  valid 

consent from users, where applicable, in accordance with the requirements set out in the 

GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive213.  

467.  The Litigation Chamber finds that the information  provided  under  the TCF  in its current 

format  to  data  subjects,  albeit  for  the  purposes  of  processing  their  personal  data  in  the 

context of OpenRTB, does not meet the transparency requirements under the GDPR214.  

468.  First of all, the Litigation Chamber states that IAB Europe may in certain cases claim the 

"records of consent" that CMPs are required to keep, in accordance with the TCF Policies215, 

but fails to inform data subjects of this possible processing by IAB Europe.  

469.  Secondly, the Litigation Chamber finds that the manner in which information is provided to 

the  data  subjects,  which  was  laid  down  by  IAB  Europe,  does  not  comply  with  the 

requirement of a "transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form"216. The former

216 Art. 12.1 GDPR. 

99 

Article 29 Working Party stipulates in its transparency guidelines that "the requirement that 

information  and  communication  to  data  subjects  be  provided  "in  a  concise,  transparent, 

comprehensible and easily accessible form" means that data controllers should present the 

information/communication in an efficient and concise manner in order to avoid information 

fatigue"217. Moreover, data subjects should be able to determine in advance the scope and 

consequences of the processing  and not be surprised  later  by other ways in which  their 

personal data have been used218.  

470.  The Litigation Chamber finds that the approach taken so far does not meet the conditions 

of transparency and fairness required by the GDPR. Indeed, some of the stated processing 

purposes  are  expressed  in  too  generic  a  manner  for  data  subjects  to  be  adequately 

informed about the exact scope and nature of the processing of their personal data219. This 

is particularly problematic for purposes that rely on the consent of data subjects, as consent 

must be specific and sufficiently informed in order to be valid as a legal basis220. 

471.  The  Litigation  Chamber  also  refers  to  the  examples  of  CMPs  specified  in  the  Technical 

Report of the  Inspection Service, and notes that the interface offered to users does not 

allow, among other things, the processing purposes associated with the authorisation of a 

particular vendor or which adtech vendors will process their data for a specific purpose to 

be identified in a simple and clear manner221.  

472.  In that regard, the Litigation Chamber emphasises that the large number of third parties, i.e. 

the adtech vendors that will potentially receive and process the personal data of the users 

contained  in  the  bid  request,  based  on  the  preferences  they  have  submitted,  is  not 

compatible  with  the  condition  of  a  sufficiently  informed  consent,  nor  with  the  broader 

transparency duty set out in the GDPR. 

473.  On the basis of the foregoing elements, the Litigation Chamber must therefore rule that the 

TCF in its current set-up does not comply with the obligations arising from the transparency 

principle, notably Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR.

B.4.3.  -  Accountability  (art. 24  GDPR),  data  protection  by  design  and  by  default  (Art. 25 

GDPR), integrity and confidentiality (Art. 5.1.f GDPR), as well as security of processing (Art. 

32 GDPR) 

a. Principle of accountability and data protection by design and by default 

474.  Article  24.1  GDPR  requires  the  data  controller  to  implement  appropriate  technical  and 

organisational measures, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of 

processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms 

of natural persons, to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in 

accordance with the GDPR. Moreover, these measures shall be reviewed and updated as 

necessary. This article reflects the principle of “accountability” set out in Article 5.2 of the 

GDPR,  according  to  which  the  controller  shall  be  responsible  for,  and  be  able  to 

demonstrate  compliance  with,  paragraph  1  (accountability).  Article  24.2  of  the  GDPR 

stipulates  that,  where  proportionate  in  relation  to  processing  activities,  the  measures 

referred  to  in  Article  24.1  GDPR  shall  include  the  implementation  of  appropriate  data 

protection policies by the controller.  

475.  Recital 74 of the GDPR adds that “the responsibility and liability of the controller for any 

processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller's behalf should 

be  established.  It  is  important,  in  particular,  that  the  controller  is  responsible  for 

implementing appropriate and effective measures and for demonstrating the conformity of 

the processing activities with this regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. 

These  measures  must  take  account  of  the  nature,  scope,  context  and  purpose  of  the 

trafficking and the risk it poses to the rights and freedoms of physical persons”. 

476.   It is also incumbent on the controller, pursuant to Articles 24 (accountability) and 25 of the 

GDPR (data protection by design and by default), to integrate the necessary respect for the 

GDPR  rules  into  its  processing  and  procedures,  e.g.  to  ensure  the  existence  and 

effectiveness  of  procedures  for  handling  data  subject  requests  and  for  checking  the 

integrity and compliance of the TC String.  

b. The outline of the security obligation  

477.  Pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR, the controller is responsible for ensuring the security of 

the processing, “taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and 

the  nature,  scope,  context  and  purposes  of  processing  as  well  as  the  risk  of  varying 

likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons”.  In the present case, 

the Litigation Chamber notes a lack of respect for the obligation to ensure the security of 

processing on the part of the defendant, which is part of the principle of accountability. This 

shortcoming will be addressed below.  

101 

478.  This  failure  to  meet  the  obligation  to  ensure  the  security  of  processing  constitutes  a 

fundamental point of the present decision and of the penalties it imposes. The absence of 

technical and organisational measures aiming to ensure or tend to ensure the integrity of 

the TC String is considered a serious offence.   

479.  On the basis of Article 5.1.f GDPR, personal data must be processed in such a way as to 

ensure  appropriate  security, 

including  protection  against  unauthorised  or  unlawful 

processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical 

or organisational measures. In the absence of appropriate measures to secure the personal 

data  of  the  data  subjects,  the  effectiveness  of  the  respect  of  the  fundamental  rights  to 

privacy and to the protection of personal data cannot be guaranteed, especially in view of 

the crucial role played by information and communication technologies in our society. 

480.  As  indicated  in  the  previous  section,  the  lack  of  an  obligation  to  ensure  the  security  of 

processing constitutes an important point in the decision222. Given the very large number of 

TC Strings generated each day within the TCF, it is essential that all  the rules governing 

participation in the TCF are observed and complied with by all the parties involved, under 

the  supervision  of  IAB  Europe  as  the  "Managing  Organisation".    The  Litigation  Chamber 

recalls that the combined reading of articles 32 (Security of processing), as well as 5.2 and 

24 GDPR (principle of accountability) requires the controller to demonstrate its compliance 

with  Article  32,  by  taking  appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures,  in  a 

transparent and traceable manner. 

481.  The Litigation Chamber also recalls the requirement of Article 25 GDPR (data protection by 

design  and  by  default),  which  requires  the  data  controller  to  integrate  the  necessary 

compliance with the rules of the GDPR  upstream of its actions. 

482.  It should also be noted that the principle of security with its various components of integrity, 

confidentiality and availability of the data is set out in Articles 5.1.f and 32 of the GDPR and 

is now regulated in the GDPR at the same level as the fundamental principles of legality, 

transparency and loyalty.  

483.  IAB Europe offers the TCF to make OpenRTB compliant with the GDPR.  In other words, the 

purpose of the TCF is to ensure that processing of personal data within the context of the 

OpenRTB  protocol  takes  place  in  accordance  with  the  GDPR  as  well  as  the  ePrivacy 

Directive.  Accordingly,  IAB  Europe,  as  Managing  Organisation  for  the  TCF  and  jointly 

responsible for the processing operations carried out within that framework223, should take

Framework. 

102 

organisational and technical measures to ensure that participants at least comply with the 

TCF policies.  

484.  Notwithstanding the fact that in IAB Europe's current TCF system, adtech vendors receive 

consent signals as part of an HTTP(S) request or via browser APIs, some authors take the 

view  that insufficient measures are in place under the TCF  to  guarantee the integrity  of 

consent signals (particularly their validity) and to ensure that a vendor has actually received 

them (as opposed to having generated them itself)224.  

485.  However, in the absence of validation by IAB Europe, it becomes theoretically possible for 

CMPs to falsify or modify the signal to generate a euconsent-v2 cookie and thus reproduce 

a  "false  consent"  from  users  for  all  purposes  and  all  adtech  vendors.  This  case  is  also 

explicitly provided for in the TCF Policies: 

“A Vendor must not create Signals where no CMP has communicated a Signal and shall only 

transmit Signals communicated by a CMP or received from a Vendor who forwarded a Signal 

originating  from  a  CMP  without  extension,  modification,  or  supplementation,  except  as 
expressly allowed for in the Policies and/or Specifications.”225 

486.  The  Litigation  Chamber  takes  note  of  the  fact  that  the  possibility  of  falsification  or 

modification  of  the  TC  String  by  CMPs  is  foreseen  in  the  defendant's  Transparency  & 

Consent Framework Policies document, which sets out the basis for the TCF.  

487.  The Litigation Chamber also relies on the fact that the defendant indicates on its website 

the  introduction  of  the  "TCF  Vendor  Compliance  Programme",  through  which  audits  of 

organisations participating in the TCF (listed on the Global Vendors List) will take place226. 

The  Litigation  Chamber  encourages  all  initiatives  on  the  part  of  the  defendant,  that  are 

aimed at ensuring compliance with the obligation to process personal data under the TCF 

in a secure manner on the part of the defendant. Nevertheless, in view of the defendant's 

lack  of  systematic  monitoring  of  compliance  with  the  TCF  rules  by  the  participating 

organisations,  and  taking  into  account  the  significant  impact  of  such  violations  (e.g. 

falsification or  modification of the TC String), the  Litigation Chamber considers that this 

initiative to introduce the TCF Vendor Compliance Programme is insufficient to bring the 

defendant into compliance with the security obligation.  

488.  In particular, the Litigation Chamber relies on the fact that the sanctions regime of this new 

programme, provided by the defendant in the case of failure to comply with the rules of the 

 

 

224 See on this subject, for example C. SANTOS, M. NOUWENS, M. TOTH, N. BIELOVA, V. ROCA, "Consent Management Platforms 
Under the GDPR: Processors and/or Controllers?", in Privacy Technologies and Policy, APF 2021, LNCS, vol 12703, Springer, 
2021, p. 64.

103 

TCF,  is  permissive  and  not  dissuasive.  In  fact,  a  vendor  may  declare  himself  liable  for  a 

breach up to 3 times, without any sanction, before being given 28 days to comply.  Only in 

the event of non-compliance after the expiry of the 28 days will the vendor be removed 

from the Global Vendors List. It can also re-enter the list if it complies with the requirements 

later on. The programme also allows a vendor to be in breach up to four times, in order to 

proceed to an immediate suspension during a brief period of 14 days, until the vendor comes 

into compliance.  The " TCF Vendor Compliance Programme " is therefore not a sufficient 

measure for ensuring the security of personal data processing operations carried out under 

the TCF. 

489.  The  Litigation  Chamber  also  observes  that  no  measures  other  than  the  «  TCF  Vendor 

Compliance  Programme  »  are  foreseen  by  the  defendant  to  monitor  or  prevent  the 

falsification or modification of the TC String. 

490.  With regard to the allegation by the plaintiffs that IAB Europe also violates Articles 44 to 49 

GDPR,  the  Litigation  Chamber  acknowledges,  in  view  of  the  scope  of  the  Framework 

— which  involves  a  large  number  of  participating  organisations —  that  it  is  evident  that 

personal data captured in the TC Strings will be transferred outside the EEA at some point 

by CMPs, and that the defendant is acting as data controller in this regard (see para. 356-

357). However, the Litigation Chamber notes that the Inspection Service did not include an 

assessment  of  a  concrete  international  data  transfer  in  its  report.  For  this  reason,  the 

Litigation Chamber concludes that there is an infringement of the GDPR, but in view of the 

lacking  evidence  of  a  systematic  international  transfer,  as  well  as  the  scope  and  nature 

thereof, the Litigation Chamber finds it is not in a position to sanction the defendant for a 

violation of articles 44 to 49 GDPR. Notwithstanding the previous, the Litigation Chamber 

also  finds  that  these  international  transfers  of  personal  data,  where  applicable,  must  be 

assessed  primarily  by  the  publishers  and  CMPs  implementing  the  TCF.  The  Litigation 

Chamber finds that the publishers are responsible and accountable for taking the necessary 

measures to prevent personal data collected through their website and/or application from 

being transferred outside the EEA without adequate international transfer mechanisms. 

491.  This being said, the Litigation Chamber also finds that the defendant should facilitate the 

due diligence incumbent on the publishers and CMPs, e.g. by requiring adtech vendors to 

indicate clearly whether they are located outside the EEA or whether they intend to transfer 

personal data outside the EEA through their data processors. Furthermore, the Litigation 

Chamber notes that, contrary to its obligation under the principles of accountability and of 

data protection by design and by default, IAB Europe did not foresee any mechanism to 

ensure that participating publishers and CMPs have put in place adequate mechanisms for 

potential international transfers of the TC String, as foreseen under Articles to 44 to 49 

GDPR, both at the time of its creation and when transmitting the TC String to participating 

adtech  vendors.  The preamble  of the TCF  Policies  merely indicates that the  TCF  “is not 

104 

intended  nor  has  it  been  designed  to  facilitate  […]  more  strictly  regulated  processing 

activities, such  as transferring  personal  data outside of the  EU”. The Litigation Chamber 

finds that this does not meet the requirements of Articles 24 and 25 GDPR.  

492.  The  Litigation  Chamber  notes,  for  the  record,  that  it  is  uncertain  whether,  in  view  of  its 

current architecture and support of the OpenRTB protocol, the TCF can be reconciled with 

the GDPR. 

493.  In this sense, IAB Europe’s accountability starts from the moment the organisation designs 

and makes available a system for the management of consent or objections of users, but 

fails to take the necessary measures to ensure the conformity, integrity and validity of that 

consent or objection. 

494.  The Litigation Chamber therefore finds that, as part of its security and integrity obligations, 

IAB Europe  must take not only  organisational  but also technically effective  measures to 

ensure  and  demonstrate  the  integrity  of  the  preferential  signal  transmitted  by  CMPs  to 

adtech vendors.  

B.4.4. - Additional alleged breaches of the GDPR 

a. Purpose limitation and data minimisation (Art. 5.1.b and 5.1.c GDPR) 

495.  Although in this decision the Litigation Chamber has already concluded that the processing 

operations carried out on the basis of the OpenRTB protocol are not in accordance with the 

basic  principles  of  purpose  limitation  and  data  minimisation227  (as  no  safeguards  are 

provided to ensure that the personal data collected and disseminated within the framework 

of  the  OpenRTB  are  limited  to  information  that  is  strictly  necessary  for  the  intended 

purposes),  the  Litigation  Chamber  emphasises  that  the  complainants  have  explicitly 

indicated in their submissions that the scope of their allegations is limited to the processing 

operations within the TCF. The Inspection Service also clarified in its report that IAB Europe 

does not act as a data controller for the processing operations that take place entirely in the 

context of the OpenRTB protocol. 

496.  Taking these clarifications into account, the Litigation Chamber concludes that, given the 

limited  amount  of  data  about  a  user  that  is  stored  in  a  TC  String  before  being  saved  by 

means of a euconsent-v2 cookie, there is no violation of the principles of purpose limitation 

and data minimisation in the context of the TCF. 

 

 

227 See para. 495-496 of this decision 

105 

497.  Although  larger  quantities  of  personal  data  will  be  processed  at  a  later  stage,  including 

special  categories  of  personal  data,  this  is  not  the  case  with  the  TCF.  Within  the  TCF, 

therefore, there is no violation of the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation. 

b. Storage limitation (Art. 5.1.e GDPR)  

498.  With  regard  to  the  principle  of  storage  limitation  and  based  on  the  Inspection  Service’s 

report, the Litigation Chamber finds there is insufficient evidence that the TC String and the 

associated storage of users' personal data are stored for an unauthorised period of time, in 

violation of Article 5.1.e GDPR.  

499.  Therefore, the Litigation Chamber concludes that no violation of article 5.1.e GDPR could 

be established. 

c. Integrity and confidentiality (Art. 5.1.f GDPR) 

500.  As already explained above228, the Litigation Chamber finds that the current version of the 

TCF offers insufficient safeguards to prevent the values included in a TC String from being 

modified in an unauthorised manner, with the result that the personal data of a data subject 

bundled in a bid request may be processed for the wrong purposes, in breach of the integrity 

principle, and/or may end up with the wrong  adtech vendors or the ones rejected by the 

user, in breach of the confidentiality principle. The Litigation Chamber therefore rules that 

the current version of the TCF violates Article 5.1.f of the GDPR. 

d. Processing of special categories of personal data (Art. 9 GDPR) 

501.  Although  a  number  of  complaints  are  directed  against  the  RTB  system,  including  the 

Authorized  Buyers  protocol  developed  by  Google  as  well  as  the  OpenRTB  protocol 

developed by IAB Tech Lab, the Inspection Service determined in its report, as a preliminary 

matter, that the Belgian Data Protection Authority did not have jurisdiction for the former 

and that IAB Tech Lab does not act as a data controller for the latter229.  

502.  The Litigation Chamber notes that the Inspection Service reports the lack of appropriate 

rules for the processing of special categories of personal data under the TCF. However, this 

observation is not supported by any technical analysis showing that special categories of 

personal data are actually processed within the TCF. On the contrary, the technical analyses 

by the Inspection Service show that the TC String in itself does not contain any information 

that  can  be  linked  to  the  taxonomy  of  the  websites  visited,  where,  for  example,  special 

categories of personal data may be involved. 

 

 

228 See para. 477 et seq. of this decision. 
229 Investigation report of the Inspection Service, pp. 8-11. 

106 

503.  Therefore, the Litigation Chamber rules that this allegation is unfounded and that no breach 

of Article 9 of the GDPR by the defendant can be established. 

e. Exercise of data subject rights (Art. 15 – 22 GDPR) 

504.  First of all, the Inspection Service notes in its report that certain complainants have argued 

the  impossibility  for  the  data  subjects  to  enforce  their  rights,  although  the  investigation 

carried out by the Inspection Service did not confirm these allegations. In view of the lack 

of  evidence  of  any  infringement,  the  Litigation  Chamber  limits  its  reasoning  to  general 

observations relating to the exercise of data subject rights. 

505.  Secondly,  the  Litigation  Chamber  refers  to  the  scope  of  the  written  submissions  by  the 

complainants,  in  which  they  specifically  restricted  their  grieves  to  the  processing  of  the 

plaintiffs’ personal data by the defendant in the particular context of the TCF230. As a result, 

the  Litigation  Chamber  will  not  assess  the  circumstances  in  which  data  subjects  may 

exercise  their  rights  regarding  the  processing  of  personal  data  contained  in  the  bid 

requests,  with  respect  to  the  adtech  vendors,  seeing  as  this  processing  occurs  entirely 

under the OpenRTB protocol. 

506.  However, with regard to the current version of the TCF, the Litigation Chamber finds that 

the TCF does not seem to facilitate the exercise of the data subjects’ rights insofar as the 

CMP interface cannot be retrieved easily and at all times by the users, such as to allow them 

to amend their preferences and retrieve the identity of the adtech vendors with whom their 

personal data have been shared by means of a bid request, in accordance with the OpenRTB 

protocol.  In  this  regard,  the  Litigation  Chamber  underlines  the  importance  of  a  proper 

implementation and enforcement of the interface requirements defined in the TCF Policies, 

such as to allow data subjects to effectively exercise their rights vis-à-vis each of the joint-

controllers, and notes that the shared responsibility to do so lies primarily with the CMPs 

and publishers.  In the light of the foregoing, the Litigation  Chamber  is, however, not in  a 

position to establish a violation of the Articles 15-22 GDPR.  

f. Records of processing activities (Art. 30 GDPR) 

507.  The  Inspection  Service  notes  in  its  report  that  IAB  Europe  does  not  keep  records  of  its 

processing  activities.  The  defendant  takes  the  view,  first  of  all,  that  it  can  rely  on  the 

exception  provided  for  in  Article  30.5  of  the  GDPR  and  is  therefore  not  subject  to  the 

obligation to keep such records. However, in the course of the investigation, the defendant 

added a summary of its processing activities to the documents in the file231. 

 

 

230 Submission of the complainants dd. 18 February 2021, p. 2. 
231 IAB Europe's response to the investigation 10 February 2020 (Exhibit 57), p. 23. 

107 

508.  The  Litigation  Chamber  first  notes  that  the  records  submitted  by  the  defendant  do  not 

contain  any  activity  relating  to  the  TCF,  with  the  exception  of  member  management, 

including administration of the TCF. Contrary to the defendant's assertion, in particular that 

the records do not need to include the processing activities in the context of the TCF, the 

Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that the records must at least include access to users' 

consent signals, objections and preferences.  

509.  Indeed, in accordance with Article 8 of the TCF Policies (v1.1)232 and Article 15 of the TCF 

Policies (v2.0)233, the defendant reserves the right, as the Managing Organisation, to access 

the "records of consent". The Litigation Chamber also emphasises that the incidental nature 

of this access to users’ preferences has not been proven or raised by the defendant. The 

stable  relationship  between  IAB  Europe  as  Managing  Organisation  and  all  organisations 

participating in the TCF ecosystem should also be taken into account. In view of the large 

number  of  participating  organisations  and  the  defendant's  intention  to  monitor  the 

compliance  of  the  various  CMPs  and  other  adtech  vendors  234,  more  thoroughly  in  the 

future, IAB Europe should also include this processing in its records of processing activities. 

510.  Therefore, the Litigation Chamber considers the non-incidental nature of the processing 

and the infringement of Article 30.1 GDPR found by the Inspection Service to be sufficiently 

proven.  

g. Data protection impact assessment (Art. 35 GDPR) 

511.  The Litigation Chamber first notes that the defendant does not deny that the TCF can also 

be used for RTB purposes.  

512.  The argumentation by the defendant that the TCF can be used for other, non-marketing-

related  purposes  and  that  the  OpenRTB  can  also  operate  separately  from  the  TCF  is 

therefore  not  relevant  to  the  consideration  of  whether  or  not  a  data  protection  impact 

assessment is required.  

513.  After all, the interrelationship between the TCF and the RTB implies that the preferences 

users  enter  by  using  a  CMP  interface  will  necessarily  have  an  impact  on  the  way  their 

personal  data  are  subsequently  processed  by  adtech  vendors  within  the  RTB,  as 

determined by the OpenRTB specification.

514.  The Litigation Chamber further refers to Decision No. 01/2019 of the General Secretariat of 

the  Belgian DPA235, in which the General  Secretariat has established  a list of  processing 

operations for which a data protection impact assessment is mandatory.  

515.  It is undisputed for the Litigation Chamber that the TCF was developed, among other things, 

for the RTB system, in which the online behaviour of users is observed, collected, recorded 

or influenced in a systematic and automated manner, including for advertising purposes236. 

It is also not disputed that within the RTB, data is widely collected from third parties (Data 

Management  Platforms,  or  DMPs)  in  order  to  analyse  or  predict  the  economic  situation, 

health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements of 

natural persons237. 

516.  Considering the large number of data subjects who come into contact with websites and 

applications  implementing  the  TCF,  as  well  as  the  growing  number  of  organisations 

participating  in  the  TCF,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  impact  of  the  TCF  on  the  large-scale 

processing  of personal  data in  the  context of  RTB, on the other, the Litigation Chamber 

finds that, in accordance with Decision No. 01/2019, the Defendant is indeed subject to the 

obligation to conduct a data protection impact assessment, pursuant to Article 35 of the 

GDPR.  Hence, Article 35 of the GDPR is violated.  

h. Designation of a Data Protection Officer (art. 37 GDPR) 

517.  Article 37 GDPR provides for an obligation to designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in 

cases where:  

i. 

ii. 

processing is carried out by a public authority or public body; or 

a controller or processor is primarily responsible for processing operations which, 

by  virtue  of  their  nature,  their  scope  and/or  their  purposes,  require  regular  and 

systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or 

iii. 

the  controller  or  processor  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  processing  of  large 

volumes of special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the GDPR and of

518.  The Litigation Chamber has already concluded that the defendant processes personal data 

because IAB Europe, in its capacity as Managing Organisation, can have access to the TC 

Strings and the records of consent238. 

519.  The former Article 29 Working Party states that processing activities that are necessary to 

achieve the purposes of the controller or processor can be considered as core activities 

within the meaning of Article 37  GDPR. The Litigation Chamber finds that in  view of the 

importance of the TCF  to the defendant, the stated purposes of the TCF, as well as the 

associated  processing  of  personal  data  in  its  capacity  as  Managing  Organisation,  the 

processing under the TCF belongs to the core activities of IAB Europe. 

520.  With regard to the concept of 'large-scale processing operations', the Article 29 Working 

Party clarifies that, inter alia, the following must be taken into account: 

i. 

the number of data subjects - either as a specific number or as a proportion of the 

relevant population; 

the amount of data and/or range of the different data items processed; 

the duration or permanence of data processing; 

the geographical extent of the processing activity. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

In the present case , the Litigation Chamber finds that the TCF is offered in various Member 

States; that the TCF intrinsically requires that the personal data of users be processed in 

the  form  of  a  TC  String  for  as  long  as  this  is  necessary  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  that 

consent  was  obtained  in  accordance  with  the  TCF  Policies;  and  that  the  personal  data 

processed is furthermore shared with numerous adtech vendors. From this, the Litigation 

Chamber concludes that the TCF involves the large-scale processing of personal data. 

521.  With regard to the criterion of regular and systematic observation the WP29 interprets the 

term "regular" in one or more of the following ways: 

i. 

something that occurs continuously or at specific times during a certain period of 

time 

ii. 

iii. 

something that occurs in a recurring manner, or repetitively at fixed times; or 

something that occurs constantly or periodically 

The  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  the  contractual  obligation  for  Vendors  and  CMPs  to 

submit records of consent to the defendant, in its capacity as Managing Organisation, upon 

simple  request  by  IAB  Europe  falls  within  (i).  Thus,  there  is  regular  observation  of  data 

relating to identifiable users. 

522.  The term "systematic" should be understood in one or more of the following ways: 

 

 

238 See para. 358 and 468 of this decision. 

110 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

Something that occurs according to a system 

Prearranged, organised or methodical 

Something that occurs in the context of a general data collection programme 

Something carried out as part of a strategy 

523.  Once again, the Litigation Chamber finds that the processing of the TC Strings or records 

of consent by the defendant in the current version of the TCF meets at least the first three 

criteria. Therefore, the Litigation Chamber rules that the TCF must be regarded as a regular 

and systematic observation of identifiable users. 

524.  From the foregoing  elements, the Litigation Chamber concludes that IAB Europe should 

have appointed a DPO, in accordance with Article 37 GDPR. Hence, Article 37 of the GDPR 

is violated. 

 

C. Sanctions 

525.  As a preliminary  matter,  and  as developed  below,  the Litigation Chamber notes that  the 

present decision on the TCF does not directly address deficiencies of the wider OpenRTB 

framework. However,  the Litigation Chamber does draw attention to the great risks to the 

fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects posed by OpenRTB, in particular in 

view of the large scale of personal data involved, the profiling activities, the prediction of 

behaviour, and the ensuing surveillance (see A.3.1. - Definitions and operation of the Real-

Time Bidding system). Insofar as the TCF is the tool on which OpenRTB relies to justify its 

compliance with the GDPR, the TC String plays a pivotal role in the current architecture of 

the OpenRTB system. 

526.  Under Article 100 of the DPA Act, the Litigation Chamber has the power to:  

1° classify the complaint without taking action;   

2° order the dismissal of the case;   

3° pronounce a suspension of the pronouncement;   

4° propose a transaction;  

5° formulate warnings or recommendations;   

6° order to comply with the requests of the person concerned to exercise these 

rights; 

7° order that the interested party be informed of the security problem; 

8°  order  the  freezing,  restriction  or  temporary  or  permanent  prohibition  of 

processing;  

9° order the compliance of the treatment; 

10°  order  the  rectification,  restriction  or  erasure  of  data  and  the  notification  to 

recipients of the personal data; 

111 

11° order the withdrawal of the certification bodies' accreditation; 

12° impose fines; 

13° impose administrative fines; 

14° order the suspension of data flows to another State or international body; 

15° forward the file to the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office, which informs it of 

the action relating to the file; 

16° decide, case by case,  to publish its decisions on the internet site of the Data 

Protection Authority.  

527.  As for the administrative fine that may be imposed pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR and 

Articles 100, 13° and 101 DPA Act, Article 83 of the GDPR provides: 

«  1.  Each  supervisory  authority  shall  ensure  that  the  imposition  of  administrative  fines 
pursuant  to  this  Article  in  respect  of  infringements  of  this  Regulation  referred  to  in 
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 

Administrative  fines  shall,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  each  individual  case,  be 
imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 
58(2).  When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount 
of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following:  

a) 

the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature 
scope  or  purpose  of  the  processing  concerned  as  well  as  the  number  of  data 
subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them; 

b) 

the fact that the violation has been committed deliberately or through negligence; 

c)  any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by 

data subjects; 

d) 

the  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  or  processor  taking  into  account 
technical and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 
25 and 32; 

e)  any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor; 

f) 

the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the 
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement; 

g) 

the categories of personal data affected by the infringement; 

h) 

the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, 
in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified 
the infringement; 

i)  where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against 
the  controller  or  processor  concerned  with  regard  to  the  same  subject-matter, 
compliance with those measures; 

j) 

adherence  to  approved  codes  of  conduct  pursuant  to  Article  40  or  approved 
certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and 

112 

k)  any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the 
case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from 
the infringement. ». 

528.  Recital 150 GDPR239 further distinguishes between whether the offender is an undertaking 

or not. In the first hypothesis, the criterion (fixed amount or percentage) for reaching the 

highest fine should be applied. Where, on the other hand, the offender is not an undertaking, 

account should be taken of the economic situation of the offender and the general level of 

incomes  in  the  Member  State  concerned.  This  is  to  prevent  the  imposition  of  fines  that 

could be disproportionately high. 

529.  It is important to contextualise the shortcomings of the defendant in order to identify the 

most appropriate corrective measures. In this context, the Litigation Chamber will take into 

account all the circumstances of the case, including — within the limits it specifies below — 

the  reaction  submitted  by  the  defendant  to  the  envisaged  sanctions  communicated  by 

means of the sanction form240. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber specifies that the form 

it  sent  expressly  mentions  that  it  does  not  involve  the  reopening  of  debates.  Its  sole 

purpose is to collect the defendant's reaction to the planned sanctions.  

530.  While measures such as a compliance order or a ban on further processing can put an end 

to an identified infringement, administrative fines, as set out in Recital 148 of the GDPR, are 

imposed  in  case  of  serious  infringements,  in  addition  to  or  instead  of  the  appropriate 

measures that are required to remedy the infringement.  

531.  The Litigation Chamber would also like to point out that it is its sovereign responsibility as 

an independent administrative authority — in compliance with the relevant articles of the 

GDPR  and  the  DPA  Act  —  to  determine  the  appropriate  corrective  measure(s)  and 

sanction(s).  This  follows  from  Article  83  GDPR  itself,  but  also  the  Market  Court  has 

emphasised the existence of a wide margin of manoeuvre in its case law,  inter  alia in its 

judgment of 7 July 2021241.  

532.  The  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  complainants  are  making  various  requests  for 

sanctions against the defendant. However, it is not for the complainants to ask the Litigation 

Chamber to order any particular corrective measure or sanction, nor is it up to the Litigation 

Chamber  to  give  reasons  for  not  accepting  any  of  the  requests  made  by  the 

 

 

239  Recital  150  of  the  GDPR:  '[...]  Where  administrative  fines  are  imposed  on  an  undertaking,  an  undertaking  should  be 
understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative 
fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should take account of the general level 
of income in the Member State as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the 
fine.[…]”.

complainants242.  These  considerations  nevertheless  leave  intact  the  obligation  for  the 

Litigation  Chamber  to  give  reasons  for  the  choice  of  measures  and  sanctions  which  it 

deems appropriate (from the list of measures and sanctions made available to it by Article 

58 of the GDPR and Article 100 of the DPA Act) to sentence the defendant. 

533.  In  the  present  case,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  complainants  request  the 

Litigation  Chamber  to  take  the  following  measures  and  sanctions.  These  proposals  are 

included for information:  

"1) In application of Article 100, §1, 8° DPA Act (relating to IAB Europe) to: 

a.  prohibit the TC String to be processed in the TCF; 
b.  prohibit  all  personal  data  associated  with  the  processing  of  the  TC  String,  such  as  IP 

addresses, websites visited and apps used, from being processed in the TCF; 

c.  order  the  permanent  removal  from  its  website  and  its  other  public  communication 
channels of all documents, files and records that in any way incite or oblige any third party 

to carry out such processing; 

2) In application of Article 100, §1, 10° DPA, order IAB Europe to permanently delete all TC Strings 
and  other  personal  data  already  processed  in  the  TCF  from  all  its  IT  systems,  files  and  data 
carriers, and from the IT systems, files and data carriers of processors contracted by IAB Europe; 

3)  In application of Article 100, §1, 10° DPA Act order IAB Europe to inform all recipients of the 

personal data processed in the TCF of the order imposed by the Litigation Chamber: 

a.  prohibition to process the TC String in the TCF; 
b.  prohibit  all  personal  data  associated  with  the  processing  of  the  TC  String,  such  as  IP 

addresses, websites visited and apps used, from being processed in the TCF; 

c.  order to permanently delete all TC Strings and other personal data already processed in 

the TCF from all IT systems, files and data carriers; 

and this both clearly visible and readable in a bold box at the top of the homepage of IAB Europe's 

website  www.iabeurope.eu  in  the  usual  font  and  size  until  6  months  after  a  judgment  of  the 
Market Court becomes final, if applicable pursuant to Section 108 of the DPA Act, or by email, in 
both  cases  with  a  hyperlink  to  the  English-language  version  of  the  decision  of  the  Litigation 

Chamber on the website of the GBA; 

4)  In application of Article 100, §1, 12° DPA Act on behalf of IAB Europe order the forfeiture of a 
penalty  payment  of  EUR  25,000  per  started  calendar  day  of  delay  in  the  execution  of  any 
measure imposed in the interlocutory decision of the Litigation Chamber as from the expiration 

of seven calendar days after the interlocutory decision of the Litigation Chamber.”  

 

 

242  See  Court  of  Appeal  of  Brussels,  Market  Court  Section,  19th  Chamber  A,  Market  Cases  Section,  1  December  2021,

114 

534.  A sanction form has been sent to the defendant on 11 October 2021. IAB Europe submitted 

its response on 1 November 2021243. This response has been taken into consideration in the 

following paragraphs. 

C.1. - Breaches 

535.  The Litigation Chamber found the defendant in breach of the following articles: 

▪  Articles 5.1.a and 6 GDPR — The current TCF does not provide a legal basis for the 

processing  of  user  preferences  in  the  form  of  a  TC  String.  Moreover,  the  Litigation 

Chamber notes that the TCF offers two bases for the processing of personal data by 

participating adtech vendors, but finds that none of them can be used. First, the consent 

of the data subjects is currently not given in a sufficiently specific, informed and granular 

manner. Second, the legitimate interest of the organisations participating in the TCF is 

outweighed by the interests of the data subjects, in view of the large-scale processing 

of  the  users’  preferences  (collected  under  the  TCF)  in  the  context  of  the  OpenRTB 

protocol and the impact this can have on them. Since none of the grounds for lawfulness 

set  out  in  Article  6  of  the  GDPR  apply  to  this  processing,  as  explained  above244,  the 

defendant is in breach of Articles 5.1.a and 6 GDPR.  

Taking note of the fact that the defendant itself does no longer have factual or technical 

control over the TC Strings once these have been generated by the CMPs and stored 

on  the  users’  devices245,  the  Litigation  Chamber  finds  that  it  cannot  impose  the  a 

posteriori  removal  of  all  TC  Strings  generated  until  now  on  the  defendant.  More 

specifically, it is the responsibility of the CMPs and the publishers who implement the 

TCF246, to take the appropriate measures, in line with Articles 24 and 25 GDPR, ensuring 

that  personal  data  that  has  been  collected  in  breach  of  Articles  5  and  6  GDPR  is  no 

longer  processed  and  removed  accordingly.  Insofar  as  IAB  Europe  is  still  storing 

TC Strings deriving from the no longer supported globally scoped consent cookies, the 

Litigation Chamber  equally finds that the  necessary measures  must be taken  by  the 

defendant to warrant permanent erasure of these no longer necessary personal data. 

▪  Articles 12, 13, and 14 GDPR — As developed above (see B.4.2. - Duty of transparency 

towards data subjects (Art. 12, 13 and 14 GDPR)), the way in which the information is 

provided  to  the  data  subjects  does  not  meet  the  requirement  of  a  'transparent, 

comprehensible  and  easily  accessible  manner’.  Users  of  a  website  or  an  application 

 

 

243 See title A.10. - Sanction form, European cooperation procedure, supra. 
244 See title B.4.1 - Lawfulness and fairness of processing (Art. 5.1.a and 6 GDPR). 
245 In accordance with the mandatory policies and technical specifications established and imposed on TCF participants by 
IAB Europe. 
246 Furthermore, the Litigation Chamber underlines the fact that none of the CMPs and adtech vendors haven taken part in 
the present proceedings.  

115 

participating  in  the  TCF  are  not  given  sufficient  information  about  the  categories  of 

personal  data  collected  about  them,  nor  are  they  able  to  determine  in  advance  the 

scope  and  consequences  of  the  processing.  The  information  given  to  users  is  too 

general  to  reflect  the  specific  processing  of  each  vendor,  which  also  prevents  the 

granularity — and therefore the validity — of the consent received for the processing 

carried  out  using  the  OpenRTB  protocol.  Data  subjects  are  unable  to  determine  the 

scope  and  consequences  of  the  processing  in  advance,  and  therefore  do  not  have 

sufficient  control  over  the  processing  of  their  data  to  avoid  being  surprised  later  by 

further processing of their personal data. 

▪  Articles 24, 25, 5.1.f and 32 GDPR — As explained above247, on the basis of Articles 5.1.f 

and 32 GDPR, the controller is obliged to ensure the security of the processing and the 

integrity  of  the  personal  data  processed.  The  Litigation  Chamber  recalls  that  the 

combined reading of Articles 5.1.f and 32, as well as 5.2 and 24 GDPR (subjecting the 

controller to the principle of accountability) requires the controller to demonstrate its 

compliance  with  Article  32,  by  taking  appropriate  technical  and  organisational 

measures,  in  a  transparent  and  traceable  manner.  Under  the  current  TCF  system, 

adtech  vendors  receive  a  consent  signal  without  any  technical  or  organisational 

measure to ensure that this consent signal is valid or that a vendor has actually received 

it (rather than generated it). In the absence of systematic and automated monitoring 

systems of the participating CMPs and adtech vendors by the defendant, the integrity 

of the TC String is not sufficiently ensured, since it is possible for the CMPs to falsify the 

signal  in  order  to  generate  an  euconsent-v2  cookie  and  thus  reproduce  a  "false 

consent" of the users for all purposes and for all types of partners. As indicated above248, 

this hypothesis is also specifically foreseen in the terms and conditions of the TCF. The 

Litigation  Chamber  therefore  finds  that  IAB  Europe,  in  its  capacity  of  Managing 

Organisation, has designed and provides a consent management system, but does not 

take  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  the  validity,  integrity  and  compliance  of  users' 

preferences and consent.  

The Litigation Chamber also finds that the current version of the TCF does not facilitate 

the exercise of the data  subject rights, especially  taking  into  consideration the joint-

controllership  relation  between  the  publisher,  the 

implemented  CMP  and  the 

defendant.  The Litigation Chamber  also  underlines that  the  GDPR  requires that  data 

subjects rights can be exercised vis-à-vis each of the joint-controllers in the TCF such 

as to comply with Articles 24 and 25 GDPR.    

 

 

247 See title B.4.3. - Accountability (art. 24 GDPR), data protection by design and by default (Art. 25 GDPR), integrity and 
confidentiality (Art. 5.1.f GDPR), as well as security of processing (Art. 32 GDPR) 
248 See para. 485 of this decision. 

116 

In light of the above, the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant is in breach of its 

obligations of security of processing, integrity of personal data, and data protection by 

design and data protection by default (Articles 24, 25, 5.1.f and 32 GDPR). 

▪  Article 30 GDPR — As developed above249, the Litigation Chamber cannot follow the 

defendant's  argument  that  it  can  benefit  from  the  exceptions  to  the  obligation  to 

maintain  records  of  processing  activities,  provided  for  in  Article  30.5  GDPR.  As  the 

records  of  processing  activities  of  the  defendant  do  not  contain  any  processing 

operations  relating  to  the  TCF,  except  for  the  management  of  members  and  the 

administration of the TCF, although IAB Europe as Managing Organisation can access 

the records of consent, the Litigation Chamber finds a breach of Article 30 GDPR by the 

defendant. 

▪  Article 35 GDPR — In view of the large number of data subjects that come into contact 

with  websites  and  applications  implementing  the  TCF,  as  well  as  organisations 

participating in the TCF, on the one hand, and the impact of the TCF on the large-scale 

processing of personal data in the OpenRTB system, on the other hand, the Litigation 

Chamber finds that IAB Europe has failed to carry out a comprehensive data protection 

impact  assessment (DPIA) with regard to  the processing  of personal  data  within  the 

TCF, and thus violated Article 35 GDPR. The Litigation Chamber finds that the TCF was 

developed, among other things, for the RTB system, in which the online behaviour of 

users  is  observed,  collected,  recorded  or  influenced  in  a  systematic  and  automated 

manner,  including  for  advertising  purposes.  It  is  also  not  disputed  that  within  the 

OpenRTB,  data  are  widely  collected  from  third  parties  (DMPs)  in  order  to  analyse  or 

predict the economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or 

behaviour, location or movements of natural persons. 

▪  Article 37 GDPR — Because of the large-scale, regular and systematic observation of 

identifiable  users  that  the  TCF  implies,  and  in  view  of  the  defendant's  role,  more 

specifically of its capacity as Managing Organisation, the Litigation Chamber rules that 

IAB Europe should have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO). By failing to do so, 

the defendant infringes Article 37 GDPR. 

 

 

 

 

 

249 See para. 507 et seq. of this decision. 

117 

C.2. - Sanctions 

536.  Therefore, the Litigation Chamber orders the defendant: 

I. 

To  render  the  TCF  compliant  with  the  obligation  of  lawfulness,  fairness  and 

transparency  (Articles  5.1.a  and  6  GDPR),  by  establishing  a  legal  basis  for  the 

processing as well as the sharing of user preferences in the context of the TCF, in 

the form of a TC String and euconsent-v2 cookie placed on the users' devices for 

this purpose. These obligations also imply that any personal data collected so far by 

means of a TC String in the context of the globally scoped consents, which is no 

longer  supported  by  IAB  Europe,  shall  be  deleted  without  undue  delay  by  the 

defendant. In addition, the Litigation Chamber orders the defendant to prohibit the 

use  of  legitimate  interest  as  a  legal  ground  for  processing  by  the  organisations 

participating in TCF in its current format, via its terms of use.  

II. 

To  render  the  TCF  compliant  with  the  transparency  and  information  obligation 

(Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR), by requiring TCF-registered CMPs to take a 

harmonised  and  GDPR-compliant  approach  regarding  the  information  to  be 

provided  to  users  through  their  interface.  The  information,  which  covers  the 

categories  of  data  collected,  the  purposes  for  which  they  are  collected,  and  the 

applicable 

legal  grounds  for  processing,  must  be  precise,  concise  and 

understandable in order to avoid users being surprised by subsequent processing 

of their personal data by parties other than the publishers or IAB Europe. 

III. 

To ensure compliance of the TCF with the obligations of integrity and security, as 

well as data protection by design and by default (under Articles 5.1.f and 32 GDPR, 

and 25 GDPR). In this respect, the Litigation Chamber orders to include effective 

technical and organisational monitoring measures to facilitate the exercise of data 

subject  rights  and  to  guarantee  the  integrity  of  the  TC  String  in  view  of  the 

possibility,  in  the  current  state  of  the  system,  of  falsification  of  the  signal.  An 

example of  measures to  be put in place under Article 32  of the GDPR  is  a strict 

vetting process for organisations participating to the TCF. The Litigation Chamber 

reminds the defendant as well as the other joint-controllers of their obligation to 

make the necessary arrangements such as to ensure, amongst other requirements, 

that  data  subjects  may  effectively  exercise  their  rights.  Lastly,  in  the  context  of 

Article  25  of  the  GDPR,  the  defendant  must  prohibit,  via  its  terms  of  use,  the 

organisations participating in the current version of TCF from activating a default 

consent, as well as from basing the lawfulness of the intended processing activities 

on the legitimate interest. 

IV. 

To ensure the compliance of the records of processing activities carried out in the 

framework  of  the  TCF  in  its  current  format,  and  in  particular  relating  to  the 

118 

processing of users' preferences and consent in the form of a TC String and the 

placement of a cookie euconsent-v2 on their devices. 

V. 

To carry out a data protection impact assessment, covering both the processing 

activities  under  the  TCF  and  the  impact  of  these  activities  on  subsequent 

processing under the OpenRTB.  

VI. 

To designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO), responsible,  inter alia, for ensuring 

the compliance of personal data processing activities in the context of the TCF, in 

accordance with Articles 37 to 39 of the GDPR. 

537.  These compliance measures should be completed within a maximum period of six months 

following the validation of an action plan by the Belgian Data Protection Authority, which 

shall be submitted to the Litigation Chamber within two months after this decision. On the 

ground of Article 100 § 1er, 12° of the DPA Act, a penalty payment of 5.000 EUR per day will 

be due in case of failure to comply within the above-mentioned time limits. 

538.  In  addition  to  this  compliance  order,  the  Litigation  Chamber  is  of  the  opinion  that  an 

administrative fine is justified in this case for the following reasons, which are analysed on 

the basis of article 83.2 GDPR.   

539.  The principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency and security are part of the essence of 

the GDPR and infringements of these rights are punishable by the highest fines, according 

to  Article  83.5  GDPR.  In  this  respect,  the  failure  to  respect  the  basic  principles  of  data 

protection  should  be  penalised  by  proportionately  high  fines,  depending  on  the 

circumstances of the case. In this regard, reference can be made to the Guidelines on the 

Application and Setting of Administrative Fines, according to which: 

«  Fines  are    an  important  tool  that    supervisory  authorities    should  use  in  appropriate  

circumstances.  The   supervisory  authorities  are  encouraged  to  use  a  considered  and  

balanced  approach  in  their  use  of   corrective  measures,  in  order  to  achieve  both  an  
effective  and  dissuasive  as  well  as  a  proportionate   reaction to the breach.   The point is 
to not qualify the fines as last resort, nor to shy away from issuing fines, but on the other hand 
not to use them in such a way which would devalue their effectiveness as a tool. »250 

540.  In  its  subparagraph  (a),  article  83.2.  refers  to  «  the  nature,  gravity  and  duration  of  the 

infringement taking into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing concerned 

as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them ».  

541.  With regard to the nature and gravity of the infringements, the Litigation Chamber notes 

that the principles of lawfulness (Articles 5.1.a and 6 GDPR), transparency (Articles 12 to 14 

 

 

250 Article 29 Working Party  – Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the 
Regulation 2016/679 (WP 253), p. 7. 

119 

GDPR)  as well  as security (Articles 5.1.f  and 32  GDPR) are  fundamental  principles of the 

protection regime set up by the GDPR. The principle of accountability set out in Article 5.2. 

of the GDPR and developed in Article 24 is also at the heart of the GDPR and reflects the 

paradigm  shift  brought  about  by  the  GDPR,  i.e.  a  shift  from  a  regime  based  on  prior 

declarations and authorisations by the supervisory authority to greater accountability and 

responsibility  of  the  controller.  Respect  of  its  obligations  by  the  latter  and  its  ability  to 

demonstrate this are therefore only more important.  

542.  A valid legal basis and transparent information are core elements of the fundamental right 

to data protection. As far as transparency is concerned, this principle is the 'gateway' that 

strengthens the control of data subjects over their personal data and enables the exercise 

of other rights granted to the data subjects by the GDPR, such as the right to object and the 

right of erasure. Breaches of these principles constitute serious infringements, which may 

be subject to the highest administrative fines foreseen under the GDPR. 

543.  The breach of Article 25, on the obligation of data protection by design and by default, as 

well  as  of  Article  30  on  keeping  records  of  processing  activities  are  also  significant 

infringements, particularly in view of the scale of the processing operations and the impact 

on the privacy of the complainants as well as the other users confronted with websites or 

applications that have implemented the TCF. 

544.  As regards the nature and purpose of the processing, and more specifically on the nature of 

the  data,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that  the  TC  String,  as  an  expression  of  users' 

preferences on the processing purposes and the potential adtech vendors being provided 

through the CMP interface, constitutes the cornerstone of the TCF. Although the scope of 

this  decision  is  the  TCF  and  its  TC  String,  and  the  sanction  imposed  on  the  defendant 

pertains  solely  to  that  framework,  the  compliance  of  the  OpenRTB  with  the  GDPR  is 

assessed as part of a holistic analysis of the TCF and its interaction with the former. Insofar 

as  the  current  version  of  the  TCF  is  the  tool  on  which  OpenRTB  relies  to  justify  its 

compliance with the GDPR, and because the defendant facilitates membership and use of 

the OpenRTB to a significant number of participating organisations, the Litigation Chamber 

finds that IAB Europe plays a pivotal role as regards the OpenRTB, without being a data 

controller in that context.  

545.  As  regards  the  scope  of  the  contested  processing  and  the  number  of  data  subjects 

affected, the Litigation Chamber notes that the TCF (in its current format), as developed by 

the defendant (representing large players in the online behavioural advertising sector251), 

offers a unique service on the market.  The  TCF’s scope is therefore  essential, given the 

growing number of partners that signed up to it. Regarding the level of damage incurred by 

 

251 See para. 36 of this decision. 

 

120 

concerned data subjects, the Litigation Chamber underlines once more that the TC String 

plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  current  architecture  of  the  OpenRTB  system.  Thereby,  the 

TC String supports a system posing great risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of 

the  data  subjects,  in  particular  in  view  of  the  large  scale  of  personal  data  involved,  the 

profiling  activities,  the  prediction  of  behaviour,  and  the  ensuing  surveillance  of  data 

subjects. 

546.  With respect to the duration of the infringement, the Litigation Chamber takes note that 

the TCF is offered by the defendant since 25 April 2018 as a mechanism for obtaining users' 

consent with respect to predetermined processing purposes, and for the transfer of their 

personal data to TCF-participants, including adtech vendors. Notwithstanding the various 

iterations of the framework, which has been upgraded to the second version of the TCF on 

21 August 2019, and taking into  account the systemic deficiencies of the TCF  under the 

GDPR, the Litigation Chamber finds that the breaches have existed at least since May 2018, 

with regard to the validity of the collected consent and the placement of a TC String without 

a valid legal ground, and since August 2019 for the reliance on legitimate interest as a legal 

ground to process the data subjects’ personal data. 

547.  Article  83.2.b  GDPR  requires  the  DPA  to  take  into  account  the  intentional  or  negligent 

character  of  the  infringement.  Observing  that  the  defendant,  in  its  role  as  Managing 

Organisation,  was  aware252  of  risks  linked  to  non-compliance  with  the  TCF,  in  particular 

relating to the integrity of the TC String and the encapsulated choices and preferences of 

the  users,  and  in  light  of  the  impact  of  the  TC  String  on  the  subsequent  processing 

operations under the OpenRTB, the Litigation Chamber finds that IAB Europe was negligent 

in establishing the measures governing the implementation of the current version of the 

TCF. 

548.  In its subparagraph (c), article 83.2 GDPR refers to potential actions taken by the controller 

to  mitigate  the  damage  suffered  by  data  subjects.  The  Litigation  Chamber  notes  the 

absence of concrete measures taken or introduced by the defendant in order to mitigate 

the  damage  suffered  by  the  data  subjects  (i.e.  the  processing  of  their  personal  data 

regardless of their choices, or in the absence of a valid legal ground). 

549.  Article  83.2.d  of  the  GDPR  concerns  the  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  or 

processor,  taking  into  account  technical  and  organisational  measures  implemented  by 

them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32.  

550.  Even  if  the  Litigation  Chamber  does  not  take  into  account  in  the  present  decision  the 

developments  that  occurred  after  the  closure  of  the  proceedings  in  June  2021,  the 

 

252 See para. 485 of this decision. 

 

121 

Litigation Chamber takes note that the defendant already announced during the hearing253 

its  intention  to  introduce  a  "TCF  Vendor  Compliance  Programme"  in  September  2021, 

through which audits of organisations participating in the TCF (listed on the Global Vendors 

List) will be established.  

551.  The Litigation Chamber encourages all measures aimed at ensuring compliance with the 

GDPR.  Nevertheless,  as  explained  in  para.  487-488,  in  view  of  the  defendant's  lack  of 

systematic monitoring of compliance with the TCF rules by the participating organisations 

at  the  time  of  the  complaints,  and  taking  into  account  the  significant  impact  of  such 

violations  (e.g.  in  case  of  falsification  or  modification  of  the  TC  String),  the  Litigation 

Chamber considers that the announcement of this initiative to increase its compliance with 

one of its obligations as a data controller  for  the TCF and consisting of audits of  adtech 

vendors on the Global Vendors List demonstrates that the TCF was not compliant with the 

defendant’s safety obligations, including the obligation to mitigate damage suffered by data 

subjects. No other actions were communicated by the defendant to the Litigation Chamber 

in this respect. 

552.  Furthermore, the Litigation Chamber is no longer in a position to review the nature of this 

programme  and,  in  any  event,  this  new  programme  does  not  change  the  nature  of  the 

breaches of the GDPR that occurred until the closure of the debates in June 2021. 

553.  In light of article 83.2.e of the GDPR, the Litigation Chamber notes the absence, at the time 

of the present decision, of any final decision by other competent supervisory authorities, 

regarding previous relevant infringements by the defendant in relation to the TCF.  

554.  Article  83.2.f  of  the  GDPR  concerns  the  degree  of  cooperation  with  the  supervisory 

authority, in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of 

the  infringement.  In  this  regard,  the  Litigation  Chamber  disagrees  with  the  Inspection 

Service’s finding that the defendant did not cooperate sufficiently with the former, apart 

from the provision  and submission of records  of processing  activities conducted by IAB 

Europe. 

555.  Insofar  as  the  categories  of  personal  data  affected  by  the  infringement  are  concerned 

(Article 83.2.g of the GDPR), the Litigation Chamber acknowledges that the personal data 

contained in and processed by means of the TC String are in adequacy with the principle of 

data  minimisation,  having  regard  to  their  nature.  Notwithstanding  the  previous,  the 

Litigation Chamber reiterates its position that the TCF plays a pivotal role in supporting the 

processing  operations  based  on  the  OpenRTB  protocol.  Hence,  the  Litigation  Chamber 

concludes that it cannot exclude that both special and regular categories of personal data

its  website,  on  26  August  2021: 

122 

—processed by means of a bid request to which the TC String is attached— may be affected 

by the infringements that occurred under the TCF. 

556.  With regard to article 83.2.h of the GDPR, the Litigation Chamber notes that this criterion is 

not relevant to the present case.  

557.  Article 83.2.i of the GDPR is not applicable in the absence of any previous final decision in 

this regard, taken against the defendant.  

558.  Article  83.2.j  of  the  GDPR  concerns  the  adherence  to  approved  codes  of  conduct  or 

approved  certification  mechanisms.  In  this  context,  the  Litigation  Chamber  notes  that 

IAB Europe  has  previously  been  in  contact  with  the  Belgian  Data  Protection  Authority 

concerning the drafting and adoption of a Code of Conduct (at the point of time when the 

proceedings were already pending). The Litigation Chamber also underlines the absence of 

follow-up by the defendant in this regard since June 2020, without any further explanation 

by the defendant.  

559.  Lastly,  article  83.2.k  of  the  GDPR  refers  to  any  other  aggravating  or  mitigating  factor 

applicable  to  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  such  as  financial  benefits  gained,  or  losses 

avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement. The Litigation Chamber did not retain 

specific factors that would change the amount of the fine.  

560.  In determining the amount of the administrative fine, article 83.3 to 83.7 GDPR use the term 

“undertaking”, which, based on Recital 150 of the GDPR and as confirmed by the WP29 and 

the EDPB254, should be understood in accordance with articles 101 and 102 TFEU. Based on 

CJEU  case  law,  the  term  undertaking  in  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU  refers  to  a  single 

economic unit (SEU), even if this economic unit is legally formed from several natural or legal 

persons255. 

561.  To assess whether several entities form a SEU, the ability of the individual entity to take free 

decisions  should  be  taken  into  account.  It  should  also  be  considered  whether  a  leading 

entity  (the  parent  company),  exercises  decisive  influence  over  the  other  entity  or  not 

(examples of criteria are the amount of the participation, personnel or organizational ties, 

instructions and the existence of company contracts). 

562.  The Litigation Chamber could not find any indication of decisive influence from IAB Inc. over 

the defendant IAB Europe, or limitation of freedom of its decision with respect to IAB Inc. 

 

 

254 Article-29-Working Party – Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the 
Regulation  2016/679  (WP  253)  and  confirmed  by  the  EDPB  in Endorsement  1/2018  on  25  May  2018;  as  well  as  EDPB 
Binding Decision 1/2021, para. 292.

paragraph  21,  and  CJUE  Judgment  of  14  December  2006,  Confederación  Española  de  Empresarios  de  Estaciones  de 
Servicio, C-217/05,  ECLI:EU:C:2006:784, para. 40  

123 

563.  This was also developed by the defendant in its response to the sanction form, wherein IAB 

Europe  claims  that  IAB  Inc.  has  no  ownership  stake  in  the  defendant  nor  any  say  in  the 

deployment  of 

IAB  Europe’s  activities.  The  defendant 

indicated  that 

IAB 

Inc. 

(headquartered in the USA) licenses the “IAB” brand to other organizations, and remains an 

entirely separate and independent entity from IAB Europe. 

564.  The Litigation Chamber therefore decides to base its decision on the sole financial revenues 

of  IAB  Europe  as  reference  for  calculating  the  administrative  fine,  instead  of  the  annual 

turnover of IAB Inc.  

565.  In  this  regard,  the  Litigation  Chamber  takes  note  that  the  annual  gross  benefits  of  the 

defendant  amounted  to  EUR  2.471.467  in  2020256.  As  a  subsidiary  point,  the  Litigation 

Chamber also observes that participating organisations are required to pay an annual fee of 

1.200 EUR to the defendant upon their registration to the TCF257. Having regard to the total 

number of registered TCF adtech vendors, which has significantly increased from 420 on 

25 May 2020 to 744 on 7 June 2021, the Litigation Chamber thus finds that a large part of 

the income of IAB Europe is generated through the licensing of the TCF. More specifically, 

IAB  Europe  would  make  a  gross  profit  of  at  least  981.600  EUR  for  2021  with  the  TCF 

participants’ annual fee — including both the adtech vendors and the CMPs258 — alone. 

566.  Under Article 83.4, infringements of articles 25, 30, 32, 35 and 37 GDPR may amount to up 

to 10.000.000 EUR or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 2% of the total annual worldwide 

turnover of the preceding business year. 

567.  Under 83.5 GDPR, infringements of articles 5.1.a, 5.1.f, 6, and 12 to 14 GDPR may amount to 

up  to  20.000.000  EUR  or,  in  the  case  of  an  undertaking,  up  to  4%  of  the  total  annual 

worldwide turnover of the preceding business year. The maximum amount of the fine in this 

case, as provided for in Article 83.5, is therefore 20.000.000 EUR. 

568.  As  these  are,  among  other  things,  infringements  of  a  fundamental  right  enshrined  in 

Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the assessment of 

their seriousness based on Article 83.2.a GDPR will be made in an autonomous manner. 

569.  Based  on  the  elements  developed  above,  the  defendant's  reaction  to  the  proposed 

sanction  form, as well  as  the  criteria listed in Article 83.2  GDPR, the  Litigation Chamber 

considers that the above-mentioned infringements justify to impose a compliance order in 

conjunction with an administrative fine of 250.000 EUR (Article 100, § 1 er, 13° and 101 DPA 

Act)  on  the  defendant,  as  an  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  sanction  in  light  of 

 

 

256 See Annual Accounts 21/12/2020, available at https://cri.nbb.be/bc9/web/catalog?execution=e1s1. 
257 https://iabeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TCF-Fact-Sheet_General.pdf 
258 Totalling 74 CMPs on June 7th, 2021: https://iabeurope.eu/cmp-list/. The actual profit is likely to be higher, considering 
the still increasing number of TCF participants.   

124 

Article 83 GDPR. In fixing this amount, the Litigation Chamber took into account the annual 

business volume of the defendant, which amounted to 2.471.467 EUR in 2020259. 

570. The  amount  of  EUR  250.000  EUR  remains,  in  view  of  the  aforementioned  elements,

proportionate to the infringements that have been established by the Litigation Chamber.

This amount is also much lower than the maximum amount of 20.000.000 EUR provided

for by Article 83.5 GDPR.

571. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that a lower fine would not meet, in  the present

case, the criteria required by Article 83.1 of the GDPR, according to which the administrative

fine  must  not  only  be  proportionate,  but  also  effective  and  dissuasive.  These  elements

derive  from  the  principle  of  loyal  cooperation  described  in  Recital  13  GDPR  (in  line  with

Article 4.3 of the Treaty on the European Union).

572.

In view of the importance of transparency regarding the decision-making process of the

Litigation Chamber and in accordance with Article 100, §1, 16° of the DPA Act, this decision

is  published  on  the  website  of  the  Data  Protection  Authority260.    Having  regard  to  the

previous publicity surrounding this case, as well as the general interest to the public, also in

view  of  the  a  large  number  of  data  subjects  and  organisations  involved,  the  Litigation

Chamber has decided not to delete the direct identification data of the parties and persons

mentioned, whether natural or legal persons.

FOR THESE REASONS,  

the Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation, to:  

-  order the defendant, pursuant to Article 100(1)(9) of the DPA  Act, with a view to  bring  the 

processing of personal data within the context of the TCF in line with the provisions of the 

GDPR, by:  

a.  providing a valid legal basis for the processing and dissemination of users' preferences 

within the context of the TCF, in the form of a TC String and a euconsent-v2 cookie, as 

well as prohibiting, via the terms of use of the TCF, the reliance on legitimate interests as 

a legal ground for the processing of personal data by organisations participating in the 

TCF in its current form, pursuant to Articles 5.1.a and 6 of the GDPR; 

b.  ensuring  effective  technical  and  organisational  monitoring  measures  in  order  to 

guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the TC String, in accordance with Articles 

5.1.f, 24, 25 and 32 of the GDPR; 

c.  maintaining  a  strict  audit  of  organisations  that  join  the  TCF  in  order  to  ensure  that 

participating  organisations  meet  the  requirements  of  the  GDPR,  in  accordance  with 

Articles 5.1.f, 24, 25 and 32 of the GDPR; 

d.  taking technical and organisational measures to prevent consent from being ticked by 

default  in  the  CMP  interfaces  as  well  as  to  prevent  automatic  authorisation  of 

participating  vendors  relying  on  legitimate  interest  for  their  processing  activities,  in 

accordance with Articles 24 and 25 of the GDPR; 

e.  forcing CMPs to adopt a uniform and GDPR-compliant approach to the information they 

submit to users, in accordance with Articles 12 to 14 and 24 of the GDPR; 

f.  updating  the  current  records  of  processing  activities,  by  including  the  processing  of 

personal data in the TCF by IAB Europe, in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR; 

 

126 

g. carrying  out  a  data  protection  impact  assessment  (DPIA)  with  regard  to  the

processing activities under the TCF and their impact on the processing activities

carried  out  under  the  OpenRTB  system,  as  well  as  adapting  this  DPIA  to  future

versions  or  amendments  to  the  current  version  of  the  TCF,  in  accordance  with

Article 35 of the GDPR;

h. appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in accordance with Articles 37 to 39 of 

the GDPR.

These  compliance  measures  should  be  completed  within  a  maximum  period  of  six 

months  following  the  validation  of  an  action  plan  by  the  Belgian  Data  Protection 

Authority, which shall be submitted to the  Litigation Chamber within two months after 

this decision. Pursuant to Article 100 § 1er, 12° of the DPA Act, a penalty payment of 5.000 

EUR per day will  be due in case of failure to  comply  within the  above-mentioned  time 

limits. 

-

impose an administrative fine of 250.000 EUR on the defendant pursuant to Article 101

of the DPA Act.

This decision may be appealed before the Market Court, pursuant to Article 108(1) of the DPA 

Act, within a period of thirty days from its notification, with the Data  Protection Authority as 

defendant.
