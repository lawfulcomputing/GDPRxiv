Austrian Supervisory Authority – Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
General  information:  It  should  be  taken  into  account  that  all  answers  were  given  by  the  data 
controllers, but not by the data protection officers. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
Please select five main issues (you may choose to list between 5 and 10 issues at most) you have 
identified in your investigations. These issues may be related, for instance, to one of the categories 
and sub-categories below:  

the designation, knowledge and experience of the DPO, 
the tasks and resources of the DPO,  
the role and position of the DPO, 
guidance of the Supervisory Authority. 

 
For each of the 5 to 10 main issues you identified1:  

Name the issue and briefly describe the main issue(s) identified.  
Which provision(s) of the GDPR (or national laws) does this concern? 
Explain why this has been an issue for the organisation? 
What  are  differences  that  you  have  encountered  between  organisations  in  your 
Member State?  
What are possible solutions to this issue?2 

 
The investigation of the Austrian banking sector did not identify any significant problems with regard 
to the role of DPOs.  
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
The  guidelines  of  the EDPB  on  the  DPO  have  been available  on  the  website of  the  Austrian  Data 
Protection Autority since they existed. 
 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 

                                                           
1 Note: for each issue, the five questions above are answered in approximately 1 page (and up to 2 pages) for 
each identified issue.  
2 Please note that the wording of this question has not been included in full in the following national reports. 
Many authorities have used the order of the subquestions 1 to 5 to respond to this question. 

3 

 

the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
In recent years - especially before the GDPR came into force - there has been a lot of informal contact 
with controllers regarding the design of the role of the DPOs. It is no longer possible to determine 
today whether the eleven controllers we examined were involved. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
This is not decided yet, but since no significant problems could be identified concerning the DPOs of 
the banking sector, no major actions by the Austrian Supervisory Authority will probably be necessary 
in this regard. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Essentially, the investigations revealed that all eleven banks examined take the role of the DPO very 
seriously.  Those  controllers  provide  sufficient  funds  to  enable  them  to  carry  out  their  tasks 
independently. The DPOs are also regularly involved in the relevant decision-making processes of the 
controller. The impression is also given that the advice of the DPOs is listened to and that their regular 
reports are taken seriously by the management level.  
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 

3.  Are there any leading practices of the organisations you have contacted that you would like to 

 

share?

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) DPO for multiple organisations 
 
Nearly half of the respondents indicated that they act as the single DPO for a group of undertakings or 
for several authorities or bodies.  
 
According to Article 37(2) of the GDPR, ‘a group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection 
officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment’. Article 
37(3) of the GDPR provides that ‘Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a 
single data protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account 
of their organisational structure and size’. 
 
Given the high proportion of DPOs acting as single DPO for a group of undertakings or for several public 
authorities or bodies, it is important to stress that the DPO must nevertheless remain accessible to 
data subjects, the supervisory authority and within the organisation itself and be able to fully carry out 
the tasks the GDPR assigns to the function for each of the organisations it has been appointed to. 
 
It is essential that the contact details of the DPO be easily available to data subjects, the supervisory 
authority and to employees of the organisation and the DPO should also, in some circumstances, be 
able to rely on a team or a deputy. 
 
2) Expertise in data protection  

10%  of  the  respondents  indicated  that  no  particular  expertise  on  data  protection  was  set  as  a 
requirement for the role of DPO but that the designation was compulsory. In addition, 19.2% of the 
respondents  indicated  that  the  DPO  has  less  than  2  years’ experience  on the application  and  the 
interpretation of data protection requirements. Finally, only 73.32% of the respondents indicated that 
‘expert knowledge of data protection regulation’ was set as a requirement for the role of DPO. 

Article 37(5) of the GDPR stipulates that ‘The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis 
of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and 
the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39’. 
 
Recital 97 provides that the necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined according to 
the data processing operations carried out and the protection required for the personal data being 
processed. 
 
The DPO should be chosen carefully, with due regard to the complexity, sensitivity and number of data 
protection issues that arise within the organization. In any event, as specified in the Article 29 Working 

 

5 

Party Guidelines on data protection officers3 (hereafter, ‘Guidelines on DPOs’), ‘Although Article 37(5) 
does not specify the professional qualities that should be considered when designating the DPO, it is a 
relevant element that DPOs must have expertise in national and European data protection laws and 
practices and an in-depth understanding of the GDPR. It is also helpful if the supervisory authorities 
promote adequate and regular training for DPOs’. 
 
3) Insufficient resources / Training 
 
46.88% respondents indicated that the resources allocated to the DPO are not sufficient. 
 
There is a considerable difference between the answers of the public and the private sector as 61.3% 
of the respondents from the public sector consider that their resources are not sufficient while 33.3% 
of the respondents from the private sector regard that their resources are not sufficient. 
 
In addition, the respondents indicated that they have the following hours of training per year in order 
to develop and/or maintain their professional qualities and expert knowledge on data protection law 
and practices: 

a.  0 hours: 16 (3.99%)  
b.  1–8 hours per year: 33 (8.23%) 
c.  9–16 hours per year: 50 (12.47%) 
d.  17–24 hours per year: 32 (7.98%) 
e.  25–32 hours per year: 55 (13.72%) 
f.  >32 hours per year: 174 (43.39%) 
g. 

I do not know or wish to answer 41 (10.22%) 

58.85% of the respondents answered that the organisation has not allocated a budget to the DPO. 
 
Article 38(2) of the GDPR stipulates that ‘The controller and processor shall support the data protection 
officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out 
those tasks (…), and to maintain his or her expert knowledge’. 
 
As indicated in the Guidelines on DPOs, depending on the nature of the processing operations and the 
activities and size of the organisation, the following resources should be provided to the DPO: 

Sufficient time for DPOs to fulfil their duties.  

- 
-  Adequate  support  in  terms  of  financial  resources,  infrastructure  (premises,  facilities, 

-  Continuous training in data protection and other forms of professional development, such as 

equipment) and staff where appropriate. 

participation in privacy fora, workshops, etc. 

-  Given the size and structure of the organisation, it may be necessary to set up a DPO team.  

 
Particular attention should be awarded to this issue by public sector organisations, given the high 
number of DPOs in the public sector who consider that the resources allocated are insufficient. 
 
4) Independence of the DPO / Conflict of interests 
 

                                                           
3 Guidelines on Data Protection Officers ('DPOs') (wp243rev.01) of 13 December 2016, last revised and adopted 
on 5 April 2017.

The respondents indicated that the DPO also has the following additional tasks/roles:  

IT or information security: 75 (18.7%) 

a.  Management: 47 (11.72%) 
b. 
c.  Legal or compliance: 95 (23.69%) 
d.  Other expert role: 72 (17.96%) 
e.  Any other office worker: 14 (3.49%) 
f.  Other: 90 (22.44%) 
g. 

I do not know or wish to answer: 75 (18.7%) 

 
In addition, the respondents answered that the following additional tasks are committed or assigned 
to the DPO: 

a.  Decision-making on the processing of personal data: 75 (18.7%) 
b.  Developing the organisation’s data protection processes: 196 (48.88%) 
c.  Drafting and/or carrying out data protection impact assessments: 202 (50.37%) 
d.  Fulfilling the data subjects’ requests on their data protection rights: 290 (72.32%) 
e.  Drafting  and/or  negotiating  contracts  (e.g.,  data  processing  agreements):  248 

(61.85%) 

f.  Responsibility for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data: 102 (25.44%) 
g.  Other: 42 (10.47%) 
h. 

I do not know or wish to answer: 31 (7.73%) 

 
Article 38(6) of the GDPR provides that ‘The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. 
The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of 
interests’. 
 
The Guidelines on DPOs clearly indicate that ‘The absence of conflict of interests is closely linked to 
the requirement to act in an independent manner. Although DPOs are allowed to have other functions, 
they can only be entrusted with other tasks and duties provided that these do not give rise to conflicts 
of  interests’.  Organisations  are  called  upon  to  be  particularly  cautious  when  combining  the  DPOs 
function  with  other  roles  and  tasks,  in  particular  senior  management  positions  (but  also  other 
positions,  depending  on  the  organisational  structure  of  the  organisation).  More  than  11%  of  the 
respondents answered that they also had a management role.  
 
The Court of Justice of the European Union recently held in its judgment of 9 February 2023 in case 

C‑453/21 that ‘The determination of the existence of a conflict of interests, within the meaning of 

Article 38(6) of the GDPR, must be carried out, case by case, on the basis of an assessment of all the 
relevant circumstances, in particular the organisational structure of the controller or its processor and 
in the light of all the applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor’4. 
 
It is striking here that more than 18% of the respondents indicated that they take part in the decision-
making on the processing of personal data. In Case C-453/21, the Court held that ‘a DPO cannot be 
entrusted  with  tasks  or  duties  which  would  result  in  him  or  her  determining  the  objectives  and 
methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its processor. Under EU law or 
the law of the Member States on data protection, the review of those objectives and methods must 
be carried out independently by the DPO’5.

The organisations should take appropriate measures to ensure that DPOs may carry out their tasks 
independently and without conflicts of interests. Good practices in relation to this requirement are 
included in the Guidelines on DPOs (section 3.5). 
 
5) Involvement of the DPO 
 
57.11% of the respondents stated that the DPO is consulted on all processes relevant to processing of 
personal data, while 28.93% respondents indicated that they are consulted in some of processes only, 
and 10.22% indicated that they are not consulted on issues concerning data protection. 
 
Additionally,  the  respondents  stated  that  the  DPO  has  access  to  and  provided  with  sufficient 
information  on  issues  relating  to  data  protection  and  personal  data  processing  operations  in  the 
organisation: 

a.  All the time: 88 (21.95%) 
b.  Most of the time: 203 (50.62%) 
c.  Sometimes: 75 (18.7%) 
d.  Rarely: 26 (6.48%) 
e.  Never: 5 (1.25%) 
f. 

I do not know or wish to answer: 4 (1%) 

38.4% of the respondents indicated that the DPO is involved and/or consulted in handling and solving 
issues relating to the processing and protection of personal data in the organisation less than 49% of 
the time.  

The  respondents  answered  that  the  level  at  which  DPOs’  opinions  are  being  followed  within  the 
organisation is intermediate (22.44%), poor (3.49%) or very poor (1.25%). 

Article 38(1) of the GDPR provides that the controller and the processor shall ensure that the DPO is 
‘involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data’. 
Article 38(2) stipulates that the controller or processor shall ‘shall support the data protection officer 
in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing (…) access to personal data and processing 
operations (…)’. 
 
Organizations should ensure that DPOs are systematically informed and consulted before processing 
of personal data takes place as this eases compliance with the GDPR and promotes a privacy by design 
approach. 
 
The Guidelines on DPOs indicate that organizations should ensure that:  
 

The DPO is invited to participate regularly in meetings of senior and middle management.  

- 
-  His or her presence is recommended where decisions with data protection implications are 
taken. All relevant information must be passed on to the DPO in a timely manner in order to 
allow him or her to provide adequate advice.  
The opinion of the DPO must always be given due weight. In case of disagreement, the WP29 
recommends, as good practice, to document the reasons for not following the DPO’s advice.  
The DPO must be promptly consulted once a data breach or another incident has occurred.

6) Reporting to the highest management level 
17.71% of the respondents answered that the DPO is not expected to regularly report to the highest 
management level of the organisation.  

Article 38(3) of the GDPR stipulates that ‘The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest 
management level of the controller or the processor’. 

Given  that  the  DPO’s  tasks  is  to  inform  and  advise  the  controller  or  the  processor  of  their  data 
protection  obligations  pursuant  to  Article  39  of  the  GDPR,  regular  reporting  to  the  highest 
management level of the organisation should take place and organisations are expected to implement 
this. 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
The Belgian Commission for the Protection of Private Life (the BE SA’s predecessor) published the 
Recommendation  n°04/2017  of  24  May  2017  on  the  appointment  of  a  data  protection  officer  in 
accordance  with  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  in  particular  the  admissibility  of 
combining  this  function  with  other  functions,  including  that  of  security  advisor6  (only  available  in 
French and in Dutch). 
 
The BE SA’s website contains a page dedicated to DPOs7, with information relating to the designation 
and the role of the DPO.  
 
The BE SA published a toolkit for DPOs in 2020 that includes the following documents: 

- 

The 10 ground rules regarding the DPO8: these rules are intended to support controllers and 
and processors in fulfilling their DPO duties. 

-  Checklist for the DPO9 : a list intended to assist DPOs in their advisory role.  
-  A template to request the DPO’s opinion10: a template at the disposal of DPOs in order to seek 

comprehensive information from the controller or processor before providing an opinion. 

-  A  general  GPDR  presentation11  that  may  be  used  by  DPOs  as  a  starting  point  to  inform 

employees on data protection. 

 
The BE SA collaborated with a DPO organization and a university on an EU-funded project to set up an 
online platform to support DPOs (DPO-Connect). This project was successfully completed in 2022.

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
The Inspection Service of the BE SA systematically enquires on the designation and the role of the DPO 
in the context of its formal investigations. 
 
Several decisions relating to the designation and the role of the DPO have been adopted by the BE SA. 
Below is a non-exhaustive list of decisions that broach this topic: 
 

-  Decision n°15/2020 of 15 April 202012: the Litigation Chamber notably finds a violation of 
Article 37 of the GDPR, given that the defendant does not demonstrate that the DPO fulfils the 
quality requirements imposed by the GDPR, and a violation of Article 38 of the GDPR because 
the  defendant  cannot  demonstrate  that  it  guarantees  that  the  position  of  the  DPO  is 
sufficiently independent and able to report to the highest level of management. 

-  Decision n°18/2020 of 28 April 202013: in this case, the DPO was also responsible for the audit, 
risk and compliance departments. The Inspection Service had found in this case that the DPO 
was not in a position that was sufficiently protected from a conflict of interests (Article 38(6) 
of the GDPR) and that the DPO was not sufficiently associated in discussions relating to data 
breaches (Article 38(1) of the GDPR). The Litigation Chamber of the BE SA found that there was 
no violation of Article 38(1) of the GDPR in this case but that there was a violation of Article 
38(6)  of  the  GDPR  due  to  the  multiple  functions  of  the  DPO,  thus  entailing  a  conflict  of 
interests. This decision gave rise to numerous reactions and questions, both in Belgium and 
abroad, concerning the possibility of combining DPO duties with other functions within an 
organization. 

-  Decision  n°41/2020  of  29  July  202014:  although  it  is  not  the  object  of  the  complaint,  the 
Litigation  Chamber  of  the  BE  SA  recalls  that  Article  38(2)  of  the  GDPR  requires  that 
organizations support their DPOs by providing resources necessary to carry out [their] tasks 
and  access  to  personal  data  and  processing operations,  and  to maintain  his or  her  expert 
knowledge.  The  Litigation  Chamber  lists  various  aspects  that  should  be  taken  into 
consideration, notably active support of the DPO’s function by the management, sufficient 
time being allocated to the DPO to carry out their tasks, sufficient financial resources and 
infrastructure, etc. The Litigation Chamber also insists on the fact that the more complex and 
sensitive  the  processing  operations  are  and  the  more  data  processed,  the  greater  the 
resources that should be allocated to the DPO. The DPO must be able to carry out their duties 
effectively, and be provided with adequate resources in relation to the data processing carried 
out and the risks involved. 

-  Decision n°24/2021 of 19 February 202115: the Litigation Chamber of the BE SA found that 
given  that  the  DPO  provides  its  opinions  to  a  contact  person  within  the  defendant’s

organization and not to the highest management level, there is a violation of Article 38(3) of 
the GDPR.  

 

-  Decision n°21/2022 of 2 February 202216: the Litigation Chamber of the BE SA considered that 
the defendant should have appointed a DPO, in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR, given 
that  regular  and  systematic  observation  of  identifiable  users  on  a  large-scale  was  being 
performed by the defendant. It concluded that there was a violation of Article 37 GPDR in the 
case at hand. 

-  Decision n°162/2022 of 16 November 202217 the Litigation Chamber of the BE SA concluded 
that the controller had violated Articles 38(1) and 39(1) of the GDPR due to the fact that the 
DPO had not been sufficiently involved in several issues relating to data protection.  

-  Decision n°81/202318 of 22 June 2023: the Litigation Chamber of the BE SA noted that the 
function  of  DPO  and  security  advisor  are  performed  by  the  same  person.  The  Litigation 
Chamber pointed out that in the case C-453/21, the CJEU held that there may be a conflict of 
interests within the meaning of Article 38(6) of the GDPR when a DPO is entrusted with other 
missions  or  tasks  that  would  lead  them  to  determining  the  purposes  and  means  of  the 
processing of personal data with the data controller or processor. This must be verified on a 
case-by-case basis, with an assessment of all the relevant circumstances. 

-  Decision n°110/2023 of 9 August 202319: the Litigation Chamber of the BE SA found that the 
defendant, a local municipality that had used the services of an external DPO, was in breach 
of  Article  37(1)(a)  and  Article  37(7)  of  the  GDPR  due  to  the  way  in  which  the  DPO  was 
appointed,  the  manner  in  which  the  appointment  was  monitored  and  due  to  absence  of 
notification of the DPO to the BE SA. The Litigation Chamber also concluded that there had 
been a breach of Article 39(1) of the GDPR given the lack of an adequate working framework 
for the DPO. Several issues were identified, notably: insufficient time allocated to enable the 
DPO to perform its tasks (120 hours per year), absence or lack of direct contact with the highest 
management level. This was especially problematic given the large volume of personal data 
processed from a large number of data subjects by the controller.

Part IV – Other 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
There  seem to  be  disparities  in  the  level  of  compliance  with  the obligations  relating  to  the DPOs 
position and tasks among the respondents.  
 
In any event, there is still a lot of room for improvement and organisations should be made aware of 
the crucial role played by the DPO and encouraged to provide the necessary resources to their DPOs 
in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks and missions in compliance with the relevant 
provisions of the GDPR.

16.46% of the respondents indicated that the DPO was not appointed on the basis of Article 37(1) of 
the GDPR or in accordance with an obligation arising from another legislation of the Union or of a 
Member State, but ‘On another basis, for example on a voluntary basis’.  
 
As  indicated  in  the  Guidelines  on  Data  Protection  Officers  adopted  by  the  Working  Party  29,  the 
appointment of a DPO on a voluntary basis is to be encouraged.

Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
1) The designation, knowledge and experience of the DPO 

•  Deputy DPO 
1.  53% of the respondents have not appointed a deputy DPO.  
2.  Art. 38(1), (4), Art. 39(1) GDPR 
3. 

In case where the DPO cannot perform their duties, for a certain period of time and there is 
no deputy DPO, then both the communication with the data subjects for the exercise of their 
rights and the cooperation with the Supervisory Authority are significantly affected. 

4.  – 
5.  Designation of deputy DPO. 
 

2) The tasks and resources of the DPO  
•  DPO to multiple organizations 
1.  Some companies provide DPO services to multiple organizations.  
2.  Art. 38(1) GDPR 
3.  There are concerns whether the DPOs are able to fulfil their duties effectively for each one of 

these organizations. 

4.  – 
5.  Dedicated person in the company for each organization. 
 

3) The role and position of the DPO 

•  Position in the management of the organization 
1.  13%  of  the  designated  DPOs  belong  to  the  highest  management  or  the  administrative 

management of the organization.  

2.  Art. 38(6) GDPR 
3.  DPOs cannot be in a position to determine the scope and means of processing. Such case may 

cause a conflict of interest. 

4.  – 
5.  Employees who belong to the administration of the organization must be excluded from being 

designated as DPOs. 

 

 

13 

 

 

4) Publication of the contact details 

1.  14%  of  the  respondents  have  not made  public  the contact  details  of  their DPOs  nor  have 

communicated them to the Supervisory Authority. 

2.  Art. 37(7) GDPR 
3.  Both  the  communication  with  the  data  subjects  for  the  exercise  of  their  rights  and  the 

cooperation with the Supervisory Authority are adversely affected. 

4.  – 
5.  Provision of specific guidelines by the Supervisory Authority. 

 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
Yes, our Supervisory Authority has published guidance on its website regarding DPOs, in the form of 
questions and answers and other supporting material, including explanation of the provisions of the 
relevant Articles of the GDPR and based on the EDPB Guidelines. The aim was the understanding of 
the obligations of the data controllers, derived from the GDPR, including the tasks of the DPOs. 

This guidance has been published prior to the launch of this coordinated action at the following link: 
https://www.dataprotection.gov.cy/dataprotection/dataprotection.nsf/page2b gr/page2b gr?open
document.  

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Through the years, many seminars/presentations have been held in both private and public sector, 
regarding the GDPR in general, including the role and tasks of the DPOs.  
 
Also, we contact many organizations and requested to provide the contact details of their DPOs, in 
order to update our database. 
 
Furthermore, in 2022, at the Ministry of Finance, a special training on the GDPR, for DPOs in public 
sector was organized. 
 
The  same year,  the  Commissioner organized  two  seminars/presentations  in which  more  than 200 
officials, supervisors and high-ranking officials of the House of Representatives, Ministries, Deputy 
Ministries, Departments, Services, Independent Offices and Authorities participated. 
 
In 2020, in order to assess the level of compliance of the private sector (supermarkets, insurance 
companies and private hospitals) our Office started conducting sector audits through a questionnaire. 
The aim of these controls was, inter alia, the designation and tasks of the DPOs.  

 

14 

 
In 2019, our Office conducted audits, through a questionnaire, in public sector (Departments, Services, 
Public Law Legal Entities, Local Government Organizations). The main objective of the audit was to 
investigate whether  the  public  sector  has  responded  sufficiently  in  their obligations  regarding  the 
designation of the DPOs and if they have been given to the person designated to carry out the due 
duties, the appropriate resources for the exercise of their duties, with full independence. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
Our Office aims to communicate, with both public and private organizations in order to provide specific 
guidelines  regarding  the  main  issues  identified  based  on  the  results  of  the  coordinated  action. 
Although we have already provided guidelines on the designation and the role of the DPO, the results 
of the questionnaire showed specific topics that need further guidance. The said guidance will be 
published after the final report by the EDPB.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
Question 17 

1.  The survey has shown that three out of fourteen ministries stated that their DPOs were tasked 
with drafting and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as an additional 
task. 

2.  Art. 35(2), Art. 38(6) GDPR. 
3.  The survey has shown that three out of fourteen ministries stated that their DPOs were tasked 
with drafting and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment as an additional task. For 
clarity the SA would like to point out that the Czech version of the questionnaire featured a 
question with phrasing that explicitly implied a creation of a DPIA. Considering the fact that 
DPOs  are  supposed  to  merely  provide  assistance,  in  the  form  of  providing  advice,  to  the 
controller who carries out a DPIA it could be said that if they were to simultaneously draft-up 
DPIA itself and carry it out instead of the controller they would end up in a conflict of interest. 
As  was  stated  in  Guidelines  on  Data  Protection  Officers  (‘DPOs’),  controllers  are  the  ones 
obliged to carry out a DPIA, not DPOs themselves. This finding could indicate a violation of 
Article 38(6) GDPR. 
In the remaining responses the ministries haven’t stated that their DPOs were tasked with 
drafting and carrying out a DPIA as an additional task. 
It  is  not  possible  to  conclude  that  GDPR  has  been  violated  purely  based  on  the  answers 
provided in the survey. The solution to indicated violation of GDPR could lay in utilising the 
investigative powers bestowed upon SA by Article 58(1)(d) GDPR and notifying the controller 
of an alleged infringement of GDPR, especially in cases where a DPIA was actually carried out. 

4. 

5. 

 
Question 27  

1.  The survey has shown that eleven out of fourteen of responding ministries do not include their 

DPO in every issue concerning personal data protection. 

2.  Art. 38(1) GDPR. 
3.  The survey has shown that eleven out of fourteen of responding ministries do not include their 
DPO in every matter concerning personal data protection. Any answer other than that the DPO 
is included in all matters concerning personal data protection indicates a violation of Article 
38(1) GDPR. One ministry even stated that their DPO is involved in less than 5 % of matters 
concerning personal data protection. Such answer indicates a general lack of effectiveness of 
DPO’s position within the ministry and a question arises as to whether this lack of effectiveness 
shows up in the level of personal data protection provided by the ministry in question. 

4.  Three ministries have stated that their DPO is involved in all matters concerning personal data 

protection. 

 

16 

5. 

It  is  not  possible  to  conclude  that  GDPR  has  been  violated  purely  based  on  the  answers 
provided in the survey. A possible solution would be to hold an audit focused on the inclusion 
of DPOs in matters concerning personal data protection. 

 
Question 28 
1.  The  survey  has  shown  that  three  out  of  fourteen  responding  ministries  do  not  require  a 
consultation with the DPO on the issues concerning data protection, such as cases of personal 
data breaches, in their internal processes. 

2.  Art. 38(1) GDPR. 
3.  The  survey  has  shown  that  three  out  of  fourteen  responding  ministries  do  not  require  a 
consultation with the DPO on the issues concerning data protection, such as cases of personal 
data breaches, in their internal processes. Even if this is not an obligation explicitly required by 
GDPR it is recommended by Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (‘DPOs’). It should be noted 
that this group of three ministries includes a ministry that stated that their DPO has access to 
all information in relation to personal data protection only rarely in a follow-up question. In 
context of this situation the answer may indicate that their DPO isn’t included in all matters 
concerning personal data protection. This can therefore indicate a violation of Art. 38(1) GDPR. 
Other five respondents have stated that their internal processes require a consultation with 
DPO only in certain cases, which can also indicate that their DPO isn’t included in all matters 
concerning personal data protection. 

4.  The survey has shown that the remaining six out of fourteen respondents have stated that 
their internal processes require a consultation with DPO in all matters concerning personal 
data protection. 

5.  SA will probably approach ministries through a letter that will aim to advise ministries to take 

best practise included in Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (‘DPOs‘)in mind. 

Question 29 
1.  The survey has shown that twelve out of fourteen responding ministries have stated that their 
DPO  does  not  always  have  a  sufficient  access  to  information  on  issues  relating  to  data 
protection and personal data processing operations in the organisation.  

2.  Art. 38(1)(2) GDPR. 
3.  The survey has shown that twelve out of fourteen responding ministries have stated that their 
DPO  does  not  always  have  a  sufficient  access  to  information  on  issues  relating  to  data 
protection and personal data processing operations in the organisation. Ten of the responding 
ministries have stated that their DPO has access to all information regarding personal data 
processing  most  of  the  time  for  the  most  part.  These  answers  already  indicate  a  possible 
violation  of  Article  38  (1)(2) GDPR  because  the  DPO  should  always  be  included  in matters 
relating  to  personal  data  protection  in  a  proper  and  timely  manner  by  the  organisation. 
Especially in a case of one answer out of this group of twelve which included that their DPO 
has access to all information regarding personal data processing only rarely a flagrant violation 
GDPR is alluded to and this raises the question of how well is their DPO capable of performing 
their  tasks.  It should  be  noted that  in the  case of this  ministry  the  questionnaire  was  not 
actually filled out by a DPO. 

4.  The survey has shown that only two ministries have stated that their DPO always has access to 
all information regarding personal data protection. It should be noted that in these two cases 
the questionnaire was filled out by a DPO. 

17 

 

 

5.  The solution to the indicated violation of GDPR could lay in utilising the investigative powers 
entrusted to supervisory authorities in Article 58 (1)(d) GDPR or in performing an audit with 
focus on the DPO’s access to information relating to personal data protection and personal 
data processing and possibly in ordering the ministries to ensure the necessary conditions for 
the DPOs to perform their duties independently. Precise course of action will be determined 
in due time. 

 
Question 31 
1.  The survey has shown that nine of the fourteen responding ministries have stated that their 

reasons for not following their DPO’s advice is not documented. 

2.  Art. 38(1) GDPR. 
3.  The survey has shown that nine ministries have stated that they don’t document in any way 
their  reasons  for  not  following  their  DPO’s  advice  in  matters  concerning  personal  data 
protection. Even if this is not an obligation explicitly required by GDPR it is recommended by 
Guidelines  on  Data  Protection  Officers  (‘DPOs’).  An  absence  of  such  procedure  can  be 
indicative of the possible fact, that other interests of the organisation are preferred instead of 
fully adhering to provision of GDPR regarding DPO. On the other hand, it is necessary to say 
that the survey has also shown that seven ministries have stated that they follow their DPO’s 
opinions, and seven ministries have stated that their DPO’s opinions are followed most of the 
time. It is not possible to get a clear picture of the number of times the ministries have decided 
not to follow their DPO’s opinions from the survey alone. 

4.  The survey has shown that no ministry documents their reasons for not following their DPO’s 
opinions in all cases. One ministry has answered that their reasons for not following their DPO’s 
advice are documented most of the time. 

5.  SA will probably approach ministries through a letter that will aim to advise ministries to take 

best practise included in Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (‘DPOs‘) in mind. 

 
Question 32 
1.  The survey has shown that one of the fourteen responding ministries has stated that they give 

their DPO instructions regarding the exercise of their tasks. 

2.  Art. 38(3) GDPR. 
3.  The survey has shown that one of the fourteen ministries has stated that they give their DPO 
instructions regarding the exercise of their task. According to Article 38 (3) GDPR the controller 
shall ensure that the DPO does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those 
tasks. The requirement of independence associated with DPOs position is not any different for 
employees  of  ministries.  This  finding  indicates  a  violation  of  the  duty  to  ensure  DPO’s 
independence and therefore indicates a violation of Article 38 (3) GDPR. It can be said that all 
ministries  have  answered  that  none  of  their  DPOs  has  been  dismissed  or  penalised  for 
performing their tasks and duties. 
In the remaining thirteen cases the ministries have answered that they do not give their DPOs 
instructions  regarding  the  exercise  of  their  tasks.  The  singular  exception  in  this  group  of 
thirteen was an answer stating that the ministry does so in area of cyber security. It is not clear 
whether the DPO in question of this ministry isn’t also entrusted with a different task or a role 
within the organisation, however it should be noted that the ministry in question has also 
stated that their DPO performs their role as a full-time job. 

4. 

5.  The solution to the aforementioned violation of GDPR could lay in utilising the investigative 
powers entrusted to supervisory authorities in Article 58 (1)(d) GDPR or in performing an audit 

18 

 

 

with focus on independence of the DPO’s position and after answering the questions of fact 
ordering the ministry to ensure that their DPO will not receive any instruction regarding the 
exercise of their tasks. Precise course of action will be determined in due time. 

 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
The  Supervisory  authority  (SA)  has  not  published  any  general  guide  focused  on  DPOs.  The  most 
important information is available on SA’s web page in form of an FAQ. 
 
SA started to organise a series of specialised educational events during the year 2018, seven of which 
were  meant  specifically  for  DPOs  employed  by  public  authorities  and  bodies.  These  educational 
activities were eventually halted due to COVID-19 pandemic. SA resumed organising such events in 
June 2023. The topic of last-held event so far was Data Protection Impact Assessment. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
SA has also concerned itself with DPO’s position and conditions for fulfilling their duties during audits 
of ministries in cases where it related to the subject of the audit itself.  
 
Specifically in case of an audit that SA has held at Ministry of foreign affairs, which finished in the year 
2021, during which SA discovered a violation of Article 38(1)(2) GDPR. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
Action of SA is going to be derived from findings acquired from individual ministries. SA presumes that 
individual ministries will be informed according to investigative power bestowed by Article 58 (1)(d) 
GDPR about the fact that their answers in the questionnaire indicate a possible violation of GDPR. At 
the same time, they will be ordered to relay more concrete information in accordance with Article 31 
GDPR. In some cases, it will be possible to think about initiating an audit in accordance with Art. 58 
(1)(b) GDPR instead of the previously mentioned approach. As a response to further findings, the SA 
will then start to give corrective orders. It needs to be said that due to Article 83(7) GDPR and section 
§ 62 subsection 5 Act No. 110/2019 Coll., on personal data processing, it’s impossible to impose an 
administrative fine on public authorities and bodies for violating GDPR. 
 
 

 

19 

Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Based  on  results  of  the  questionnaire  SA  has  an  opinion  that  it  is  possible  to  observe  significant 
differences within a relatively homogenous group of entities such as ministries in terms of how they 
create an environment for their DPO’s position and related affairs. SA believes that these differences 
can exist partially due to different ways these ministries fulfil their various agenda and from which 
varying parameters of personal data processing may stem. Nonetheless, vast majority of requirements 
have their origin in GDPR itself and are therefore same for all ministries, such as the requirement to 
involve  DPOs  in  every  matter  concerning  personal  data  processing,  and  their  lack  of  proper 
implementation cannot be substantiated solely by a possible difference in parameters of personal data 
processing. As can be concluded from information mentioned above the answers of ministries often 
indicate a violation of GDPR’s provisions focused on DPOs in itself or in sum of their parts. In SA’s 
opinion the position of DPO and ensuring resources for their tasks in ministries is not aided by the fact 
that the Czech legislative in Act No. 110/2019 Coll. in its section § 62 subsection 5 in accordance with 
Article  83(7)  GDPR  has  utilised  the  possibility  of  exempting  public  authorities  and  bodies  from 
sanctions by not allowing the SA to impose an administrative fine.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
We  are  still  in  an  ongoing  process  of  investigation  and  asking  further  explanations  from  the 
organisations, where we identified possible violations. 
Therefore the listing of the substantive issues we identified should be considered as the current state 
of which issues we're expecting as the final main issues after our investigation is fully done. 
1) DPO's tasks do not meet the minimum tasks defined by the GDPR 

1.  A significant number of organisations did not respond that all of the tasks in Question 16 are 
committed/assigned to the DPO, despite we would consider them all as tasks which should be 
committed/assigned to the DPO. 

2.  Art. 39(1) and 38(4) GDPR. 
3.  This  is  an  issue  as  the DPO  should  be  committed/assigned  to  all of the  tasks  the  GDPR  is 

defining. 

4.  Other organisations did respond that all of the tasks in Question 16 are committed/assigned 

to the DPO. 

5.  The organisations must ensure that all the tasks the GDPR is defining are committed /assigned 

to the DPO. 

2) Additional tasks are committed/assigned to the DPO, which are causing a conflict of interests 

1.  A  significant  number  of  organisations  did  respond  to  Questions  17  and  25  that  tasks  are 

committed/assigned to the DPO, which we would consider as a conflict of interests. 

2.  Art. 38(6) GDPR. 
3.  This  is  an  issue  as  tasks  which  are  causing  a  conflict  of  interests  are  forbidden  to  be 

committed/assigned to the DPO. 

4.  Other organisations did not reply with such tasks. 
5.  The organisations must ensure that additional tasks of the DPO are free of conflicts of interests. 

 
3) DPO has no designated deputy 

1.  Many organisations did respond to Question 21 that the DPO does not have a designated 
deputy. Despite this is not an obligation the GDPR explicitly demands, it is at least questioning, 
if the tasks of the DPO are sufficiently taken care of in case of the DPO being absent. 

2.  See response under point 1. 
3.  See response under point 1. 
4.  Other organisations stated that a deputy is designated. 

21 

 

5.  The matter requires further investigation on what other arrangements the organisations have 

established for the case of the DPO being absent. 

4) No independent budget allocated to the DPO 

1.  Many organisations responded to questions 23 and 24 that there is no budget allocated to the 

DPO or that the DPO cannot manage such budget independently. 

2.  Art. 38(2) GDPR. 
3.  While there might not automatically be a violation with those answers given, not having such 
budget or having limitations in managing it is at least questioning if the DPO is provided with 
sufficient resources. 

4.  There  were  also  several  organisations  which  answered  that  an  independent  budget  is 

allocated.  

5.  The matter requires further investigation on how the DPO is requesting financial resources 

from the organisation and how the processing of such requests is organised. 

5) Insufficient consultation, access and documentation 

1.  The answers of several organisations to questions 27, 28, 29 and 31 are indicating that the 
consultation of the DPO and its documentation is insufficient and the DPO does not have the 
required access to fulfil his tasks. 

2.  Art. 38(1) and (2) GDPR. 
3.  The DPO only can fulfil his tasks when he has the required access to do so and when he is 

getting involved in questions regarding the protection of personal data.  

4.  Most organisations might have at least one of these issues but there are also several which do 

not seem to have a problem here. 

5.  The matter requires further investigation on how the DPO is involved within the organisation 
but the aim must be that the organisations involve the DPO and grant him access like the GDPR 
demands. 

6) Overall resources 

1.  For several organisations we are in doubt if the overall resources (especially human resources) 
of the DPO are sufficient when we take a look for example at the number of employees and 
customers,  the  industry/sector  of  the  organisation  or  the  number  of  organisations  he  is 
assigned to as a group DPO. 

2.  Art. 38(2) GDPR. 
3.  Sufficient  resources  are  a  key  element  of  a  DPO  who  is  actually  capable  of  action.  If  the 
organisation limits those resources below the actual requirements, the DPO cannot fulfil his 
tasks sufficiently. 
It  is  not  yet  foreseeable  how  many  organisations  actually  have  a  problem  here  but  there 
definitely  also  are  organisations  where  we  would  consider  the  resources  in  a  sufficient 
proportion. 

4. 

5.  The matter requires further investigation for each individual organisation where we are in 

doubt of sufficient resources.

Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
We do not have general guidelines yet but only some FAQ and a general landing page on our website. 
This publication however requires revision and addition, which both is planned in the course of the 
coordinated action. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Prior  to  launching  the  coordinated  action,  some  of  the  contacted  organisations  in  the  past  have 
received individual advice to specific DPO-related questions or supervisory notices on specific matters 
like publication of the DPO's contact data. We are not aware of more serious actions according to 
Article 58(2) GDPR. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
We have not yet decided, what kind of further actions will be the most appropriate ones to promote 
the results of the CEF. We receive many questions on this aspect claiming that the Guidelines on DPOs 
should be updated as one of the key outcomes - a wish we strongly support. In the meantime, we will 
work on guidelines or FAQ's published by our authority or - in best case - supported by the other 
German SA's taking also into account current questions like the role of DPO's in the implementations 
of whistleblowing-systems  (currently a  question  because  the  national  implementation of Directive 
2019/1937 just entered into force; see below Part IV Nr. 2). Regardless of these measures, we are 
aiming at finishing our formal investigations case by case, expecting that this will take at least until 
mid-year 2024. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Notwithstanding further investigations, at first sight we look at structures and implementations of the 
concept of the DPO as an internal monitoring and advisory body that seem in line with the GDPR-
requirements. Looking at specific elements like resources, tasks, budget, additional tasks and functions 
or  the  way,  the  DPO  is  able  to  report  to  the  highest  management  level  reveals  in  several  cases 
misunderstandings and shortcoming of awareness, how a DPO should be integrated in the compliance 
mechanisms of companies. 

 

23 

 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 
We recently received several questions regarding recital 56 of so called Whistleblowing Directive (EU) 
2019/1937,  which  states  in  the  German  translation  of  the  Directive  that  the  DPO  of  smaller 
organisations is considered a suitable choice to be designated as competent to receive and follow up 
on reports under this this Directive. We however think that performing this specific task in relation to 
whistleblowing together with the tasks of a DPO is likely to lead to a conflict of interests on a regular 
basis. We would be interested to hear the opinions of other authorities about this matter.

if possible.

Danish Supervisory Authority – Danish Data Protection Agency 

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Conflict of interests 
The  DK  SA  noticed  a  relatively  large  number  of  controllers  outsourcing  the  DPO-role  to  external 
organisations, such as law firms. These law firms act as DPO for multiple different municipalities, and 
sometimes they take on advisory roles as well as handle legal cases for the municipalities. There is a 
risk  that  this  could  compromise  the  DPO’s  independence  and  ability  to  act  without  a  conflict  of 
interests, cf. Article 38(6) GPDR. 
 
2) Other tasks and duties 
Related to the first issue. A number of controllers mentioned that they had additional tasks beyond 
what was required by the GDPR. This is not in itself an issue, however, several indicated that they had 
tasks that would necessarily interfere with their other tasks as DPO’s, such as making decisions on the 
controller’s processing of personal data. This would also relate to Article 38(6) GPDR. 
 
3) Providing necessary resources 
Another issue identified is a lack of necessary resources relating to the condition in Article 38(2) GDPR. 
17% of the respondents said that they do not have the necessary resources to carry out the tasks of 
the DPO.  
 
4) Involvement of the DPO 
The survey has shown that only 4% of the respondents involve their DPO in all issues relating to the 
protection of personal data. Additionally, 16% responded that, according to their internal procedures, 
they are not required to involve the DPO in questions regarding data protection. These issues concern 
Article 38(1) GDPR. 
 
The  final  identified  challenges  will  be  part of our  ongoing  considerations  for starting  own-volition 
investigations. 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
Indeed, the Danish SA published guidelines on DPO’s in December 2017. The guidelines have a broad 
scope, and issues guidance on what a DPO is private organisations’ obligation to appoint a DPO, public 
authorities’ obligation to appoint a DPO as well as the role of the DPO. The Danish SA also has a link 
on  its  website  to  the  EDPB  guidelines  on  DPO’s.  Link  to  the  guidelines  (only  available  in  Danish 
unfortunately): https://www.datatilsynet.dk/Media/B/E/Databeskyttelsesr%c3%a5dgivere.pdf.

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Yes, we opened some own-volition inquiries into a couple of chosen municipalities regarding their 
DPO’s resources, tasks and qualifications. The inquiries were opened in 2019. In the end, the Danish 
Supervisory Authority did not consider the municipalities to have breached the GDPR, and thus no 
corrective measure was imposed upon the municipalities. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  coordinated  action,  the  Danish  SA  initiated  an  investigation  on  the 
outsourcing of the DPO-role. The aim is to make an overall assessment of whether the municipalities 
have implemented the necessary organizational structures in order to ensure that the DPO’s are able 
to perform their tasks, including ensuring the independence of the DPO. 
 
The investigations are initiated and will continue throughout the spring. 
 
The other issues could be alleviated either by more focused guidance on this matter, or by opening 
investigations. This will be considered by the Danish SA going forward. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Our general impression is that the levels of awareness and compliance among Danish municipalities is 
quite high. We have primarily seen positive answers to the questionnaire. However, there are some 
areas that obviously could be improved.

European Data Protection Supervisor 

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 

Issue No 1 - Tasks and resources 

1.  Brief description of the issue identified 

The main issue for DPOs seems to be a lack of resources. This translates both as a lack of time to 
perform their DPO duties, in particular for part-time DPOs, and as lack of additional staff resources. 
Almost half of the 69 respondents estimate that their resources are insufficient to fulfil their tasks. 
Less than half of the DPOs have a deputy and less than 30% have their own budget. 30% indicate that 
they do not have any full time equivalent (FTE) at their disposal for fulfilling their tasks and 40% only 
have a part-time resource. 
2.  Relevant provisions 

The relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data 
by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs) and on the free movement of such data, 
and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (EUDPR) are Article 44(2) 
and (6)20. 

3.  Why this has been an issue for EUIs 

If the DPOs do not have sufficient time and resources to perform their duties, there is a risk that data 
protection is not perceived as a priority by their EUI, and that the data protection culture must be 
further fostered. Even where this is not a conscious choice or a result of negative prioritisation by EUIs, 
it will inevitably have a negative impact on the internal application of the EUDPR.  

4.  Differences between EUIs 

The difference in size of the EUIs entails significant differences in resources; larger EUIs naturally have 
more staff to devote to DPO tasks and may even have a whole team supporting the DPO, whereas 
smaller EUIs often only have part-time DPOs that carry out other tasks in parallel to their DPO tasks. 
The  largest  EUIs  (European  Commission,  European  Parliament,  etc.)  also  have  appointed  Data 
Protection Coordinators who advise and assist a particular directorate-general or service in all data 
protection aspects, acting as delegated DPOs. Furthermore, there is a large disparity between the type 
of personal data processed by the different EUIs. While they all process administrative data relating to 
HR matters, contracts, etc., not all of them process personal data in their core business. Others, such 
as  Europol  and  Frontex,  process  large  amounts  of  sensitive  data  within  the  framework  of  their 
mandate. The workload and expertise required of DPOs therefore vary a lot from one EUI to another 
and are not necessarily related to the size of the EUI.  

5.  Possible solutions 

EUIs  can  be  encouraged  to  allocate  more  resources  to  the  DPO  function.  Having  a  strong  and 
independent DPO function that is capable of taking action and ensuring the internal application of the 
                                                           
20 Equivalent to Article 38(2) and (6) GDPR.  

27 

 

EUDPR,  should  be  seen  as  an  asset,  an  insurance  against  future  problems.  DPOs  should  also  be 
encouraged to inform the EDPS where there is an issue linked to resources, so that the EDPS can 
intervene if needed, for example by formally addressing the matter with senior management of the 
EUI in question.  

 

Issue No 2 - The role and position of the DPO  
1.  Brief description of the issue identified 

Independence of the DPO. A very small number, 3 out of 69 respondents, reported that they have been 
dismissed or penalised for performing their tasks and duties. 

2. 

 Relevant provisions 

Articles 44(3)21, 44(8) second sentence22 and 45(1)(b) first sentence23 EUDPR. 

3.  Why this has been an issue for EUIs  

Although the number of DPOs reporting having suffered serious negative consequences for carrying 
out their tasks and duties is small (4%) this is still cause for concern since the independence of the DPO 
cannot be guaranteed if they risk retaliation for performing their tasks. 

4.  Differences between EUIs 

N/A 

5.  Possible solutions 

More awareness-raising activities and information on the importance of the independence of the DPO 
could be envisaged, in particular directed at senior management. This could be followed by audits or 
investigations on the matter, possibly resulting in corrective measures if needed.  

 

Issue No 3 - Further guidance from EDPS  

1.  Brief description of the issue identified 

Almost all the DPOs requested further guidance from the EPDS, not specifically as to their tasks and 
role, probably because the awareness of these matters is already high within EUIs (the previous legal 
framework on data protection from 2001 also included an obligation to appoint a DPO).24 DPOs are in 
fact more interested in guidance to help them fulfil their tasks more efficiently and provide advice that 
is more impactful to data subjects and controllers within their organisation. The DPOs reported that 
they would like to receive such guidance both for themselves and for internal distribution within their 
EUI. 

2.  Relevant provisions 

Articles 45(1)25 EUDPR. 

                                                           
21 Equivalent to Article 38(3) GDPR. 
22 No equivalent in GDPR. This provision reads as follows: ‘(...) The data protection officer may be dismissed from 
the post by the Union institution or body which designated him or her if he or she no longer fulfils the conditions 
required for the performance of his or her duties and only with the consent of the European Data Protection 
Supervisor.’  

23 No equivalent in GDPR. it reads as follows: ‘1.(b) to ensure in an independent manner the internal application 

of this Regulation; (...)’. 

24 In light of the entry into force of the EUDR, the EDPS issued a Position Paper on the role of DPOs in EUIs on 30 
September 2018. This Position Paper built on the principles and recommendations in a previous paper from 
2005. 

25 The list of tasks of the DPO in Article 45 EUDPR is more elaborated than in Article 39 GDPR (see italics): ‘1.The 

data protection officer shall have the following tasks: 

 

28 

3.  Why this has been an issue for EUIs 

As many DPOs struggle with a lack of resources, they often find it difficult and time-consuming to set 
up procedures and create templates (for instance for DPIAs), whilst providing guidance on a wide range 
of complex data protection issues. As a large majority of DPOs report that they are involved in almost 
all the data protection related tasks listed in the questionnaire, they are required to be experts in many 
different aspects of data protection, both legal and IT-related. Many DPOs have also reported that they 
are asked to take on additional tasks, such as developing the organisation’s data protection processes, 
dealing with data subjects’ requests to exercise their rights, or drafting and negotiating contracts (e.g., 
data processing agreements).  

4.  Differences between EUIs 

Additional  guidance  is  an  almost  unanimous  request  from  DPO.  There  does  not  seem  to  be  any 
difference between EUIs, although the issues encountered would logically be more accentuated for 
DPOs with little resources. 
5.  Possible solutions 

In  addition  to  the  Position  Paper  on  DPOs,  the  EDPS  has  already  issued  extensive  guidance  for 
controllers and DPOs, such as thematic guidelines. Other tools made available to DPOs include: an 
annotated  EUDPR  (wiki);  training  sessions  (including  training  targeted  to  newly  appointed  DPOs); 
workshops; DPO roundtables (where a small number of DPOs and the EDPS discuss specific topics of 
interest for DPOs); factsheets; podcasts; Quick News for DPOs (a short monthly newsletter covering 
topics  of  interest  for  DPOs  with  a  practical  focus);  periodical  publications  (EDPS  newsletter, 
TechDispatch, TechSonar), etc.26  
Furthermore, the EDPS organises biannual meetings with the EU DPO network. Certain items on the 
agenda of these meetings are prepared in cooperation with the small group of DPOs (DPO Support 
Group). At these meetings, the EDPS organises workshops and case studies, together with the DPO 
Support Group, aimed at giving DPOs practical guidance on different topics. All the above tools and 
initiatives, contribute to provide support and guidance to DPOs. The EDPS intends to issue further 
guidance based on converging requests from DPOs on specific topics. This guidance could be given in 
the form of Q&As and FAQs, training material and documentation, both for the DPOs themselves and 
for  internal  distribution  within  their  EUI,  as  well  as  guidelines  and  online  and  dynamic  tools.  To 
                                                           
  (a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their 

obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union data protection provisions; 

  (b) to ensure in an independent manner the internal application of this Regulation; to monitor compliance with 
this Regulation, with other applicable Union law containing data protection provisions and with the policies of 
the  controller  or  processor  in  relation  to  the  protection  of  personal  data,  including  the  assignment  of 
responsibilities, the raising of awareness and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related 
audits; 

  (c) to ensure that data subjects are informed of their rights and obligations pursuant to this Regulation; 
  (d)  to  provide  advice  where  requested  as  regards  the  necessity  for  a  notification  or  a  communication  of  a 

personal data breach pursuant to Articles 34 and 35; 

  (e)  to  provide  advice  where  requested  as  regards  the  data  protection  impact  assessment  and  monitor  its 
performance pursuant to Article 39 and to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor in case of doubt as 
to the need for a data protection impact assessment; 

  (f) to provide advice where requested as regards the need for prior consultation of the European Data Protection 
Supervisor pursuant to Article 40; to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor in case of doubt as to the 
need for a prior consultation; 

  (g)  to  respond  to  requests  from  the  European  Data  Protection  Supervisor;  within  the  sphere  of  his  or  her 
competence, to cooperate and consult with the European Data Protection Supervisor at the latter’s request or 
on his or her own initiative; 

  (h) to ensure that the rights and freedoms of data subjects are not adversely affected by processing operations.

only available to DPOs).

facilitate this action, the EDPS has recently appointed a dedicated contact person who will coordinate 
such requests and act as the entry point between the DPO network and the EDPS.  
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
Yes, the Position Paper on the role of Data Protection Officers of the EU institutions and bodies was 
published on 30 September 2018 (replacing the Position Paper of 2005)27. This paper covers the 
following aspects: designation, position, and tasks of the DPO, and relations between the DPO and 
the EDPS.  
 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
EDPS actions include: fact-finding exercises (i.e. regular surveys sent to EUIs including questions on the 
DPO role, consultation of the DPOs on the draft DPO Position Paper), informal contacts, investigations 
in the context of complaints and consultations.  

Outcome of these actions include: survey reports, letters, decisions, recommendations and general 
guidance.  

No corrective measures in this context have been taken so far. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The EDPS will use the results to feed into our ongoing discussion with the network of EUI DPOs on 
actions needed to further strengthen the role of DPOs and ensure their independence. A discussion on 
the survey results already took place at the EDPS-DPOs meeting of 30 November 2023. The DPOs 
discussed  the  results  in  workshops  divided  into  three  main  areas:  1)  designation  and  resources 
(including externalisation of tasks); 2) tasks; and 3) role and position (including conflicts of interest). 
The request from DPOs to receive more guidance from the EDPS, including the envisaged update of 
the  DPO  Position  Paper,  was  also  part  of  this  discussion.  The  updated  version  will  draw  on  the 
experience gained throughout the year to give more hands-on guidance, with practical examples, for 
both EUIs and DPOs.

Overall, the outcome of the survey does not seem to warrant any corrective measures or investigative 
actions  by  the  EDPS.  Nevertheless,  the  EDPS  may  look  into  whether  the  reported  cases  of 
dismissal/penalisation require further action at this stage.  
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The level of awareness and compliance of the EUIs is high. Most DPOs seem to have a real impact in 
their EUI as they report that their advice is generally followed. The level of experience and expertise 
of  EUI  DPOs  is  high,  a  clear  indication  that  the  DPO  function  is  becoming  more  and  more 
professionalised. Most DPOs also benefit from regular training, which contributes to a high level of 
professionalism. Furthermore, a very large majority report that there is a written description of their 
tasks and that they are involved in almost all the data protection related tasks listed in the survey. 
Many DPOs are asked to take on additional tasks, such as developing the organisation’s data protection 
processes, dealing with data subjects’ requests to exercise their rights, or drafting/negotiating data 
processing agreements.  

As many as 19 DPOs are full time DPOs, which implies that not only the larger institutions have a full 
time DPO, but also certain smaller EUIs. Involvement of DPOs is also very satisfactory, with a large 
majority reporting that they are consulted in 75-100% of all data protection related issues and their 
opinions are followed in most cases. The majority of EUIs also documents the reasons for not following 
the DPO’s advice where applicable. Independence of DPOs seems to be respected in almost all EUIs, 
with only a few reporting that they receive instructions. The large majority replied that they had access 
to sufficient information all the time or most of the time. 

 

 

Further guidance from the EDPS is requested by almost all the DPOs - Q&As/FAQs, training material 
and  documentation,  both  for  themselves  and  for  internal  distribution  within  their  EUI,  as  well  as 
guidelines and online tools, could be means to satisfy this demand. The recent designation of an EDPS 
contact point for the DPO network will also be an asset in this respect: it will not only foster efficiency 
and cohesion among the existing collaborative frameworks (DPO Support Group, Roundtable for DPOs, 
regular bilateral meetings with the DPOs of the largest EUIs, etc.), but also develop other mutually 
beneficial initiatives, such as training (including a possible DPO certification). 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 
 
As expected, the main issue for (in particular part time) DPOs seems to be a lack of resources. This 
translates both as a lack of time to perform their DPO duties and as lack of additional staff resources. 
As indicated earlier, almost half of the DPOs estimate that their resources are insufficient to fulfil their 
tasks. Only half of DPOs have a deputy and less than 30% have their own budget. It is potentially a 
cause for concern that 18 DPOs did not reply to the question how much working time they can allocate 
to DPO tasks and duties. If this result is caused by a reluctance to reply, this could be an indication that 
the DPOs fear that their honesty could have a negative impact for them. Even if retaliation in form of 
dismissal or penalisation remain rare cases, it is still a cause for concern that three DPOs report having 
been victim of such measures. 

3.  Are there any leading practices of the organisations you have contacted that you would like to 

 

share?

In accordance with Article 45(3) EUDPR, all EUIs have to adopt further implementing rules concerning 
the DPO. The implementing rules should in particular concern the tasks, duties and powers of the DPO. 
Although this is a legal requirement for all EUIs and thus not merely a practice, the EDPS believes that 
it may be useful also for organisations under the GDPR to adopt a written policy for defining the role 
and tasks of their DPO. This is also reflected in the replies where almost all of the respondents indicated 
that the organisation’s management has clearly defined and given a written description of the DPOs 
tasks.  

Similarly,  most  of  the  DPOs  indicate  that  the  written  description  of  the  DPO’s  tasks  have  been 
communicated to the personnel of the EUI.  

Finally, many of the EUI DPOs issue annual activity reports that detail their work and contribute to 
enhancing transparency and raising awareness.

Estonian Supervisory Authority – Data Protection Inspectorate  

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) The role and position of the data protection officer.  
In most cases, the data protection officer is not subordinated to the highest level of management, in 
some cases the data protection officer is, for example, an office worker performing other tasks. Half 
of the respondents also stated that they do not report regularly to the management level, nor are they 
required to do so.  
The controller or processor shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate, compliance with data 
protection requirements. Where the data controller takes decisions that do not comply with the GDPR 
and the data protection officer’s advice, the data protection officer must be given the opportunity to 
make his or her dissenting opinion clearly known to the highest level of management and decision-
makers.  In  this  regard,  Article  38(3)  states  that  the  data  protection  officer  ‘shall  be  directly 
subordinated  to  the  highest  level  of  management  of  the  controller  or  processor’.  Such  direct 
subordination shall ensure that the senior management is aware of the advice and recommendations 
of the data protection officer that are part of the data protection officer’s tasks of informing and 
advising the controller or processor. In situations where a person performing the duties of a data 
protection officer is located in an entirely different department and is directly subordinate to, for 
example, the head of the department, it is doubtful whether he or she will always be able to convey 
his/her messages to the management board. If, for example, a data protection officer tasks has been 
assigned  to  some  office  worker,  it  is  also  doubtful  that  he/she  would  be  regularly  involved,  for 
example, in highest management meetings and that his or her presence will be ensured when decisions 
with data protection implications are taken.  
Among other things, this kind of work management and organisational structure raises doubts as to 
how the autonomy of the data protection officer is guaranteed and that the data protection officer 
does  not  receive  instructions  for the  performance of  his/her  duties.  If  a  data  protection officer  is 
several steps below the highest level of management in the organisation’s structure, it is doubtful that 
he/she will not receive instructions in his/her activities and will be able to perform his/her duties with 
sufficient autonomy. Of course, only the fact that a data protection officer is located in the middle or 
lower  level of  the  structure may  not  immediately  indicate  that  the  data  protection  officer  has  no 
autonomy. However, the fact that half of respondents do not report to management suggests that an 
officer is actually reporting to someone else or not at all. 
Possible solutions to the issue starts with raising awareness. Organisations need to understand what a 
data  protection  officer  is  doing  and  his/her  role  and  responsibilities  within  the  organisation.  By 
understanding this, organisations will also better understand why a data protection officer’s autonomy 
is crucial and why a data protection officer needs to be subordinated to a higher level of management. 
2) The role and position of the data protection officer.  
In organisations, other employees still do not understand exactly what data protection is, everything 
with the word ‘data’ in it is believed to be within the competence of the data protection officer. 
The answers of some respondents showed that sometimes there is not enough knowledge about what 
is exactly is data protection and which questions are dealt with by a data protection officer. One of the 

33 

 

respondents specifically pointed out that in an organisation the role of a data protection officer is 
understood  differently  and  also  incorrectly.  Data  protection  officer  explained  that  he/she  also 
performs tasks in the field of IT and information security, legal and compliance, and in other expert 
role and receives on his/her desk all tasks which, even briefly, contains the word ‘data’. However, not 
everything related to data does not belong to the field of personal data protection, and therefore the 
data protection officer is expected to carry out tasks that are not actually part of his/her duties.  
Such  problems  may  concern  Article  38(2)  of  the  GDPR,  which  provides  that  the  controller  and 
processor shall support the data protection officer in the performance of his/her tasks by providing 
him or her with the necessary resources to carry out those tasks. Giving the data protection officer 
sufficient time to perform his/her duties can also be understood as a necessary resource. Otherwise, 
the inconsistency of priorities may result in the data protection officer’s critical tasks being neglected. 
Giving the data protection officer sufficient time to delve into his/her duties is essential. In a situation 
where a data protection officer is overburdened with tasks that do not actually fall within his/her 
competence, it is possible to create a situation in which he/she is unable to carry out his/her duties. 
This, in turn, increases the risk of infringements and is detrimental to the organisation as a whole. Not 
to mention, it also contributes burnout.  
In most cases, data protection officers also have many other tasks and data protection officers must 
be  involved  in  the  various  processes  of  the  organisation,  but  in  practice,  the  employees  of  the 
organisation face difficulties in distinguishing between areas related to the protection of personal data 
and other areas related to data processing. Which may lead to the fact that the data protection officer 
is not involved in the necessary processes. 
The awareness of data protection in organisations varies. There are also data protection officers in 
organisations who perceive that there has been an increase in employees and management awareness 
of data protection officers work what they do. The nature and necessity of data protection appears to 
be clearer in the public sector. However, this is not a rule of thumb either, because in the monitoring 
we also discovered organisations that did not have a data protection officer at all, even though the 
designation was mandatory for them. 
It is probably still necessary, as a supervisory authority, to inform about what falls within the scope of 
the GDPR and what is personal data and so. But also about the duties and competences of the data 
protection officer. 
3) The role and position of the data protection officer / the tasks and resources of the data protection 
officer.  
Around 30 % of respondents stated that the tasks of the data protection officer have not been clearly 
and in written form defined by management and that the description of the tasks of the DPO has not 
been communicated or made known in any other way to other employees.  
This may indirectly conflict with Article 38(2) of the GDPR, according to which the organisation must 
support the data protection officer by providing him or her with the means necessary to perform 
his/her  duties  and  maintain  the  level  of  expertise  and  access  to  personal  data  and  personal  data 
processing operations. It is important that the appointment of a data protection officer is officially 
notified  to  all  staff  members  and  that  his/her  presence  and  duties  are  known  throughout  the 
organisation. The information provided to staff could clearly indicate the exact tasks and scope of the 
data protection officer’s tasks. The formal notification of the appointment of a data protection officer 
to all staff members ensures that his/her presence and duties are known throughout the organisation. 
A lack of knowledge and understanding within the organisation of what a data protection officer is 
doing, what his/her tasks and the fact that a data protection officer has been appointed at all makes it 
difficult for the DPO to carry out his/her work and perform the assigned tasks.  
As a positive fact, it can be pointed out that in most cases, the tasks of data protection officers are still 
defined in the employment contract. A more problematic issue in general is how the information about 
the tasks and their scope is communicated to, for example, other employees and management. Several 
working parties have also recommended that the data controllers should clearly indicate the precise 

34 

 

tasks and scope of the data protection officers’ tasks, both in the data protection officers’ contract, 
but  also  in  the  information  provided  to  staff  and management  (and,  where  appropriate,  to other 
stakeholders).  
To the extent that data protection officers perform tasks other than data protection, it is particularly 
important that tasks are defined in writing. Otherwise, the inconsistency of priorities may result in the 
data protection officer’s tasks being neglected. In addition, this increases the risk of a data protection 
officer not being involved in the necessary processes early enough. 
It is also worth determining how much time is needed to perform the tasks of the data protection 
officer and what is the priority level of the data protection officer's tasks. According to that, a work 
plan should be also drawn up.  
In particular, this problem could be solved by more communication at the level of society and the state. 
The role of the data protection officer still needs to be clarified. In most cases, however, it all starts 
from the management and how the need for a data protection officer in the management is perceived. 
The problem could also be solved by improving intra-organisational communication. 
4) The designation, knowledge and experience of the data protection officer.  
Only  half  of  respondents  replied  that  expert  knowledge  of  data  protection  regulation  and  expert 
knowledge  of  data  protection  practices  were  also  critical  when  hiring  a  data  protection  officer. 
However, almost all respondents said that ability to fulfil the tasks in accordance with the GDPR was 
required to appoint a data protection officer. 12 % of respondents said that no particular expertise on 
data protection was required, but the appointment of data protection officer was compulsory. 
However, this may also be related to the fact that half of the respondents’ data protection officers had 
3-5 years of experience in the organisation’s field of activity and 70 % of respondents had 3-5 years or 
more in the field of data protection. This means that they were hired when the General Data Protection 
Regulation came into force or some time after that. It was probably more difficult to find competent 
people back then, and the threshold was set lower. The necessary level of professional knowledge is 
not directly determined by the General Data protection Regulation and it should be determined in 
accordance with the data processing operations. The level of knowledge must be commensurate with 
the sensitivity, complexity and amount of the data processed by the organisation. Otherwise, the data 
protection officer may not be appointed under the conditions set out in Article 37(5) GDPR. As said, 
where the processing of data is particularly complex or involves a large amount of sensitive personal 
data,  the  DPO  may  need  more  expertise.  Nearly  half  of  the  respondents  had  worked  in  the 
organisation’s field of activity for 3-5 years. 18 % of respondents had worked for 1-2 years and the 
same number (18 %) for over 8 years. This kind of long-term work experience is positive, as knowledge 
of the business sector and organisation is always beneficial. The data protection officer should also be 
well aware of the data processing activities, information systems, data security and data protection 
needs of the controller. In general, mostly the tasks of the data protection officers are assigned to 
some existing staff members, which is positive in the sense that they have experience, but a lack of 
data protection knowledge may make it more difficult for the data protection officers to work, as this 
is a rather complex and specific area. 
The number of top specialists working in the field of data protection in Estonia may still be limited due 
to  the  lack  of  training  for  high-level  data  protection  officers.  In  addition,  such  training  is  mostly 
expensive and would mostly require financial support from the employer. This, on the other hand, puts 
employers  in  a  situation where  they may  not  have  enough  choice  in  the  labour market.  The  best 
solution is to hire an existing employee. This is a bigger and more complex problem, but as one possible 
solution would also be to provide a high level of data protection education at national level. 
5) The tasks and resources of the data protection officer.  
While working on a full-time basis, less than half can fully focus on the tasks of the data protection 
officer, and 40 % of the data protection officers who replied to the questionnaire considered that the 

 

35 

resources allocated (number of subordinates, number of working hours) are not sufficient to perform 
the tasks assigned to the data protection officer.  
Article 38(2) GDPR provides that an organisation must support the data protection officer by providing 
him/her  with  the  necessary  resources  to  carry  out  his/her  tasks.  Depending  on  the  processing 
operations and the activities and size of the organisation, the necessary means can be understood, 
inter alia, as sufficient time to perform the tasks of the data protection officer, as well as adequate 
financial support hiring personnel. On the one hand, it is not surprising that we received such answers 
and results because the workload of data protection officers is enormous.  
Only about half of the data protection officers working in the public sector feel that the resources 
allocated are sufficient to carry out their tasks. In the private sector, therefore, data protection officers 
feel somewhat greater support from the management of the organisations. Public sector institutions 
are mostly large, with a wide variety of sectors of activity and a higher number of data subjects, as 
services are mostly aimed at all country citizens.  
In order for data protection officers to be fully committed to their work tasks and to be able to perform 
them at sufficient level, larger organisations should hire another data protection officer in addition to 
already working data protection officer. As a positive example, one of the monitored organisations, 
which is a large public sector institution and therefore also a very large data controller, already has 
two data protection officers working. One ministry also pointed out that they are hiring an additional 
person to help the data protection officer. As a side note, it should be kept in mind that Estonia is a 
small country and the number of public employees is always kept low here, so this is a positive example 
where, despite this trend, the need for a data protection officers has been understood.  
As one idea and option, there could be some kind of questionnaire or indicator, by answering which, 
based on the result, it would be possible to assess how likely the organisation needs more than one 
data protection officer. The Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate has made similar control questions 
to data controllers, for example regarding privacy policies, and on the basis of this, data controller can 
check whether their privacy policy covers everything necessary. It may be that in those organisations 
where the data protection officers themselves feel that it is necessary to hire more personnel, but the 
management  has  not  done  it,  the  management  does  not  understand  the  workload  of  the  data 
protection officer, and the data protection officer alone obviously cannot convince them of this either. 
Such questionnaire would allow the managements of the organisations to get a so-called external 
opinion, which may seem more impartial to them.

We  do  not  have  specific  statistics  on  such  actions.  But  we  have  had  an  investigation  where  we 
inspected whether the data protection officer had been granted independence in the performance of 
his/her duties and whether the data protection officer was released from the workplace in violation of 
the GDPR (for performing his/her tasks and duties). We terminated the investigation with a warning.

possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
Specific  actions  are  not  planned  yet.  We  plan  actions  in  more  detailed  after  the  results  of  the

Part II – Substantive issues 
 
The  Hellenic  Supervisory  Authority  at  this  point  can  identify  mainly  issues  relating  to  the  above 
highlighted categories28 and more precisely issues that arise from a prima facie analysis of the replies 
to questions is 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32, 33 and 37 of the questionnaire. In other words, the 
emerging issues stem from the application of Articles 37 – 39 GDPR and corresponding Articles 6-8 of 
national Law 4624/2019 on measures for implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data, and transposition of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 27 April 2016, on data protection. Since the Hellenic Supervisory Authority is 
participating in this coordinated action by conducting also a formal investigation in 31 public bodies, 
an in depth analysis as well as the required follow up with letters and requests for documentation in 
order to substantiate the replies provided to the questionnaire are necessary both for the formal 
investigation and for providing answers to this Part II – substantive issues. The process of the formal 
investigation is still on early stage and therefore we are currently unable to relay more information.

possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
As  mentioned  above,  the  Hellenic  Supervisory  Authority  is  conducting  a  formal  investigation  and 
consequently it is not possible to give an overall indication of the actions to be taken as a result of the 
outcome of the investigation. Still, it is high likely that measures such as recommendations and possible 
corrective ones will be issued.  
 
However, we can inform you at this stage that in three cases out of the 31 questionnaires that the 
Hellenic Supervisory Authority sent out to public bodies, where the Hellenic Supervisory Authority did 
not receive replies, the Hellenic Supervisory Authority’s Board will convene in order to issue a decision 
where the application of corrective measures for the infringement of Article 31 GDPR (cooperation 
with the supervisory authority), according to Article 58 (2) GDPR will be considered. In two out of the 
these  three  cases  there  is  no  appointment  of  DPO  and  therefore  this  infringement  will  also  be 
considered by the Hellenic Supervisory Authority’s Board resulting in these cases too in the application 
of correctional measures or even an administrative fine. Please note that this also relates to the replies 
provided in question 4, in the sense that it explains why there was no organisation replying that they 
had not designated a DPO, as two public bodies that had not appointed DPO did not reply to the 
questionnaire at all.  
 
Furthermore, due to the high number of public bodies that are formally being investigated, it is not 
possible to provide you at this point with a time frame of the conclusion of the investigation.

Even though it is – as mentioned above - still early stages of the ongoing formal investigation, the

ES SA 

Spanish Supervisory Authority – Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD)  
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) The designation, knowledge and experience of the DPO 
 
According to the answers provided, 86% of respondents were not staff members, which confirm the 
figures ES SA have following the communication procedure of DPO contact information. In our view 
this figure could be a confirmation that a significant number of organisations contract external DPOs, 
which in some cases could show a weakness since some designated DPO could be in charge of several 
entities sharing resources among them and increasing the risk that the role of DPO can be consider as 
a  formality  to  be  accomplished  instead  a  real  and  proactive  involvement  of  the  DPO  in  the  data 
processing carried out by the organisations. 
 
Regarding  the  duration  of  DPOs  appointments,  the  pool  shows  that  58%  of  respondents  have  a 
permanent  relationship  with  the  controller  which  shows  an  important  number  of  temporary 
appointments which could correlate with the numbers of external DPO. This issue about temporary 
appointments can correlate with the fact explaining in the previous paragraph and may reinforce one 
of  our  greatest  concerns  in  this  field  in  relation  to  the  risk  that  controllers  prioritize  a  formal 
designation of the DPO in order to cover the legal requirement instead a true proactive commitment 
on their part.  
 
The rest of the responses to the questions raised in this section show answers that can be qualified as 
‘expected’. 
 
2) The tasks and resources of the DPO 
 
At first glance, most of the responses shown in this section show a fairly positive situation of the DPOs 
in terms of availability of resources that may also have its not so positive aspects. 
 
3) The role and position of the DPO 
 
The responses given in this section show, perhaps, a more realistic panorama with some aspects to be 
improved such as the participation of the DPO in all issues in which the processing of personal data is 
involved. 
 
4) Guidance of the Supervisory Authority 
 
As stated in our comment to question 41, just a few answers have been provided indicating that in 
general terms respondents considered appropriate the guidance, Q&A/FAQs, online tools, guidelines 
as well as the publication of the opinions and decisions provided in the web page of the ES SA.

Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
No actions have been taken prior to launching the coordinated action. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
For the moment no actions have been planned based on the results of this coordinated action beyond 
those that are already planned, such as holding sectoral meetings with the DPOs of those most relevant 
sectors from the point of view of the processing of personal data and that the Spanish SA carries out 
on a regular basis: education, health, assurance and financial, telecommunications, etc. 
 
In addition, Spanish SA will continue to develop guidelines and tools in several data protection fields 
in order to assist controllers, processors and DPOs to fulfil their obligations under GDPR. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The Spanish SA will continue to develop the tools, meetings, and consultation channels it has been 
promoting since the entry into force of the GDPR to support DPOs so that they can develop their work 
with the appropriate resources and means in order to ensure their independence. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
In general terms, we consider the results shown in the survey very positively and we trust that it has 
also served to make controllers, processors and also DPOs aware of the importance and scope of the 
obligations under GDPR. At the same time, the Spanish SA considers that it is necessary to continue 
insisting  that  data  controllers  become  aware  of  the  importance  of  the  DPO's  role  in  ensuring 
compliance with data protection regulations as well as the necessity to provide resources, in terms of 
training and budget, in the fulfilment of their tasks.  
 
To this end, the Spanish SA will continue to develop guidelines and tools to assist those controllers and 
DPOs in order to comply with the GDPR. 
 

 

42 

In addition, the Spanish SA will continue to respond to queries directly raised by DPOs in the query 
channel established for this purpose.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) The tasks and resources of the data protection officer  
In many cases the organisation’s management hasn’t made a clearly defined and written description 
of the data protection officer’s tasks. In addition, there seemed to be failures in the organization’’ 
personnel being made aware of the tasks and duties of the data protection officer via the written 
description or otherwise. 

Relates to Articles 39(1) and 38(6) GDPR.  
The tasks and duties of the data protection officer in the organisation should be clearly defined 
in  a  written  document.  This  document  can  be  used  to  clarify  the  cases  in  which  the  data 
protection officer can be consulted. 

 
The data protection officer has often been entrusted with other tasks in addition to those under the 
GDPR. This may lead to potential conflicts of interest. 

Relates to Article 38(6) GDPR.  
The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall 
ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. 
Based  on  the  questionnaire’s  replies,  conclusions  cannot  be  drawn  directly  from  the 
assignment  of other  tasks  to  the  data  protection officer,  but  the  examination  of  potential 
conflicts of interest must be carried out on a case-by-case basis. 
 

Based on the questionnaire, the resources allocated to fulfil the tasks of the data protection officer 
are often deemed insufficient. A deputy is also not always designated for the data protection officer. 

Relates to Article 38(2) GDPR.  
Insufficient  resources  allocated  to  the  tasks  of  the  data  protection  officer  and  absence  of 
deputy can contribute to weakening e.g. the timely exercise of data subjects’ rights.

2. The role and position of the data protection officer 

Based on the questionnaire, the organisations have challenges and deficiencies in making sure the 
data protection officer is involved and/or consulted when the organisation is handling and solving 
issues relating to the processing and protection of personal data.  

• 
• 

• 

Relates to Article 38(1) GDPR.  
The  controller  and  the  processor  shall  ensure  that  the  data  protection  officer  is  involved, 
properly and in a timely manner, in all issues that relate to the protection of personal data. 
In the questionnaire, there is a variation between the data protection officers’ views on how 
they are involved and/or consulted on the aforementioned issues. Some of the data protection 

44 

 

• 

officers feel that the consulting is done very well, while others feel they are not consulted in a 
sufficient way. 
If the data protection officer is not consulted and/or involved in the handling and solving issues 
relating to the processing and protection of personal data, the decisions being made might not 
take into account all the requirements set out in the GDPR or other data protection legislation.  

 
Based on the questionnaire, all data protection officers are not required to report regularly to the 
highest management level of the organisation, nor does it always report on a voluntary basis. 

• 
• 

Relates to Article 38(3) GDPR. 
If  regular  reporting  is  not  done  to  the  highest  management  level  of  the  organisation,  the 
management is unlikely to receive sufficient information on the work carried out by the data 
protection officer within the organisation or on data protection issues in general. 

 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
The FI SA publishes general guidance for data protection officers on its website 
(https://tietosuoja.fi/tietosuojavastaavat):  

• 
Tasks of the data protection officer -section 
•  Designating a data protection officer -section

Internet links for more information outside the FI SA website. 

 

In addition, the FI SA publishes an electronic newsletter (https://tietosuoja.fi/uutiskirje) about six 
times a year, aimed at data protection officers.  
 
In addition to the written material the FI SA provides telephone guidance for data protection officers 
(https://tietosuoja.fi/puhelinneuvonta): Telephone guidance service provides general guidance and 
support in matters involving data protection and lets you know if the case requires more detailed 
investigation and processing at the FI SA Office. 
 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Discussions with organisations and data protection officers providing general advice. 
 

 

45 

The FI SA participates and lectures in seminars and training sessions in which data protection officers 
also participate. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The FI SA has not yet decided what actions will be taken in this matter. The option of taking actions 
related to the Coordinated Enforcement Action is still open.  
 
The FI SA does recognise the importance of sufficient knowledge of the data protection officer’s role 
and tasks in the designating organisation and the compliancy to the legislation concerning data 
protection officer. 
 
It should be noted that an administrative fine cannot be issued to public authorities in Finland at the 
moment. However, the Programme of the Finnish Government (2023) states that provisions on 
administrative fines for breaches of information security will be laid down in such a manner that they 
will apply equally to both the public and private sector.  
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The organisations of the data protection officers who responded to the questionnaire represent 
different sectors. Organisations differ from one another and e.g. the number of their employees 
varies considerably. 
 
The resources for data protection work in organisations vary. This may contribute to a variation 
between organisations and sectors in the level of data protection work on the designation, tasks and 
role of data protection officers as well as in the overall information on data protection. 
 
Generally, shortcomings in data protection work carried out by data protection officers can often be 
identified. Based on the questionnaire, only in few replies was the level of data protection work with 
regard to data protection officers considered to be completely unproblematic.

French Supervisory Authority – Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
Issue 1: Sufficient time to fulfil DPO’s duties  

1.  One issue identified in our investigations is the fact that several DPOs do not have sufficient 

time to fulfill their duties. 

3. 

2.  This issue concerns Article 38(2) of the GDPR, that requires the organization to support its DPO 

by ‘providing resources necessary to carry out [their] tasks’.  
In certain cases, it would have been appropriate for the DPO to be supported with a team, but 
the organizations decided not to hire data protection specialists other than the DPO.  

4.  This issue can take very different forms in the different organizations: for instance, a DPO can 
work full-time, receive the assistance of a team, and still lack the necessary time resources to 
manage their missions. However, we noted that this issue was more frequent when the DPO 
was shared between organizations. 
5.  Possible solutions to this issue are:  
•  For data protection authorities: To remind data controllers of their obligations under the GDPR 

(in particular Article 38 of the GDPR).  

•  For data protection authorities: To publish an ‘engagement letter’ template. Such document 
could be given by organizations to the DPO when they take up their post. This document 
should  stipulate  in  particular  that  the  organization  must  support  its  DPO  by  providing 
resources necessary to carry out their tasks, and specify what these resources are. The CNIL 
already

DPO). 

document; 

document

available 

such 

this 

is 

•  For organizations/DPOs: To formalize the DPO duties and conditions for performing the DPO’s 

duties in an ‘engagement letter’. 

•  For  organizations/DPOs:  establishment  of  an 

internal  network  of 

‘data  protection 

intermediaries’ that can report data protection issues to DPO.  

•  For organizations/DPOs: To draft a work plan, presented by the DPO to the data controller in 
order to agree on the DPO’s objectives and DPO’s resources, and to prioritize the DPO’s tasks.  

Issue 2 : DPO’s qualifications and training  

1.  An issue identified in our investigations is the fact that some organizations do not seem to 
have designated their DPO on the basis of professional qualities, in particular knowledge of 
data protection law. 

 

47 

In addition, it was noted the insufficiency, or the absence of training for some DPOs, despite 
the  fact  that  DPOs  must  be  given  the  opportunity  to  stay  up  to  date  with  regards  to 
developments within the field of data protection.  

2.  These issues concern Articles 37(5) and 38(2) of the GDPR.  

Article 37(5) of the GDPR provides that ‘the data protection officer shall be designated on the 
basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and 
practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39’. 
In addition, Article 38(2) of the GDPR provides that ‘the controller and processor shall support 
the  data  protection  officer  in  performing  the  tasks  referred  to  in  Article  39  by  providing 
resources  necessary  to  carry  out  those  tasks  and  access  to  personal  data  and  processing 
operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge’.  

3.  We found that companies sometimes had to choose between experts in data protection and 
experts in the particular field they are working in. Finding people who have expert knowledge 
in, for instance, aviation laws and data protection laws can still prove difficult for organizations. 
4.  We noted that DPOs come from varied background (technical, law, archivist, etc.) which is 

beneficial for the profession. 

5.  Possible solutions to this issue are:  
•  For  organizations/DPOs:  in  France,  organizations  can  designate  DPO  holding  a  DPO 
certification (even if it is not compulsory to be certified in order to be designated DPO). Since 
2018, in order to support organizations in identifying the appropriate profile, the CNIL has 
approved  organizations  that  issue  a  DPO  skills  certification29  on  the  basis  of  its  reference 
system, and keeps a list of such organizations. 

•  For data protection authorities: To publish an ‘engagement letter’ template: this document 
should stipulate in particular that the DPO ‘must benefit from regular training allowing them 
to maintain their specialized knowledge in the field of data protection’. As stated above, the 
CNIL already published such document.  

•  For  data  protection  authorities:  To  publish  and  translate  tools  for  training  (the  CNIL  has 
published numerous content, such as workshops or webinars, and online training (MOOC)). 
We  noted  that  trainings  provided  (for  free)  by  data  protection  authorities  were  very  well 
received by DPOs. 

•  For data protection authorities: To work in connection with universities and business schools 

on an inventory of DPO training courses.  

•  For organizations/DPOs: To formalize the DPO duties and conditions for performing the DPO’s 

duties in an ‘engagement letter’. 

•  For organizations/DPOs: To draft a ‘training plan’.  
•  For  organizations/DPO: to  provide  a multi-fields  team  of  people working  with  the  DPO  to 

support its activities and knowledge.  

Issue 3 : Involvement of the DPO in all issues relating to the protection of personal data and access to 
other services of the organization  

1.  Another issue identified in our investigations is that some DPOs are not involved in issues 
relating to data protection, and do not have access to other services (such as HR, IT…) and 
consequently do not receive information and support from those services. 

2.  Article 38(1) of the GDPR provides that the controller and the processor shall ensure that the 
DPO is ‘involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection 
of personal data’. Article 38(2) of the GDPR provides that ‘the controller and processor shall

support  the  data  protection  officer  in  performing  the  tasks  referred  to  in  Article  39  by 
providing  resources  necessary  to  carry  out  those  tasks  and  access  to  personal  data  and 
processing operations’.  

3.  This issue entails that the DPO does not have sufficient information on some data processing 
operations put in place in their organization. It can also signify that the DPO will not be involved 
at the earliest stage of the decisions on data processing, for instance when he or she is not 
involved in strategic meeting. This is detrimental as it is easier (and, in fact, mandatory to 
comply with data protection by design requirement) to implement data protection principles 
from the start of a project.  

4.  We  found  that  organizations  differ  on  this  matter  in  the  way  that  they  have  or  have  not 
formalized how and when the DPO should be involved: in some instances, the process is very 
detailed and communicated to all employees, in other cases it is only an informal practice. 

5.  Possible solutions to this issue are:  
•  For data protection authorities: To publish an ‘engagement letter’ template: this document 
should stipulate that the DPO has access to processing operations and personal data within his 
organization. As stated above, the CNIL published such a document.  

•  For organizations/DPOs: To formalize the DPO duties and conditions for performing the DPO’s 

duties in an ‘engagement letter’. 

•  For  organizations/DPOs:  To 

internal  procedures  within  the  organization’s 
governance, in order to ensure that the DPO is involved from the earliest stage possible in all 
issues  relating  to  data  protection  (for  instance,  exercise  of  rights,  data  breaches…),  and 
communicate such procedures within the organization.  

implement 

Issue 4: Data protection audit and access to personal data and processing operations 

1.  Another issue identified in our investigations is that DPOs can have difficulties in carrying out 
data  protection  audits,  in  particular  when  he  or  she  does  not  have  access  to  processing 
operations and personal data within his organization. 

2.  This issue concerns in particular article 38(2) and article 39(1)b) of the GDPR.  

Article 38(2) of the GDPR requires the organization to support its DPO by ‘providing resources 
necessary to carry out [their] tasks and access to personal data and processing operations’.  
Article 39(1)b) of the GDPR provides that ‘the data protection officer shall have at least the 
following  tasks:  […]  (b)  to  monitor  compliance  with  this  Regulation,  with  other  Union  or 
Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor 
in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, 
awareness-raising  and  training  of  staff  involved  in  processing  operations,  and  the  related 
audits’.  

3.  We noticed that organizations very rarely formalize how their DPO can audit already existing 
data processing. The emphasis is commonly put on involving the DPO in the conception of new 
processing but the review of existing process lacks proper documentation, in particular with 
respects to the way DPOs can access or require access to databases.  

4.  N/A, this was observed across organizations. 
5.  Possible solutions to this issue are:  
•  For data protection authorities: To publish an ‘engagement letter’ template (see above). 
•  For organizations/DPOs: To formalize the DPO duties and conditions for performing the DPO’s 

duties in an ‘engagement letter’.  

•  For  organizations/DPOs:  To  draft  an  internal  document  formalizing  the  cases  and  the 
conditions under which the DPO’s access will be carried out (e.g., audit, data breaches, etc.).  

 

49 

 
Issue 5: Safeguards enabling DPOs to perform their tasks in an independent manner  

1.  Another issue identified during our investigations is that some organizations did not properly 

ensure the independence of their DPO.  

2.  Article 38(3) provides that controllers/processors are required to ensure that the DPO ‘does 
not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of [his or her] tasks. He or she shall not be 
dismissed or penalized by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data 
protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the 
processor’.  

3.  We did not find any cases where the DPO has been penalized or dismissed by the controller or 
the processor for performing their tasks. However, we found that no safeguards had been put 
in place to prevent such a decision to occur. While this is not in itself a breach of GDPR, it is 
problematic that no protections against unlawful dismissal are put in place, as this subject 
should be tackled before the problem arises. 

4.  This has been observed in a majority of organization. However, the subject was addressed in 

some engagement letters or deontological charters.  

5.  Possible solutions to this issue are:  
•  For data protection authorities: To remind data controllers of their obligations under the GDPR 
(including Article 38 of the GDPR and the independence of the DPO), in particular when a new 
DPO is designated.  

•  For data protection authorities: To publish an ‘engagement letter’ template (see above).  
•  For organizations/DPOs: To formalize the DPO duties and conditions for performing the DPO’s 

duties in an ‘engagement letter’.  

•  For  organizations/DPOs:  To  draft  an  annual  report  of  the  DPO’s  activities  provided  to  the 
highest management level; and to present once per year this report to the highest level of the 
organization.  

•  For  DPOs:  in  the  event  of  independence  issues,  the  DPO  may  collect  information  on  this 

independence issue.  

 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
First of all, the CNIL’s website contains a ‘hub’ regarding DPOs topics30. This hub contains information 
concerning the designation31, the role32 or the certification of the DPO33. Moreover, some contents 
concern DPOs in specific sectors (for instance, the designation of a DPO in territorial authorities34).  
 
It should be noted that in 2019,  the French Ministry of Labour decided to work alongside several 
organizations, including the CNIL, in order to launch an online research on the function of DPO. Three

50 

 

editions of this research took place in 2019, 2020 and 2021-2022. The 2021-2022 edition is based on a 
survey of 1811 DPOs designated by the CNIL, interviewed between September and October 202135. 
This research reveals in particular the diversification of profiles of DPOs (47% of DPOs come from fields 
of expertise other than legal and IT) and an important decrease in training (1/3 had not received any 
GDPR training since 2016).  
 
From  now  on, this  annual  study  looks  more  like  an  observatory of the  profession  of DPOs. Many 
researchers join the scientific committee in order to deepen knowledge of the profession of DPOs, and 
interactions with their ecosystem (economic, working relationships…).  
 
In addition, the DPOs can rely on resources available on the CNIL’s website36. DPOs can also attend 
GDPR  presentation  days  (‘Journées  RGPD’)  and  thematic  information  workshops,  including  via 
webinars37.  
 
DPOs can in addition use the online training (MOOC) published by the CNIL for the first time in March 
201938. This training, on the fundamentals of data protection, is open to all and free of charge.  
 
Moreover, it should be noted that since 2018, the CNIL has approved organizations that issue a DPO 
skills certification on the basis of its reference system, and keeps a list of such organizations. Even if it 
is  not  mandatory  to  be  certified  in  order  to  be  designated  DPO,  certification  presents  various 
advantages  (for  its  holder,  certification  constitutes  a  proof  of  their  adequacy  with  the  level  of 
knowledge requirement imposed by the GDPR; for organizations looking for profiles of data protection 
experts, certification represents a guarantee of confidence).  
 
Finally,  on  March  14,  2022,  the  CNIL  published  a  reference  guide  for  questions  about  the  data 
protection officer39. With the help of many professional associations, the CNIL has gathered in this 
guide the most important and useful knowledge about the DPO. 
 
This guide is organized in four parts: 

The role of the DPO; 

- 
-  Appointing a DPO; 
- 
-  CNIL’s support for DPOs. 

Performing the function of DPO; 

 

 

Each  topic  is  illustrated  by  concrete  examples  and  answers  to  frequently  asked  questions  on  the 
subject. From their appointment to the end of their mission, this guide provides essential and precise 
information about the DPO. The CNIL has been particularly careful to provide clear information on how 
to ensure that the DPO can carry out their tasks independently, without any conflict of interest and 
with real efficiency for the organization. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general

guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
No actions had been taken towards the fifteen organisations prior to launching the coordinated action.  
 
However, the CNIL has already taken corrective measures towards other organizations regarding the 
designation and the role of the DPO. For instance, twenty-two cities were ordered to appoint a DPO in 
May 2022. In another case, the CNIL found that an organisation was in violation of Article 38(4) of the 
GDPR because the DPO was not allowed access to the email inbox receiving data subjects' requests.  
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The decisions regarding the outcome of the investigations have yet to be made by the CNIL's President.  
 
The CNIL is currently considering an action plan to improve the conditions under which the DPO is 
appointed and the conditions under which he or she can carry out his or her duties. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The coordinated action cemented our opinion that conducting investigation on the compliance with 
Articles 37, 38 and 39 of the GDPR is more complex than for some other articles. Indeed, targeting the 
right organizations is challenging unless there has been a formal complaint by the (ex-)DPO.  
 
Furthermore, establishing breaches with Articles 38 and 39 requires a thorough analysis (for instance, 
to prove that the resources given to the DPO are insufficient). 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 
 
In order for the profession of DPO to be well identified and understood, it could be interesting to 
launch an annual survey on the DPO role at European level across EU countries. As part of this survey, 
numerous DPOs designated in EU countries could be interviewed. This work could be helped by the 
survey launched in France in 2019 by the French Ministry of Labour (cf. Part III, Question 1 of this 
report),  and  could  be  a  prerequisite  for  a  potential  revision  of  the  Guidelines  on  Data  Protection 
Officers (wp243rev.01), dated October 2017. 
 
In France, a recent study (‘Saving Private DPO’) was published by a former DPO (Bruno Rasle) in May 
2023.  As  part  of  this  study,  26  DPO  were  interviewed.  These  DPOs  were  all  in  serious  difficulty, 
sometimes  isolated  or  dismissed.  The  objective  of  this  work  is  to  identify  the  reasons  of  these 
difficulties and understand if there are similarities, and to make proposals to prevent and manage 
these situations if they occur. The study is available at https://afcdp.net/media/documents/il-faut-
sauver-le-soldat-dpo-bruno-rasle-5-mai-2023.pdf  (an  English  version  of  this  study  is  available  on 
request).

It  could  be  interesting  for  the  EDPB  to  launch  a  study  on  the  DPO  (qualifications,  scope  of  tasks, 
independence, training…) in all EU countries, in order to observe developments and trends. This study 
could be quite similar to the study launched in France (cf. Part III, Question 1). As a reminder, in 2019, 
the French Ministry of Labour decided to work alongside several organisations (including the National 
Agency for Vocational Training (or AFPA) and the CNIL) in order to launch an online research on the 
function of DPO. Three editions of this research took place in 2019, 2020 and 2021-2022. The 2021-
2022  edition  is  based  on  a  survey  of  1811  DPOs  designated  by  the  CNIL,  interviewed  between 
September and October 2021. This research reveals in particular the diversification of profiles of DPOs 
(47% of DPOs come from fields of expertise other than legal and IT) and an important decrease in 
training (1/3 had not received any GDPR training since 2016). 
 
3.  Are there any leading practices of the organisations you have contacted that you would like to 

share? 

• 

 
In our investigations, we observed the following practices that seemed to prove beneficial for the DPO 
and his/her organization:  

‘Engagement letter’: this document formalizes the tasks entrusted to the DPO and is usually 
given by the organization to the DPO when he/she takes up their post. It is important for 
Supervisory  Authority  to  encourage  DPO’s  tasks  to  be  supported  or  highlighted.  The  CNIL 
published  a 
is  available  at 
https://www.cnil.fr/sites/cnil/files/atoms/files/cnil-gdpr practical guide data-protection-
officers.pdf (Appendix 2). This engagement letter can be communicated to the employees of 
the  organizations  to  facilitate  the  involvement  of  the  DPO  in  all  matters  relating  to  data 
protection.

•  Using  the  document  entitled  ‘The  key  questions  to  ask  yourself  when  appointing  a  DPO’, 
published  by  the  CNIL  in  the  reference  guide  on  data  protection  officer  in  March  2022 
(Appendix No.1 of the reference guide)40: this document helps the organization verifying that 
the GDPR requirements for a future DPO are met.  

•  An annual work plan presented by the DPO to the data controller in order to agree on the 

DPO’s objectives and DPO’s resources, and to prioritize DPO’s tasks.  

•  An  annual  report  of  the  DPO’s  activities  provided to  the  highest management  level  and a 

presentation once per year of this report to the highest level of the organization. 

•  Establishment  of  an  internal  network  of  points  of  contact  within  the  organisation,  and 
organisation of regular meetings with the DPO and these contact points: these ‘data protection 
intermediaries’  report  data  protection  issues  to  the  DPO  (such  as  projects,  questions,  or 
request to exercise rights), and provide operational support to the DPO.  
Implementation of internal procedure within the organization’s governance, in order to ensure 
that the DPO is involved from the earliest stage possible in all issues relating to data protection 
(for instance, exercise of rights, data breaches…). This procedure should be communicated 
within the organization.  

• 

•  Becoming a member of an association of Data Protection Officers is a leading practice for DPO, 

in order to prevent isolation and benefit from good practices. 

•  A training plan for the DPO should be scheduled, adapted to the profile of the DPO.

HR SA  

Croatian Supervisory Authority – Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency (AZOP) 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Role of a DPO in the organisation (potential conflict of interest) 
 

1.  113 DPOs when asked about the role in the organisation stated that they are directors/head 
of various departments, like HR department, Marketing department and other roles that could 
cause  the  conflict  of  interest.  A  significant  number  of  DPOs  come  from  the  highest 
management within the organisations, there is a great possibility that such tasks and duties 
could result in a conflict of interests. 
7.46 % (226) of respondents stated that DPO comes from the highest management.  
13.39% (406) of DPOs didn’t give answer to this question. 

2.  Article 38 (6) of the GDPR. 
3.  A significant number of DPOs come from the highest management within the organisations, 
there is a great possibility that such tasks and duties could result in a conflict of interests. 113 
DPOs are performing at the same time roles as i.e. directors, heads of various departments 
where they determine means and purposes of processing of personal data. 

4.  There is a great difference between public authorities and private sector. In most cases, DPOs 

who might be in conflict of interest are coming from public authorities. 

5.  A comprehensive resolution to these issues involves enhancing educational initiatives for Data 
Protection Officers (DPOs) within the public sector. This should be coupled with increased 
involvement  of  the  Data  Protection  Authority  (AZOP)  and,  concurrently,  heightened 
engagement from public authorities. It is imperative to allocate greater focus and resources to 
address data protection-related topics, fostering a collaborative approach to ensure robust 
safeguards and compliance. 

 
2) Knowledge and experience of a DPO 
 

1.  A large number of DPOs do not have enough knowledge and experience in the field of personal 
data to carry out their duties and they don’t invest enough time to gain necessary knowledge 
or to enhance existing one. 
29.03 % (880) of DPOs responded that they have no expert knowledge in the field of personal 
data and that they have nominated DPO because the nomination of a DPO was legal obligation. 
3.63  %  (110)  of  DPOs  doesn’t  know  how  many  years  of  experience  in  the  field  of  data 
protection DPOs has, and 5.05 % (153) of them didn’t give any answer to this question. 
16.66 % (505) of DPOs answered that they invest 0 hours of time on yearly basis to enhance 
or gain knowledge in the field of personal data. 
31.18 % (945) of DPOs answered that they invest 1-8 hours of their time on yearly basis to 
enhance or gain knowledge in the field of personal data. 

 

55 

11.35 % (344) of DPOs said that they don’t know how much time on yearly basis DPO spend to 
enhance or gain knowledge in the field of personal data. 
4.98 % (151) didn’t give any answer to this question 
2.  Article 37 (5) of the GDPR, Article 38 (2) of the GDPR. 

 
3) Time allotted for the DPO to carry out their responsibilities and tasks 
 

1.  A large number of DPOs carry out other tasks, this is just an additional job for them. They don’t 

dedicate enough time to carry out their duties and tasks as a DPO. 
83.47  %  (2530)  of  DPOs  responded  that  being  a  DPO  is  not  their  main  task  (role  in  the 
organisation), it is just and additional task, together with many other tasks. 
7.26 % (220) didn’t respond to the question whether acting as a DPO is their main task (role) 
in the organisation. 
The largest number of respondents 30.55 % (926) of them can dedicate less than 5% of their 
working time for doing their task and duties of a DPO.  
14.02 % (425) of DPOs can dedicate 11 – 20 % of their working time for doing their tasks and 
duties of a DPO. 13.16 % (399) of DPOs didn’t give any answer to this question. 
14.22 % (431) of DPOs is able to dedicate only 1 full working day (8 hours) on monthly basis in 
order to fulfil its duties and tasks as a DPO. 
17.98 % (545) of DPOs is able to dedicate 0 – 0,9 (less than one working day) on monthly basis 
in order to fulfil its duties and tasks as a DPO. 
18.15 % (550) of DPOs is able to dedicate 1,0 – 2,0 working days on monthly basis in order to 
fulfil its duties and tasks as a DPO. 

2.  Article 38 (2) of the GDPR. 
3.  The organisations don’t provide enough time (working hours) to DPO to perform its tasks and 
duties. It could be concluded that they don’t consider data protection as an important topic 
that deserves more time and investments. 

4.  Significant  distinctions  persist  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  regarding  GDPR 
compliance.  The  Act  on  Implementation  of  the  GDPR  stipulates  that  numerous  public 
authorities  are  exempt  from  fines  for  GDPR  infringements.  Consequently,  many  allocate 
minimal time and effort to ensure compliance. Typically, these entities reach out AZOP only 
when a project, such as the development of a new IT solution, is in its final stages. At this 
juncture, they seek assistance in identifying a lawful basis for processing personal data and 
asking for ‘confirmation’ of overall GDPR compliance. 
Within  the  educational  and  health  sectors,  there  exists  a  heightened  awareness  of  GDPR 
compliance.  However,  DPOs  in  these  fields  often  find  themselves  stretched  thin,  lacking 
sufficient time to fulfill their DPO duties adequately. 
In contrast, the private sector demonstrates a more pronounced interest in GDPR compliance. 
This  heightened  concern  is  primarily  fuelled  by  the  fear  of  substantial  fines  and  potential 
damage  to  reputation  resulting  from  GDPR  violations.  Consequently,  DPOs  in  the  private 
sector  tend  to  possess  a  significantly  higher  level of  knowledge,  they  invest  more  time  in 
performing their DPO duties and responsibilities, reflecting the broader commitment to and 
understanding of GDPR requirements. 

5.  Raising  awareness  among  organisations  on  the 

importance  of  the  role  of  DPO. 
Recommendation  sent  to  the  organisations  by  AZOP.  Intensive  campaign  among  top 
management of organisations. More supervisory activities conducted by AZOP in relation to 
Article 38. 

 

56 

 

4) Obligations do not appoint a deputy DPO 
 

1.  83.5 % (2531) of DPOs said that the deputy DPO has not been appointed. 
2.  Article 39 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) of the GDPR. 
3.  Through our daily experiences, it has become evident that this poses a significant challenge 
for organizations. For instance, when the DPO takes sick leave or is absent for any reason, a 
gap is created, leaving no one to fulfill their responsibilities. This scenario presents a dual 
challenge for both the data controller/processor and the Data Protection Authority (AZOP) 
during  supervisory  activities.  Specifically,  organizations  face  issues  providing  explanations 
during audits, citing the unavailability of a replacement for the DPO, resulting in an inability to 
provide requested information promptly. This underscores the critical need for contingency 
plans and designated backups to ensure the continuity of data protection responsibilities and 
compliance even in the absence of DPO. This could be solved by appointing replacement for 
the DPO (deputy DPO). 

4.  No significant differences. 
5.  The organizational solution is to designate a Deputy Data Protection Officer with the requisite 
knowledge and skills to seamlessly assume the responsibilities of the DPO in their absence. 
The appointed deputy should possess a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of a DPO's 
role and functions. 

5) Workload of a DPO and how often he is asked for advice from employees within the organisation 
 

1.  Many DPOs typically handle a modest volume of requests, with the majority receiving up to 10 
inquiries per month from colleagues seeking guidance on data protection matters. A minority 
of  DPOs  consistently  provide  advice  on  data  protection  issues,  demonstrating  a  proactive 
approach. Additionally, a small percentage of DPOs believe that they should be consulted on 
all matters related to data protection, emphasizing the importance they attribute to their role 
in safeguarding data across various contexts. 
86.24  %  (2614)  of  DPOs  receives  only  0-10  requests  from  its  co-workers  related  to  data 
protection on monthly basis. 
Only 23.72 % (719) of DPOs participates and gives advice on data protection questions all the 
time (100%). 38.4 % (1164) of DPOs spend less 5% of their time to participate and give advice 
on data protection questions. 
38.01 % (1152) of DPOs thinks that consulting with a DPO is necessary only on some questions 
related to data protection. 12.54 % (380) of DPOs think that consulting with a DPO on data 
protection question is not necessary. 7.03 % (213) doesn’t know answer to this question. 
87.2 %of DPOs receives only 0-10 requests from the data subject in relation to their data 
protection rights on yearly basis. – this is an indicator of low awareness on the role of data 
protection officer among Croatian citizens. 
In case when the organisation doesn’t follow the advice of a DPO, only 31.18 % (945) of DPOs 
document the reasons why the DPO’s advice has not been followed. 

2.  Article 38 (1) and Article 39 (1) (a) (b) (c) of the GDPR. 
3.  The  controller  and  the  processor  shall  ensure  that  the  data  protection  officer  is  involved, 
properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. 
In large number of cases this is not the case, DPOs are not aware that it is their duty to be 
involved in all data protection issues, employees of the organisation are not aware that they 
should seek advice of the DPO. Engaging in high risk processing activities without consulting 

 

57 

DPO exposes an organization to the potential of GDPR infringements. Seeking the guidance of 
the DPO is crucial to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with GDPR. 

4.  The  difference  is  again  between  private  and  public  sectors,  where  in  public  sector  the 

percentage of employees seeking advice of DPO is significantly lower. 

5.  Raising  awareness  of  top  management  on  the  importance  of  seeking  advice  of  DPO  and 
respecting  its  advice  in  all  data  protection  issues.  Raising  awareness of  employees on  the 
importance  of  seeking  and  respecting  advice  of  DPO.  More  engagement  of  AZOP  and 
organisations is needed in this matter. 

6) Independence of a DPO and reporting to the highest management  
 

1.  A significant number of DPOs receive instruction on how to perform its duties and DPOs do 
not  inform  the  highest  management  about  their  work  and  data  protection  issues  in  their 
organisation. 
35.3 % (1070) of DPOs receive instructions on how to do perform their tasks and duties.  
5.11 % (155) does not know the answer to this question and 6.6 % (200) did not give any 
answer.  
31.71 % (961) does not report about its work to the highest management not even once a year. 
(Čl. 38. st. 3. Opće uredbe o zaštiti podataka). 7.95 % (241) of respondents doesn’t know the 
answer to this question.  
28.44 % (862) of DPOs does not report to the highest management at all. 

2.  Article 38 (3) of the GDPR, Article 38 (6) of the GDPR. 
3.  This  is  a  big  issue  for  organisations  because  they  are  not  informed  about  data  protection 
concerns and issues in their organisations, and they will be held responsible in case of GDPR 
infringements and data breaches. The reason can be that they simply do not care about it. 
Compounding this issue is the constrained autonomy of the DPO who, rather than operating 
independently,  is  subject  to  directives  from  top  management,  thereby  limiting  their 
effectiveness in fulfilling their responsibilities. It is imperative for organizations to foster a 
culture  of  awareness  and  commitment  to  data  protection,  ensuring  that  DPOs  have  the 
requisite autonomy to execute their duties effectively. 

4.  The same difference between public and private sector as stated before. 
5.  Raising awareness and education of all relevant stakeholders. 

 

7) Guidance of the Supervisory Authority 
 

1.  72.52 % of DPOs would like more FAQs from data protection authority. 

46.45 % (1408) of DPOs would like more online tools. 
49.06 % (1487) of DPOs would like additional guidelines. 
67.73 % (2053) of DPOs would like more training materials and documents to be distributed 
within the organisations. 
In free text box there were following comment: 

•  There is a need for certification programme for DPOs (conducted by AZOP) 
•  There is a need for more educational activities 
•  There is a need for newsletter with information on various decisions of data 

protection authorities all over EEA 

•  There is a need for clear and precise legal advice from AZOP 

2.  Article 39 of the GDPR (39.1.b) (39.1.c) (39.1.d) (39.1.e) 
3.  Croatian Act on Implementation of GDPR doesn’t prescribe additional provisions concerning 

data protection officer. 

 

58 

4.  When discussing the expectations of DPOs from the Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency 
(AZOP) in terms of providing support for their roles, a significant challenge for organizations 
arises from a lack of clarity regarding the distinct responsibilities of a DPO and those of a data 
protection  authority  (AZOP).  Many  organizations  (DPOs)  mistakenly  believe  that  AZOP's 
primary function is to provide precise legal advice when they pose compliance inquiries. For 
instance, organizations often expect AZOP to take on tasks such as identifying legal bases, 
conducting Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIA), performing DPIA, and more. 
Frustrations emerge when organizations seek straightforward answers, such as, 'As a travel 
agency, do I have a legitimate interest in sending a client's personal data to a hotel?' Instead 
of  giving  precise  response  (which  of  course  we  can’t  do), we emphasize  the need  for the 
organization to conduct a balance test (LIA) if they wish to rely on legitimate interest and we 
give them a template with instructions on how to do it. DPOs very often perceive that AZOP 
duty is to do their job instead of them, leading to disappointment with our responses. 
There is a big difference between DPOs from public and private sector. According to Act on the 
implementation of GDPR: Exclusion of application of administrative fines to public authorities 

Article 47: Without prejudice to exercising the powers of the Agency laid down by the provision 
of Article 58 of the General Data Protection Regulation, in procedures conducted against public 
authorities,  an  administrative  fine  for  a  breach of  this  Act  or  the  General Data  Protection 
Regulation cannot be imposed on a public authority (state administration bodies and other 
state bodies, as well as local and regional self-administration units). 
 
Article 47 addresses the exclusion of administrative fines applied to public authorities in the 
context of procedures conducted against them for breaches of the GDPR or related legislation. 
While  this  provision  protects  public  authorities  from  monetary  penalties,  it  has  led  to  a 
concerning trend where organizations in the public sector disregard GDPR compliance, citing 
immunity from fines. 
 
An observed challenge within the public sector, particularly concerning DPOs, is the delicate 
balance they must strike between two fundamental human rights: the right to data protection 
and the right to access information. Many DPOs in public entities express uncertainty regarding 
whether they are permitted to provide access to information containing personal data. Despite 
comprehensive  guidelines  provided  by  the  Information  Commissioner  of  the  Republic  of 
Croatia, it appears that some DPOs may be reluctant to independently carry out the required 
balance tests, perhaps expecting external entities to fulfill this responsibility on their behalf. 
 
Notably,  there  is  a  notable  discrepancy  in  GDPR  compliance  across  sectors.  DPOs  in  the 
education and health sectors often face challenges with limited knowledge and insufficient 
organizational support. In contrast, organizations in the financial sector demonstrate a higher 
level  of  commitment  to  GDPR  compliance,  typically  boasting  dedicated  privacy  teams  and 
substantial human and financial resources. Unfortunately, DPOs in the education and health 
sectors  find  themselves  grappling  with  compliance  hurdles  without  commensurate 
organizational backing. 
 
Another sector requiring attention is tourism, where substantial compliance issues have been 
identified alongside a lack of understanding of the DPO's role. Factors contributing to non-
compliance include low awareness of the importance of personal data protection, a general 
disregard for data protection principles, and the perception of personal data as a lucrative 
source of income. In this sector, personalized offers for guests and the sharing of guest data 

 

59 

with  other  organizations  are  seen  as  revenue-generating  strategies,  overshadowing  the 
imperative to adhere to data protection regulations. 
 
Another problem is that performing his/her duties as a DPO in most cases is not the main job 
of a DPO but additional task, and DPOs are not paid for this additional work. Consequently, 
DPOs are not motived to do their job properly. 
 
More  support  for  DPOs  from  AZOP  and  organisations  is  needed  and  more  fines  for 
organisations who don’t give enough time, budget and independency to their DPOs. 
 
In conclusion, the observed challenges highlight the need for increased awareness, education, 
and support, particularly within the education, health, and tourism sectors, to ensure effective 
GDPR compliance and safeguard individuals' rights to data protection. 

5.  Addressing the challenge at hand requires a multi-faceted approach, focusing on enhanced 
support from AZOP for DPOs and imposing stricter penalties on organizations that appoint 
DPOs merely for formal reasons without providing them the necessary resources and time to 
fulfill their responsibilities. 
From  2018  to  2020,  we  implemented  the  EU-funded  T4DATA  project  (https://azop.hr/eu-
project-t4data/),  designed  to  assist  DPOs  in  the  public  sector  in  understanding  GDPR 
provisions  and  integrating  them  into  their  business  processes.  Despite  developing  a 
comprehensive manual (https://azop.hr/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-dpo-_handbook_-
t4data.pdf), a persistent issue arises wherein DPOs often lack the inclination or time to engage 
with the valuable resources available.  
Presently,  we  are  actively  working  within  the  EDPB  Support  Pool  of  experts  to  create  an 
extensive DPO training program specifically tailored for the health and educational sectors. 
The anticipated launch date for this program is February 2024. 
Our commitment to empowering DPOs is evident through various initiatives such as regular 
training sessions (https://azop.hr/edukativne-aktivnosti-azop-a/), workshops under the ARCII 
project for SMEs, free online training sessions on demand, and collaborations with the Public 
School for Administration. In addition, we respond to each question received from DPOs in 
written, and they can also contact AZOP by phone. 
Recognizing  the  value  of  technology  in  education,  we  are  developing  an  online  tool 
(https://olivia.foi.hr/hr) aimed at assisting SMEs, with the belief that it will be beneficial for a 
wide range of DPOs. Additionally, our dedicated webpage for DPOs (https://azop.hr/sluzbenik-
za-zastitu-podataka-2/)  provides  a  wealth  of  educational  materials,  and  we  have  plans  to 
establish a DPO network for the financial sector by the end of 2023. 
Given our current resource constraints, the efforts we are undertaking represent the best 
possible support. However, we emphasize that organizations must share the responsibility by 
appointing  DPOs  with  the  requisite  knowledge  and  skills.  We  cannot  be  expected  to 
compensate for gaps caused by insufficient investments on their part. 
Regarding  DPOs  in  the  public  sector,  we  advocate  for  an  amendment  to  the  Act  on  the 
Implementation of GDPR. This amendment should empower AZOP to impose fines on public 
sector organizations found in violation of GDPR and the Act on the Implementation of GDPR. 
Such  a  regulatory  change  is  essential  to  ensure  accountability  and  compliance  across  all 
sectors.  Also  there  is  a  high  demand  for  certifications  schemes  and  certified  trainings 
conducted by AZOP.

Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
Yes.    We  have  developed  a  comprehensive  manual  for  DPOs  in  public  sector  available  at: 
https://azop.hr/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DPO-prirucnik.pdf. The manual consists of 215 pages 
and  describes  in a detailed way all the tasks and duties that a DPO in  public sector needs to perform, 
with practical examples and guidelines. Also, we have published a short brochure about the role and 
tasks  of  DPOs  https://azop.hr/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brosura-Zasto-je-vazno-imenovati-
sluzbenika-za-zastitu-OP 2021 e mail-version.pdf.  

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Yes, in the period from 2018-2021 Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency sent to all the public 
authorities in Croatia letters (around 6000 letters) concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the

Several data controllers in the public sector (public bodies) are still unaware that they are obliged to 
designate a DPO and are on the opinion that Article 37 of the GDPR does not apply to them. One reason 
for this is probably that some of the data controllers are not aware that they are performing public 
tasks and are therefore considered to be public authorities or bodies. (Although the survey did address 
this issue, it should be noted in this context, that it is also a common problem, that no DPO has been 
designated where it is mandatory according Article 37 (1) b) of the GDPR.) 
 
Regarding this problem (i.e. the data controller is obliged to designate a DPO but has not done so, or 
has designated a DPO but has not published his or her contact details and/or no notification to us has 
been made) the Authority have launched 29 inquiries ex officio this year and based on the results and 
communication of the CEF report more public bodies are due to be involved. 
 
We have experienced several times that the designated DPO holds a position within the organisation 
that includes the tasks relating to determining the goals and means of processing of personal data, or 
the DPO is a member of the highest management of the data controller. Some of the investigations 
mentioned above also cover the issue of conflict of interest. 
 
Generally and unfortunately data controllers are not fully aware of the tasks and position of the DPO. 
We are also aware of cases where the data controller was/is convinced that the national act on data 
protection applicable prior to the GDPR is the governing law, hence the data controller was/is not 
aware of the additional requirements and enhanced role of the DPO, and therefore the data controller 
did/does not provide adequate and sufficient training, knowledge on particularly important issues 
(such as on data security, risk assessment practices, data breach management) and resources for the 
DPO. 
 
A  relatively  high  proportion  of DPOs were/are  not  provided  any  trainings, materials  to keep  their 
knowledge up-to-date, and they would need much more resources for their tasks. Their knowledge is 
particularly lacking in the field of information security matters and information systems management 
and/or  development,  however  the  majority  of  respondents  feel  qualified  in  data  protection  and 
privacy matters, data protection processes and legislation on the processing and the protection of 
personal data. 
 
It also can be considered as serious problem, that some DPOs are/were designated by a high number 
(even more than 100) of data controllers, and therefore these DPOs are most probably not able to 
perform their tasks and fulfil their duties as they should. 
 
In terms of the officers’ activities, the percentage results corresponded to last year’s figures showing 
that a significant majority comply with their advisory tasks to be provided to controllers or processors 
and staff conducting processing work and the management of their entities typically request their 
professional opinion of the tasks specified under GDPR Article 39. However, similarly to the results 
experienced in recent years, the majority have not carried out any internal data protection compliance 
investigation or audit since their appointment, or if they have, they have not documented it and they 
have not prepared any plan for their activities, which could improve the prevalence of the principle of 
accountability, the level of awareness and transparency within the organisation. 
 
A possible solution to these issues could be the annual DPO conference organised by the Hungarian SA 
at the end of each year. Topics and presentations of the conference may focus more on these topics, 
which might have a positive impact on the relationship between DPOs and the Hungarian SA. 
 

 

63 

 

Inquiries or administrative procedures in the forthcoming months may also cover these issues. Some 
colleagues of the Hungarian SA are guest lecturers of 5 Hungarian universities give lectures to LLM 
programs available on data protection. Spreading the knowledge on the requirements for the role of 
the DPO may be one of the key solutions to the main problems.

Irish Supervisory Authority – Data Protection Commission (DPC) 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
Substantive Issue 1: The Resources of the Data Protection Officer (Article 38(2) GDPR).  
 
Data Protection Officers (DPOs) play an essential role, assisting organisations with their compliance 
obligations under the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. The DPO has numerous tasks as is laid out 
Article 39(1) GDPR. A DPO should be given the necessary resources to fulfil those tasks as stated in 
Article 38(2) GDPR. Organisations have an obligation to support DPOs when they perform their DPO 
tasks by providing DPOs with resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data 
and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge.  
 
The DPC noted the following findings from the questionnaire results: 
 

•  33% of respondents replied that they do not have the resources sufficient to fulfil the role of 
a DPO. The high majority 86% of these respondents came from Public Sector, Voluntary or Not-
for-Profit Bodies. 

•  Only 1 in 5 respondents answered that they can allocate all their time to performing the DPO’s 

tasks and duties.  

organisation.  

•  1  in  10  respondents  stated  that  the  role  of  the  DPO  is  only  a  part-time  resource  in  the 

•  Over 1 in 3 replied that the tasks of the DPO are in addition to other tasks performed by them 
in the organisation. Some of these tasks the DPC noted would not complement the role of a 
DPO,  such  as  Health  and  Safety  Officer,  Human  Resource  Officer,  Employee  Engagement 
Manager, and Communications Officer. 

•  Almost half of respondent’s do not have a designated deputy to assist them in their role.  
•  The high majority of respondents who stated they do not have adequate resources sufficient 
to fulfil the role of a DPO came from the Public and Not-for-Profit Sector. This supports the 
position that DPOs are better resourced in the Private Sector.  
 

It is vital that DPOs have adequate and sufficient resources to carry out their tasks as DPOs in an 
organisation effectively and that the DPO can maintain their expert knowledge (Art 38.2 GDPR). It is 
concerning that one-third of DPOs state they do not have the adequate resources for the role, and also 
that some large organisations only have a part-time DPO in place. A part-time position may lead to a 
lack of clarity as to what is expected in the role and diminish the importance of the role. Such resources 
can only have a negative impact on the compliance levels of data protection within an organisation. 
The  DPC  appreciates  that  ‘resources’  is  not  defined  under  the  GDPR;  the  DPC  recommends 
organisations need to consider the EDPB Guidelines on Data Protection Officers 
 
3.2 Necessary Resources which states the following should be considered by organisations.  
 

 

65 

• Active support of the DPO’s function by senior management (such as at board level).  
• Sufficient time for DPOs to fulfil their duties.  
• Adequate support in terms of financial resources, infrastructure (premises, facilities, equipment) and 
staff where appropriate.  
• Official communication of the designation of the DPO to all staff to ensure that their existence and 
function are known within the organisation.  
• Necessary access to other services, such as Human Resources, legal, IT, security, etc., so that DPOs 
can receive essential support, input and information from those other services. 
 •  Continuous  training.  DPOs  must  be  given  the  opportunity  to  stay  up  to  date  with  regard  to 
developments within the field of data protection. The aim should be to constantly increase the level 
of  expertise  of  DPOs  and  they  should  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  training  courses  on  data 
protection  and  other  forms  of  professional  development,  such  as  participation  in  privacy  fora, 
workshops, etc.  
 
Whilst the DPC recognises there is no one-size-fits-all, the DPC considers further clarity on what could 
be regarded as providing adequate resources for DPOs in an organisation may be helpful to address 
this situation. It may be the case that organisations need a template for what is required to have 
adequate resources in place for the role of a DPO.  
 
Substantive Issue 2: Conflicts of Interests (Article 38(6) GDPR).  
 
 Article 38(6) GDPR states: ‘The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller 
or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests’. The 
DPC noted in the submissions received that a number of DPOs alluded to performing other roles within 
the organisation. Some of these other roles may have the potential for a Conflict of Interests. Some of 
the roles noted included: 
 

•  General Manager  
•  Chief Financial Officer 
•  Chief Executive Officer 
•  Director of Corporate Services 

Whilst the GDPR does not prevent a DPO from fulfilling other non-DPO tasks and duties an organisation 
must ensure the DPO does not carry out tasks that will not lead to a conflict of interests or the impact 
on the independence of the Role of Data Protection Officer. The CJEU has recently held that a ‘conflict 
of  interests’  may  exist  when  a  DPO  holds  a  role  or  position  within  an  organisation  that  involves 
determining the purposes and the means of the processing of personal data. 43 
 
The DPC acknowledges in line with the CJEU decision that a conflict of interest must be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis and will be specific to the each individual organisation and their structure. The DPC 
recommends that organisations consider the published EDPB guidance in this which states  
 
Depending  on  the  activities,  size  and  structure  of  the  organisation,  it  can  be  good  practice  for 
controllers or processors:  
 
• to identify the positions which would be incompatible with the function of DPO 
 • to draw up internal rules to this effect in order to avoid conflicts of interests 

                                                           
43 CJEU C-453/21 – X-Fab Dresden GmbH & Co. KG  

 

66 

 • to include a more general explanation about conflicts of interests  
• to declare that their DPO has no conflict of interests with regard to its function as a DPO, as a way of 
raising awareness of this requirement 
 • to include safeguards in the internal rules of the organisation and to ensure that the vacancy notice 
for the position of DPO or the service contract is sufficiently precise and detailed in order to avoid a 
conflict of interests.  
 
Substantive Issue 3: Tasks of the DPO. Article 39 (1) (a to e) GDPR  
 
Question 15 of the survey asks ‘Have additional tasks been committed to the data protection officer 
compared to those envisaged in the GDPR?‘. 
 
The DPC noted that the following other tasks are carried out by the DPO.  
 

•  nearly 1/3 of DPOs are involved in the decision making on the processing of personal data  
•  Over half develop the organisation’s data protection processes.  
•  Over half draft or carry out data protection impact assessments  
•  Over half fulfil the data subject requests on their data protection rights  
•  Almost half draft or negotiate contract such as data processing agreements.  
•  Over 25% are responsible for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data.  

 
The DPC notes following responses received that in practice, DPOs carry out considerably more tasks 
with more responsibility than outlined in the GDPR. The DPC notes that some of these tasks are better 
served by the organisation, not an independent DPO. For example, over 50% of DPOs, as an additional 
task, state they draft or carry out DPIAs. Whilst the DPO can play a vital role in carrying out a DPIA by 
being consulted for advice before or during a DPIA project, it is the controller's task rather than the 
DPO's to carry a DPIA when necessary (Article 35(1) GDPR). The DPC believes that DPIAs should ideally 
come from the controller and, specifically, the Unit within the organisation with the best expertise in 
the area of the DPIA. 
 
Positives.  
 
Article 38(1) and 39 GDPR  
 
The DPC welcomes that nearly all organisations have as a requirement that the DPO must be consulted 
on data protection issues, and for the most part, the DPO is involved or consulted in handling and 
solving  problems  related  to  the  processing  and  protection  of  personal  data  in  the  organisation. 
(Q25/26). The  DPC  also  sees  as  a  positive  that  almost  all  DPOs  stated  that,  in  general,  the DPO's 
opinions are being followed in the organisation and that the high majority, nearly 75% of DPOs, are 
documenting  why  their  advice  is  not  being  pursued  for  example,  why  a  DPIA  was  not  deemed 
necessary prior to the undertaking of a project. The DPO's recording of why their advice is not followed 
and their decision-making process will assist an organisation in meeting its accountability obligations 
under Article 5(2) GDPR. 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

67 

 

 

The DPC has published guidance on appropriate qualifications for a Data Protection Officer at the 
following link44.  
 
The guidance recommends that the appropriate level of qualification and expert knowledge should be 
determined according to the personal data processing operations carried out, the complexity and scale 
of data processing, the sensitivity of the data processed and the protection required for the data being 
processed. 

The DPC has published guidance on Who Needs a DPO under Article 37(1) GDPR?45. 

The DPC has guidance published on how to notify the DPC of notifying the DPC of a DPO under Article 
37 (7) GDPR46. 

The DPC also has an FAQ document on the DPC DPO notification/registration process47. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Pursuant to its tasks of a supervisory authority contained in Article 57 of the GDPR, in 2020, the DPC 
commenced a project to assess compliance by public bodies with the Article 37 (1) obligations. From a 
total of almost 250 public bodies, comprising Government Departments and agencies, as well as Local 
Authorities, 77 public bodies were identified as being potentially not compliant with the requirements. 
Engagement with each of these public bodies to bring themselves in to compliance with Article 37.7 of 
the GDPR by the end of 2020, raising the sector’s compliance rate from 69% to 96%.  
 
The DPC carried out an Own-Volition Inquiry into one of the public bodies as a result of the monitoring 
and enforcement exercise above48. Pursuant to the tasks of a supervisory authority contained in Article 
57 of the GDPR following which the decision issued the body with a with a reprimand in respect of the 
infringements of Articles 31, 37(1), and 37(7) of the GDPR.

The DPC participated in the 2023 CEF as a fact-finding exercise to feed into the wider EDPB CEF. The 
answers received will assist the DPC in gaining greater insights into the designation and position of the 
Data Protection Officer and assist the DPC in supporting DPOs in their role. The answers received will 
not lead to any formal actions or investigations by the DPC. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The  DPC's  general  impression  of  the  levels  of  awareness  and  compliance  of  the  organisations 
concerning the designation, tasks and role of the DPO in general is quite high. In the large majority, 
almost 80% of DPOs replied they have at least 3 + years of experience working on the application and 
the interpretation of data protection requirements (Art 37.5 GDPR). This level of expertise broadly 
matched the DPO’s relevant experience working in the organisation's particular industry with over 50% 
stating they have 8+ years in organisations industry or field.  
 
The DPC is concerned, however, that the DPO role in some organisations is considered part-time and 
as previously noted, this may have an impact on the effectiveness of the role. It was noted that this 
situation  arose  more  in  the  voluntary  and  not-for-profit  sectors,  which  may  indicate  budgetary 
constraints in those sectors as opposed to organisations in the private sector. In some cases, the DPO 
could allocate as little as 10% or 20 % of their working hours to performing their tasks and duties, likely 
impacting effective data protection compliance in an organisation.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Designation of the DPO 

 

1.  As regards the public sector, it has been declared that the DPO sometimes belongs to the top 
management and this circumstance must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to verify the 
existence of possible conflicts of interest. In the private sector, it emerged that in some cases 
one DPO was designated for the entire business group, made up of numerous subsidiaries 
(e.g.: in one case, 53 subsidiaries designated the same DPO). Furthermore, it was found that 
in one case the DPO's contact details were communicated to the Authority only by the holding 
company and not by the subsidiary company, which is established in Italy and acts as data 
controller. 

2.  Article 38 (6), Article 37 (2), (7), Article 39 GDPR. 
3.  These are conducts that may give rise to a violation of the provisions on the protection of 
personal data set out in the GDPR. With particular reference to the designation of a single DPO 
by  several  controllers,  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  designated  DPO  should  be  able 
nevertheless to provide the necessary support to all the controllers (also in terms of time and 
resources) and perform the tasks under Article 39 adequately. Furthermore, with reference to 
the case reported above, it is to be highlighted that the communication of the DPO's contact 
details to the SA as well as their publication are necessary in order to enable both the SA and 
data subjects to contact the DPO in an easy and direct way. Indeed, although Article 37 (7) 
allows designating a single DPO on behalf of several controllers/companies, this does not do 
away with the obligation for every controller to communicate the DPO’s contact details to the 
SA and to publish them. 

4.  There are many  differences  between organisations and  this  is  a  limited  problem  and only 

detected in specific cases. 

5.  General guidance, implementation of training and updating processes, revising the Guidelines 
on data protection officers (WP 29 n. 243 Rev. 01), possible initiation of individual proceedings 
and imposition of corrective measures, exchanges with and suggestions to data controllers. 

2) Knowledge and experience of the DPO  

1. 

 
In some cases, in the public sector, DPOs have declared that they do not have specialized 
expertise in data protection matters, however they have sometimes stated they were familiar 
with the relevant legislation. In the recruitment procedures, specific skills or experience were 
sometimes not required. In some cases, no training periods were foreseen for DPOs. On the 
contrary, widespread specialist knowledge has emerged in the private sector and DPOs follow 
several training courses of several hours’ duration throughout the year. 

2.  Article 37 (5) GDPR. 

 

70 

3. 

It may give rise to a violation of the GDPR. In particular, appointing a DPO without professional 
qualities and specific expertise nullifies the rationale of the appointment and the contribution 
the DPO can give to the controller’s organization. 

4.  With respect to this specific issue, there is a certain difference between DPOs operating in the 

public sector and those operating in the private sector. 

5.  General guidance, implementation of training and updating processes, revising the Guidelines 
on data protection officers (WP 29 n. 243 Rev. 01), possible initiation of individual proceedings 
and imposition of corrective measures, exchanges with and suggestions to data controllers. 

3) Tasks and resources of the DPO  

 

1.  Sometimes,  in  the  public sector,  the  controller’s management  has  not clearly defined  and 
provided a written description of the DPO's duties. Sometimes the DPO discharges additional 
tasks  and  the  DPO-related  activities  are  not  the  main  task  of  the  designated  person  who 
devotes less than 5% of their time to discharging the relevant duties. In some cases, the staff 
is not enough and in almost all  cases, no deputy has been appointed, whilst the available 
resources are considered insufficient. In the private sector, on several occasions DPOs have 
declared  that  they  do  carry  out  other  tasks  and  have  insufficient  resources  and  time  to 
discharge their tasks as DPOs (less than half responded that they manage to dedicate 50% of 
their time to their DPO function due to additional tasks). In terms of resources, while on the 
one hand the staff available to the DPO is considered adequate and a budget is allocated, only 
half  of  the  DPOs  in  the  private  sector  responded  that  they  could  manage  the  budget 
independently. Finally, it should be noted that a minority of DPOs indicated that the controller 
had appointed a deputy. 

2.  Articles 38 (2), (6), 39 GDPR. 
3. 

It may give rise to a violation of the GDPR. In particular, if the DPO carries out several other 
tasks, poor efficiency or incompatibility or conflicts of interests may arise as the performance 
of further tasks could prevent them from usefully fulfilling their duties as DPOs (especially if 
their additional tasks entail a workload that ultimately hampers the performance of the DPO's 
duties). In other cases, such multiple tasks might prevent the DPOs from acting independently 
(for example where the other roles covered by the DPO within the organization entail the 
determination of the purposes or means of the processing of personal data). 

4.  There are many  differences  between organisations and  this  is  a  limited  problem  and only 

detected in specific cases. 

5.  General guidance, implementation of training and updating processes, revising the Guidelines 
on data protection officers (WP 29 n. 243 Rev. 01), possible initiation of individual proceedings 
and imposition of corrective measures, exchanges with and suggestions to data controllers. 

4) Role and position of the DPO 

  
In the public sector, there remain cases where the DPO is not consulted on issues relating to 
the protection of personal data and does not receive sufficient information on the relevant 
issues.  The  DPO  is  generally  not  expected  to  report  regularly  to  the  highest  level  of 
management in the organization. Sometimes the DPO's contact details are published on the 
website, but not in the privacy policy. In the private sector, conversely, the involvement of 
DPOs in data protection issues was found to be thorough. Also in the private sector, it was 
found that the DPO does not report directly to the top management in most cases as they 
rather report to other functions in the organization’s structure. Cases were found in both the 

71 

1. 

 

public and private sectors in which the controller did not document the reasons why the DPO's 
opinion was disregarded. 

2.  Articles 13 (1); 38 (1), (3); 39 (1) GDPR. 
3. 

It may give rise to a violation of the GDPR. In particular, where there is little involvement of 
the DPO, this voids the relevant appointment of any significance and therefore trumps the 
privacy  by  design  and  by  default  approach  promoted  by  the  GDPR  -  which  may  entail 
consequences for the controller in terms of accountability and non-compliance with the GDPR. 
As to the situations where the DPO does not report directly to the top management, this may 
jeopardise the independent discharge of the relevant tasks. 

4.  Some  differences  were  found  between  DPOs  operating  in  the  public  sector  and  those 
operating in the private sector with regard to the involvement of the DPO on issues relating to 
the protection of personal data. However, in both the private and the public sector, the DPO 
is not expected to report regularly to the organisation’s top management in the majority of 
cases. 

5.  General guidance, implementation of training and updating processes, revising the Guidelines 
on data protection officers (WP 29 n. 243 Rev. 01), possible initiation of individual proceedings 
and imposition of corrective measures, exchanges with and suggestions to data controllers. 

2.  None. 
3. 
4.  N/A. 
5. 

5) Guidance of the Supervisory Authority 

1. 

 
In many cases it was stated by the DPOs that they would like to be able to take advantage of 
further  guidance  from  the  Supervisory  Authority  such  as  FAQs,  online  tools,  guidelines, 
materials for the training of the DPO, materials for use by the DPO for the internal training of 
the personnel, and that publication of the contact details of the DPOs by the SA would be 
helpful as well. In the public sector, in one case the request was made to develop ‘Templates 
to draft a comprehensive regulatory instrument addressing the structure and legal positioning 
of the DPO and the respective Staff Office by having regard to the tasks and size of the public 
authority/ related Organisation’. 

It would be useful to provide DPOs with tools to better perform their tasks. 

Identifying ways to disseminate what has already been developed by the individual European 
SAs over time in a more structured manner, also in light of the Final CEF Report published by 
the EDPB; developing common tools and decisions at European level, taking into account in 
any case that there is no ultimate best practice, much less so a ‘one-size-fits-all’ best practice 
at EU level, and that it is up to controllers to identify the best and most effective solution by 
having regard to the context in which they operate – in line with the accountability principle. 

 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines

of DPOs in the public sector] 
Documento di indirizzo su designazione, posizione e compiti del... - Garante Privacy51 

These  Guidelines  were  adopted  following  investigations  into  complaints,  alerts  and  questions 
submitted to the SA as well as on the basis of specific inspections concerning companies that provide 
DPO services to public bodies and in connection with a comparative analysis carried out with the SAs 
of other EU countries in the form of voluntary mutual assistance requests. The Guidelines provide 
clarifications on several issues concerning the role, position and tasks of the DPO in the public sector 
and suggest measures to strengthen the DPO’s role in public administrations. Reference can be made 
in particular to the following: enhancing the role of the DPO as a contact point for the SA at the 
organisation; issues relating to the obligation to appoint a DPO; issues concerning the choice of an 
external  DPO;  publication  and  communication  of  the  DPO's  contact  details;  involvement  of  the 
controller, performance of the DPO’s tasks and setting up a team of collaborators; incompatibility with 
other roles and conflicts of interests concerning both internal and external DPOs. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
The Garante has taken action with several decisions addressed at various data controllers in the 
public sector (including entities other than those involved in circulation of the CEF questionnaire).

in  focus’,  which  took  place  on  23  June  2023 

 
Furthermore, it should be taken into account that non-enforcement related activities were also carried 
out, such as public meetings promoted by the Authority, among other things, with the DPOs from 
Ministries, the financial administration, research organisations and the University, and banks aimed at 
fostering  ‘networking’  actions  with  a  view  to  strengthening  their  position  vis-à-vis  the  respective 
controllers. Additionally, campaigns were carried out over the years aimed at urging local authorities, 
in particular, to communicate the contact details of their DPOs. The IT SA has already implemented 
several initiatives relating to the DPO’s role and mission (most recently, a national conference called 
‘The  DPO 
in  Bologna:  https://www.gpdp. 
it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9901692), within which ideas and proposals 
emerged which are currently being evaluated. These contributions could be matched with the results 
of the questionnaire and could ultimately lead to initiatives of different nature - including regulatory, 
institutional, awareness-raising or training ones. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
If criticalities are detected, ad-hoc investigations will be opened to evaluate whether to adopt specific 
corrective measures against the data controllers, and possibly also general decisions by the Authority 
if  common  issues  are  found  in  different  sectors  so  as  to  provide  guidance,  recommendations  or 
suggestions.  
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Good, although some shortcomings have been found which point to the need for raising awareness 
among controllers regarding designation, role, professional preparation and involvement of the DPO 
in matters relating to the protection of personal data. 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 

In any case, it would be necessary to promote awareness of data protection issues within organizations 
so  as  to  ensure  that  the  DPO  is  perceived  as  a  resource  rather  than  an  obstacle/cost  or  a  mere 
bureaucratic requirement for the controller.

LI SA 

Liechtenstein Supervisory Authority – Datenschutzstelle Fürstentum Liechtenstein 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
Issue 1 (the designation, knowledge and experience of the DPO / tasks and resources of the DPO): 
Conflict of interests  
  

1.  A number of DPOs seem to hold positions in their organisation which could give rise to a 
conflict of interest. In fact, some answers given in the survey highlight that some DPOs hold 
positions or have duties related to the (highest) management level of their organisation, where 
they have to make final and binding decisions on data processing activities. This may lead to 
conflicts with their tasks as DPOs when they have to evaluate, scrutinize and possibly criticise 
data processing activities in a free and independent manner. 

2.  Art. 38 (6) GDPR. 
3. 

If a member of the (highest) management level acts simultaneously as a DPO, the organisation 
might be induced to engage in riskier data processing activities than if an independent DPO 
advised them. This might lead to higher risks for the data subjects concerned but also for the 
organisation itself. 

4.  Most organisations are aware of this issue and have appointed a DPO who is not part of the 
(highest)  management.  This  ensures  that  the  DPO  can  perform  his/her  tasks  completely 
independently with no conflicts of interest. 

5.  Organisations with a DPO that might not be free of conflicts of interest should appoint another 
person as DPO and even are bound to do so in accordance with Article 38 (6) GDPR. The LI SA 
will  raise  awareness  about  this  issue  in  its  upcoming  communication  to the  DPOs  in  LI.  In 
particular, the LI SA will draw attention to the obligation resulting from Article 38 (6) GDPR. 

Issue 2 (the designation, knowledge and experience of the DPO): Insufficient training  
  

1.  One third of the DPOs answering the questionnaire have only a maximum of 8 hours (one day) 
of training available to them per year in order to maintain, train and further their professional 
qualification and expert knowledge on data protection law and practices. In view of the LI SA, 
the scarce time allocated to them per year is not enough to deepen their knowledge in the 
required areas given that data protection is a very dynamic and complex legal area. 

2.  Art. 38 (2) GDPR. 
3.  Most DPOs answering the questionnaire are not performing their task as DPO on a full-time 
basis. In order to be able to truly monitor the organisation’s compliance with data protection 
law, it is essential that DPOs are afforded enough time to maintain and develop and expand 
their professional expertise and knowledge. Especially in the dynamic area of data protection 
law, where case law continually influences the interpretation of the GDPR and national data 
protection law as well as the corresponding practices in organisations, DPOs require enough 

 

76 

time for training made available to them. This is the only way for DPOs to keep up with legal 
developments and to correctly advise their organisations. 

4.  The other two thirds of DPOs answering the questionnaire are afforded more than one day of 
training  per  year  in  order  to  maintain  or  train  their  professional  qualification  and  expert 
knowledge on data protection law and practices. 
In the view of the LI SA, all organisations should afford their DPOs a minimum of two days of 
training per year in order to maintain and develop and expand their professional qualities and 
expert knowledge on data protection law and practices. The LI SA will raise awareness about 
this issue in its upcoming communication to the DPOs in LI. 

5. 

Issue 3 (the tasks and resources of the DPO): Lack of written description of tasks 
  

1.  Some DPOs answering the questionnaire have indicated that their management has not clearly 
defined the tasks incumbent on DPOs and has not provided them with a written description of 
the their tasks. 

2.  Art. 38 GDPR (However, there is no specific legal requirement to have a written description of 

the DPOs’ tasks.) 

3.  None of the DPOs answering the questionnaire has indicated a specific problem arising from 
this  issue.  Nevertheless,  if  the  tasks  of  the  DPO  are  not  clearly  defined  and  no  written 
description is given to the DPO at the beginning of his/her appointment (besides the tasks 
written down in the GDPR and national data protection legislation), there might arise conflicts 
between the DPO and the management: If it is not clear what exactly the DPO is expected to 
do and what not, or in which way he or she is expected to support the management in data 
protection matters, then he or she – acting independently – will define this himself/herself, 
irrespective of whether it corresponds with the expectations of the management or not. It 
shall be noted that a conflict between the DPO and the management about the competences 
and tasks of the DPO will always be to the detriment of data protection and the data subjects 
concerned. 

4.  Almost 75% of the DPOs answering the questionnaire have indicated that their management 
has clearly defined their role as DPO and provided them with a written description of their 
tasks. 

5.  Organisations that have not done so yet should clearly define the tasks and provide their DPOs 
with a written description of their tasks as soon as possible. This will help to avoid potential 
conflicts between the DPO and the management. The LI SA will raise awareness about this 
issue in its upcoming communication to the DPOs in LI. 

Issue 4 (the tasks and resources of the DPO): Responsibility beyond legal duties 
  

1.  Most of the DPOs answering the questionnaire have indicated that additional tasks have been 
committed  to  them  compared  to  those  strictly  envisaged  by  the  GDPR  and  national  data 
protection law. Many of these tasks are not problematic and it seems logical that the DPOs are 
entrusted with them, e.g. developing the organisation’s data protection processes or drafting 
and negotiating data processing agreements. However, other tasks can become an issue, when 
responsibility  for  compliance  with  data  protection  law  is  shifted  from  the  management 
towards the DPO. This can happen, for example, when a DPO is not only advising on data 
protection  issues  but  has  to  decide  himself/herself  on  data  processing  activities  in  an 
organisation. Furthermore, DPOs run the risk of not having enough time for their actual legal 
duties if they are committed with too many additional tasks and responsibilities. 

2.  Art. 38 (6) GDPR, Art. 39 (1) GDPR. 

 

77 

3.  The responsibility for the processing of personal data always lies with the controller or the 
processor according to the GDPR and never with the DPO of an organisation. The latter is only 
supposed to monitor compliance with the GDPR and to inform and advise the organisation and 
its members on data protection. Accordingly, a DPO can never be responsible or liable for 
infringements of  data  protection  law,  if  he or  she  has  adhered  to  the  tasks  committed  to 
him/her by the GDPR and national data protection law. 

4.  Most DPOs answering the questionnaire have additional tasks to fulfil compared to the ones 
foreseen by the GDPR. However, these additional tasks – most of them not problematic – vary 
widely between DPOs. 

5.  Organisations should refrain from shifting responsibility for compliance with data protection 
law from the management towards the DPO. In cases where DPOs have to assume personal 
responsibility  for  decisions  or  the  lawfulness  of  data  processing  activities,  such  decision-
making tasks and according responsibilities have to be shifted back to the management of an 
organisation.  Furthermore,  organisations  should  refrain  from  burdening  the  DPO  with  too 
many tasks and responsibilities that go beyond his/her actual legal duties. The LI SA will raise 
awareness about this issue in its upcoming communication to the DPOs in LI. 

Issue 5 (the tasks and resources of the DPO): Lack of deputy 
  

1.  Only  half  of  the  DPOs  answering  the  questionnaire  have  a  designated  deputy.  The  LI  SA 
strongly recommends that organisations designate a deputy for the DPO in order to always be 
in a position to fulfil his/her tasks foreseen by the GDPR and national data protection law, e.g. 
to act as the contact point for the SA. 

2.  Art. 38 (4) GDPR, Art. 39 GDPR. 
3. 

If no deputy is designated for the DPO, an organisation can face difficulties fulfilling all of the 
tasks of a DPO foreseen by the GDPR, if the actual DPO is absent due to vacation, illness, etc. 

4.  Half of the DPOs answering the questionnaire have a designated deputy. 
5. 

If not done yet, the LI SA strongly recommends all organisations to designate a deputy for their 
DPO. The SA will raise awareness about this issue in its upcoming communication to the DPOs 
in LI. 

Issue 6 (the role and position of the DPO): Insufficient involvement in data processing / data 
protection matters 
  

1.  Only about half of the DPOs answering the questionnaire indicate that they are usually (at least 
75% of the time) getting involved and/or are consulted in handling and solving issues relating 
to the processing and protection of personal data in their respective organisation. The other 
DPOs are frequently not consulted to the extent foreseen by the GDPR or – in the worst case 
– are simply ignored. 

2.  Art. 38 (1) GDPR. 
3.  According  to  Article 38  (1)  GDPR  an organisation  has  to ensure that the DPO ‘is  involved, 
properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data’. 
If a DPO is not properly consulted or - worse - is not consulted at all, such practice does not 
comply with Article 38 (1) GDPR. Furthermore, it increases the likelihood of non-compliant 
data protection processes and/or data processing activities in an organisation, which might 
lead to significant risks for the data subjects concerned but also for the organisation itself. 

4.  The degree to which a DPO is involved in handling and solving issues relating to the processing 

and protection of personal data strongly varies from organisation to organisation. 

 

78 

5.  As  Article  38  (1)  GDPR  states,  DPOs  have  to  be  involved  in  all  issues  which  relate  to  the 
protection of personal data in their respective organisations. The LI SA will raise awareness on 
this issue in its upcoming communication to the DPOs in LI. 
 

Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?

https://www.datenschutzstelle.li/datenschutz/themen-z/datenschutzbeauftragter.  In  this  guidance 
information is provided on the following topics: necessity to designate a DPO in an organisation, tasks 
of the DPO, cooperation of the DPO within the organisation and with the SA, liability of the DPO, 
communication of the contact details of the DPO, guidelines of the WP29 regarding DPOs. Additionally, 
an online form for communicating the DPO to the LI SA is available. 
 
Furthermore, we organise an annual meeting (training) for all DPOs in LI. In these annual meetings for 
DPOs the LI SA provides information about its work, recent jurisdiction, legal developments and also 
presents a varying topic deemed to be of importance for and of interest to the DPOs. 
 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
We have not taken any such action yet. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
We will inform the DPOs in LI at the next annual meeting in November 2023 about the outcome of the 
survey and about the main issues identified. Furthermore, we will remind the DPOs of the services 
offered by the LI SA to support them. Whether there will be any additional action beyond this has yet 
to be decided by the LI SA. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Based  on  the  survey,  our  general  impression  is  that  the  levels  of  awareness  and  compliance  of 
organisations  regarding  their  DPOs  are  satisfactory.  In  addition,  most  organisations  appear  to  be 
compliant with respect to Articles 37 to 39 GDPR. Furthermore, most DPOs seem to be competent and 

 

79 

sufficiently  equipped  with  resources  to  fulfil  their  tasks.  Notwithstanding  this  generally  satisfying 
impression some answers nonetheless gave room for some concern. However, given that the survey 
was conducted on an anonymous basis we are not able to detect those organisations which would 
require special attention by the LI SA. Therefore, as mentioned above, we plan to address these issues 
generally at our next annual meeting with all DPOs in LI and will invite them to seek support with the 
LI SA in case of need.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Conflict of interests due to conflicting roles or tasks.  
Some organisations have additional tasks assigned to DPOs, which include tasks relating to determining 
the goals and means of processing of personal data (e.g. decision-making on the processing of personal 
data and developing the organisation’s data protection processes). 
A possible conflict of interests will be investigated and guidance provided if necessary. 
2) Further guidance from SAs. 
All of the respondents are eager to receive further guidance from SAs and would like to be provided 
with Q&As / FAQs, or training materials or documents for data protection officers. 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
First, the Public consultation on the obligation to appoint a data protection officer63. A consultation on 
the assignment of DPOs in the private sector, which discusses the criteria, which is established in GPR 
Article 37 (1) (b) and (c). 
 
Second, the 2019-06-11 Recommendation on the appointment of data protection officers in the public 
sector and the peculiarities of their activity regulation64. The purpose of the recommendation is to 
draw the attention of authorities or institutions to the practice observed shortcomings related to the 
appointment of a DPO, ensuring his independence and regulating activities in government institutions 
or institutions. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
Analysing the responses provided during the preventive inspection, it is evident that the Institutions 
have appointed data protection officers who hold pivotal roles within their organizational structures. 
In many instances, the requirement to appoint a data protection officer is derived from the standard 
obligations of the GDPR, while in some cases, it is stipulated by alternative regulatory measures. This 
suggests  that  the  legislator,  when  enacting  these  additional  regulatory  measures,  has  taken  into 
consideration  the  escalating  risks  associated  with  data  protection.  As  digitalization  continues  to 
expand  across  virtually  all  sectors,  accompanied  by  heightened  demands  for  data  security,  the 
obligation to designate data protection officers has been duly established. 
The relationship between institutions that engage external service providers for the services of a data 
protection officer is akin to those that appoint specialists from their internal resources. This implies 
that institutions adopt varied measures to fulfil their data protection obligations. 
Despite being a relatively new profession, with more than 50% of practitioners having 6 or more years 
of experience in data protection, and nearly 35% possessing over 8 years of experience in the field. 
In general, the advice and recommendations of data protection officers are heeded in the course of 
the institution's subsequent activities in 94% of cases. 
While the overall survey results suggest that institutions generally understand and value the role of 
the data protection officer, it is evident that there is room for improvement in this regard. For instance, 
it is concerning that only 30% of respondents have designated a substitute for the data protection 
officer, which can be crucial when the specialist is on vacation or unavailable. 
Another  concerning  aspect  is  that  more  than  30%  of  institutions  provide  instructions  to  the  data 
protection  officer  regarding  their  tasks  and  duties.  This  raises  concerns  about  the  specialist's 
independence when they receive instructions from management. 
In  general,  the  survey  reveals  positive  trends  regarding  the  data  protection  officer's  role  in 
organizations.  However,  there  are  inconsistencies  in  some  areas,  possibly  due  to  a  lack  of  full 
understanding of the role. This underscores the need to continue efforts to strengthen the role of the 
data protection officer, enhance recognition, and emphasize its importance in the context of data 
protection.

Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
Issues identified during investigations 
1) Lack of resources and time afforded to the DPO 
During the investigations, the most emerging issue related to the notion of resources, which includes 
time afforded to the DPOs. From the responses received, it can be concluded that the majority of the 
DPOs do not solely focus on the role of the DPO in their work. In fact, only 22.02% can allocate between 
91% to 100% of their time to the DPO’s tasks and duties, with 73.39% saying that they do not have a 
designated deputy. This must be considered jointly with the fact that an aggregate amount of (65.12%) 
organisations have appointed a DPO due to Article 37(1) of the DPO – in other words, a DPO was 
appointed due to a requirement set by the GDPR.  
This issue relating to the time DPOs can allocate to their duties has also emerged in a separate but 
highly similar investigation conducted by this Office in early 2023, the results of which shall also be 
briefly considered in this Report due to their relevance. Over 80% of DPOs for public organisations 
have other roles and/or work responsibilities in addition to those of DPO. When asked for further 
comments, the lack of adequate time some DPOs have to dedicate to the tasks and duties related to 
the DPO was repeatedly stressed, with a significant portion of respondents stressing that their principal 
role prevents them from fulfilling their duties diligently. Particularly, in relation to the public sector, 
some DPOs have argued that the role should be a full-time one, and/or given adequate compensation 
for their role.  
Simultaneously, a general lack of resources was registered in the public sector. Contrastingly, however, 
77.06% of respondents in the private sector have said that there are sufficient resources in order to 
fulfil the tasks of the DPO. This is despite of the fact that the majority of respondents (52.29%) have 
said that there is no allocated budget to the office of the DPO. Out of the 30% who answered yes, only 
15% maintained that the DPO can manage the budget independently.  
Given this data, there seems to be a lack of clarity with regard to the time and resources allowed to 
DPOs. There seems to be a dissonance when contrasting the fact that the majority of the DPOs were 
appointed due to Article 37(1)(b) of the GDPR, and on the other hand the fact that most DPOs have 
other roles to fulfil.  
Imperatively, the chief solution to this issue is strengthening communication between DPOs and C-
suite  level  management  in  order  to  enforce  awareness  and  importance  of  GDPR  compliance.  The 
independent nature of the DPO is also somewhat alack based on the responses received, due to the 
fact that most of the DPOs in the private sector either do not have an allocated budget, or else they 
cannot manage the budget independently.  
 
2) Inadequate hours of training 
It is this Office’s view that another emerging issue as evidenced in the results relates to the training 
provided to DPOs. Question 12 asked the respondents how many hours of training the DPO is allocated 
in order to develop and/or maintain their professional qualities, on a yearly basis. Training, which falls 

 

84 

under the GDPR’s Article 39(2), imposes the obligation on the controller to ‘support the data protection 
officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out 
those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert 
knowledge’. It is concerning that the prevailing answer was between 1 to 8 hours a year (34.86% of 
the respondents marked this option), whilst an aggregate amount of circa 12% either said 0 hours a 
year, or ‘I do not know or wish to answer’.  
This issue is two-fold: 
On one hand, it is the obligation of the controllers and processors to support the DPOs and ensuring 
they are able to maintain their expert knowledge. Therefore, this is a scenario wherein controllers and 
processors are potentially in breach of their obligations at law. On the other hand, it is vital for DPOs 
to progress and strengthen their training due to the ever-evolving nature of data protection legislation. 
It  is  beneficial  for  DPOs  to  not  only  participate  in  internal/external  training,  data  protection 
conferences and similar event, but also have the opportunity to network with other DPOs in order to 
share experiences and practices.  
Having a majority where the DPOs are only provided with the minimum amount of yearly training is 
not  sufficient  for  DPOs  to  maintain  their  expert  knowledge  and  keeping  abreast  with  latest 
technologies and practices impacting data protection, and emerging rules or norms emanating from 
the Courts. An ideal solution to this would be the creation of a holistic and educative framework for 
DPOs,  which  would  include  a  yearly  continuing  professional  development  process  of  accredited 
courses, conferences, workshops and the like. Creating a minimum threshold of mandatory training 
for DPOs would not only ensure the maintenance of DPO’s expert knowledge on data protection but 
also a way for supervisory authorities to remain aware of issues DPOs encounter when fulfilling their 
duties as per the GDPR. 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
During the months prior to the launching of the coordinated action, the IDPC was investigating a data 
protection complaint with a local organisation operating in the insurance and travelling sectors. During 
the course of the investigation the DPO who was engaging with the office occupied the position of a 
Chief Executive Officer. Although this issue did not relate to the subject matter of the complaint, the 
IDPC took immediate ex-officio action to formally raise this serious matter with the controller. An order 
to bring the processing operations in compliance with the provisions of the GDPR was issued. The 
controller fully cooperated and complied with such order within the prescribed timeframe. 
 
 
2.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 

 

85 

Presently, this Office is not planning to undertake any action specifically based on the results of this 
report,  due  to  other  already  planned  and  ongoing  activities.  Having  said  that,  we  are  internally 
considering to provide more information targeted to DPOs both on our portal and also by making use 
of other communication methods. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The  overall  general  impression  is  encouraging.  This  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  the  replies 
provided by DPOs who stated that their advice and opinions are well received and followed by the 
controller.  Furthermore,  the  DPOs’  expertise,  gathered  through  questions  9  and  10,  is  broad  and 
adequate, with significant numbers showing that their knowledge corresponds with the requirements 
of Articles 37 – 39 of the GDPR. This is indeed important as DPOs play an important role within the 
data protection eco-system and therefore it is positive to observe that they have the necessary skills 
and expertise in this area. 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 

An  interesting  and  adjacent  point  to  investigate  may  relate  to  DPOs’  qualifications  and  possible 
certifications, since this questionnaire does not explore how DPOs obtain their expert knowledge. 
Although  the  GDPR  does  not  impose  an  obligation  for  particular  accreditations/qualifications,  in 
practice a myriad of standardized certifications are being recognised more and more.

Dutch Supervisory Authority – Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens  
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
Introduction 
 
The Dutch SA approached only DPOs that are registered with the Dutch SA. As a consequence, a 100% 
score  is  reflected  on  the  DPO  appointment  rate  of  the  approached  organisations.  Over  12.000 
organisations in the Netherlands have registered their DPO with the Dutch SA. 946 DPOs that were 
contacted completed the questionnaire. Of all responding DPOs, 370 respondents are active in public 
administrative organisations. 576 DPOs work in the private sector.  
 
Access to resources 
 
28,95% of the DPOs responded that, in their opinion, they have insufficient access to resources to carry 
out their tasks as mandated in article 38 paragraph 2 of the GDPR.   
 
If DPOs have insufficient resources available to carry out their tasks, it is likely that their supervision is 
less effective than it should be. This will not improve GDPR compliance in general. This is particularly 
a problem in cases where appointing a DPO is required by law.  
 
61,94% of DPOs responded that in their opinion, they have sufficient access to resources to fulfil their 
tasks. 
 
A solution could be to provide more guidance by the SA’s on the interpretation of the open standard 
of sufficient resources. The new guidance would allow for the DPO to explicitly report on their need 
for resources to the highest management level. Ultimately, enforcement by the SA could also be a 
possible solution to stress the priority as set out by the SA’s. 
 
Conflict of interests 
 
18,92% of DPOs responded that they are designated as DPO while also performing management tasks. 
The combination of both tasks could prove to be a challenge considering article 38 paragraph 6 GDPR 
(conflicting tasks and/or duties). 
 
In case of a conflict of interest, the DPOs cannot perform their duties independently. As a consequence, 
the  supervision  cannot  be  considered  independent, resulting  in  a  dangerous  decline  of the DPO’s 
oversight. 
 
37,63% of DPOs responded that they do not have other duties and/or tasks besides those of DPO. 
 

 

87 

A possible solution to prevent DPOs from having conflicting duties and/or tasks is to provide a list of 
roles  and/or tasks that  indicate  a  high  risk  and  are  deemed  as  incompatible (by  the  SA) with  the 
independent performance of the DPO's tasks. 
 
Instructing the DPO 
 
11,94% of DPOs responded that they received instructions by the organisation regarding their tasks 
and duties, despite this being a violation of article 38 paragraph 3 and 6 GDPR. 
 
The DPOs cannot act independently when an organisation provides its DPO with instructions regarding 
their tasks and/or duties. Consequently, it becomes increasingly difficult for the DPO to voice the 
necessary concerns when these arise.  
 
Additionally, any clear guidance by the SA could increase awareness among the organisations and 
DPOs on this subject. Enforcement on this subject should also be considered an option.  
 
Reporting to the highest management 
 
20,5% of DPOs responded that they do not report to the highest management as required by article 
38 paragraph 3 GDPR.  
 
When a DPO does not report to the highest level of management, it is questionable whether the 
highest management is sufficiently aware of the compliance level and the risks arising therefrom. 
Consequently, essential decisions made at the highest management level may be in violation of GDPR 
requirements.  
 
Note:  the  questionnaire  did  not  cover  cases  where  a  DPO  provides  information  to  the  highest 
management level without being in an actual two-way conversation. In addition, if the DPO does not 
report to the highest management, then it is not known how many levels below the DPO actually 
reports.  
 
72,41 % of DPOs confirmed that they report to the highest management at least once a year. 
 
Resolving this matter should be done along two lines.  

1. 

If access to top management is deliberately prevented, an enforcement measure by the SA 
may be most efficient. 
 

2.  DPOs should be stimulated to take the initiative to report to the highest management only. 

 
Documenting when the DPO’s advice is not followed  
 
28,85% of DPOs replied that their advice is followed poorly or very poorly by their organisations.  
 
12,89% of DPOs confirmed that when advice is not followed by the organisation, the reasons for this 
deviation are rarely or never documented. When organisations do not document reasons to not follow 
a DPO’s advice, it is in breach of article 5 paragraph 2 GDPR as it is not able to demonstrate compliance. 
The EDPB guidelines on DPOs confirm it is good practice to document arguments for deviating from a 
DPO’s advice. 
 

 

88 

The lack of the abovementioned documentation is an indication of poor overall GDPR compliance. If 
an organisation prioritises GDPR compliance, then it is inevitable to explicitly justify the reasons for 
deviating from the DPO’s advice. This justification can provide valuable insights to the data subjects, 
the DPO and the SA as required by the transparency principle. 
 
A possible solution is to provide more guidance on this so that these cases of a lack of awareness are 
reduced. In cases where deviation from the DPO's advice is intentional and undocumented, only the 
use of enforcement resources by the SA may be the appropriate solution. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The common solution in the abovementioned matters is to provide clear and concise guidance by the 
SA on the open standards regarding the role and positioning of a DPO. Preferably, this would be done 
based  on  updated  EDPB  guidelines.  The  issuing  of  clear  and  concise  guidelines  will  allow  all 
organisations to comply. Subsequently, if organisations fail to comply, a follow-up by enforcing the law 
seems like the logical next step.  
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
The Dutch SA has undertaken the following actions concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO. 
 
1. The Dutch SA has held meetings with the highest level of management of controllers to convey the 
required standards regarding the independent role and position of the DPO. The Dutch SA followed up 
on their meetings to verify if progress was being made. 
 
2. The Dutch DPO has asked written questions to various organisations about the combination of the 
DPO role and other tasks not related to the DPO role.  
 
3. The Dutch DPO has held meetings with the highest level of management of controllers regarding the 
termination of a service agreement of a DPO within the terms of that service agreement and asked 
written  questions  about  the  non-renewal  of  a  service  agreement.  In  both  situations,  the  DPOs 
indicated to the Dutch SA that they felt they were punished for their responsibilities as a DPO. 
 
4. The Dutch SA also had meetings with DPOs who contact the Dutch SA. Said DPOs believe that they 
are constrained in fulfilling their duties. The Dutch SA discussed possible solutions and appropriate 
actions with the DPOs. In some cases, these discussions led to an intervention by the Dutch SA and/or 
the DPO.  
 
5. The Dutch SA has a phone number and an e-mail address that are exclusively available for DPOs. 
DPOs can contact the Dutch SA about their questions relating to the role and position of the DPO and 
for guidance on GDPR related matters. 

89 

 

 
6. A newsletter for DPOs is published every quarter and the Dutch SA organises a national conference 
for DPOs on a regular basis. 
 
7. A position paper on the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO is available on the SA’s website.  
 
8. The Dutch SA has profiled companies in the Netherlands that may be required to have a DPO but 
have not provided a DPO’s contact details to the Dutch SA. 300 of said companies have received a 
written request to explain why they have not provided contact details of their DPO or substantiate why 
a DPO is not required for their organisation. 
 
2.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The Dutch SA will make an in depth analysis of the results before deciding on the actions. Nevertheless, 
it  is  clear  to  the  Dutch  SA  that  the  aforementioned  analysis  will  provide  valuable  insights  for  the 
purpose of prioritising actions and allocating the limited available resources. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The  Dutch  SA  has  the  impression  that  the  level  of  awareness  amongst  respondents  is  far  above 
average.  This  is  hardly  surprising  since  only  registered  DPOs  were  invited  to  complete  the 
questionnaire.   
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 

The Dutch SA found that in many meetings with controllers regarding the position and role of the DPO, 
awareness at the highest management level required additional training. In addition, open standards 
were often the point of discussion. Controllers oftentimes do not meet the requirement for DPOs to 
report to the highest management.

PL SA 

Polish Supervisory Authority – UODO  
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
The Polish Supervisory Authority - UODO, while participating in the CEF DPO action, decided not to 
send the form developed as part of the CEF DPO. This decision was due to the fact that, prior to the 
launch of the CEF DPO, the Polish SA had already sent 27 questions prepared by this authority to 
national controllers and processors (both from the public and private sector), which addressed the 
main obligations of controllers to ensure the proper performance of the DPO's tasks (Articles 37-39 
GDPR). More information on the Polish SA's action, as well as the questions sent by the authority, can 
be found on the website: https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1325. 
 
The entities to which questions were addressed by the Polish SA, exercising their powers under Article 
58(1)(a) and (e) GDPR, were requested to provide detailed explanations of the arrangements adopted 
for  each  of  their  obligations  under  Articles  37-39  GDPR  and  to  demonstrate  this  accordingly,  in 
accordance with the principle of accountability. Proceedings initiated following responses received in 
this regard are still pending. 
 
Therefore, in order not to mislead the entities as to the purpose of the previous action, Polish SA did 
not participate in the distribution of the form developed under the CEF DPO action, due to its own 
questions sent regarding the function of the DPO in the organisation and the national investigations 
conducted as a result. 
 
Therefore, Appendix 1.1 does not include the PL SA’s figures.  
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
In several entities, we have identified the problem where companies, which provided DPOs services 
(outsourcing),  provided  at  the  same  time  the  services  consisting  in  performing  on  behalf  of  the 
controller the so-called “implementation of GDPR” as well as other services related to risk analysis and 
assessment, handling requests and claims of data subjects, broadly understood information security. 
Thus, the same person decided on the rules for the processing of personal data, how to perform the 
duties  of  the  controller,  identifying  and  assessing  the  risks  associated  with  the  processing  and 
safeguarding of personal data, and then – in the performance of the position of the DPO – assessed 
the correctness of the decisions and solutions taken by the DPO, which led to situations where the 
DPO monitored its own activities, i.e. a conflict of interests, which is expressly prohibited by Article 
38(6) GDPR.  
In  accordance  with  Article  38  (6)  GDPR,  the  DPO  may  carry  out  other  tasks  and  responsibilities, 
provided that the controller or processor ensures that those tasks and responsibilities do not result in 
a conflict of interests. Due to the nature of the tasks of the DPO focusing on advising and monitoring 
the activities of the controller in terms of the compliance of personal data processing operations with 
the  data  protection  legislation  and  the  requirement  to  perform  this  function  independently,  the 
controller should not impose on the DPO tasks which, in accordance with the provisions GDPR, belong 
to the controller. Adopting a different assumption, where the DPO would be responsible for carrying 
out a specific task of the controller, e.g. breach notification, while monitoring the compliance of this 
task with the provisions on the protection of personal data, as required by the provisions of Article 39 

 

91 

(1)(b) GDPR, as a result, would lead to a situation where the DPO would de facto supervise its own 
activities, i.e. a conflict of interests. 
A conflict of interest occurs, inter alia, where the proper performance of the tasks of the DPO, indicated 
in Article 38(4) GDPR and Article 39 GDPR, with the implementation of other tasks, because there is a 
contradiction between the tasks, which prevents them from being properly carried out. In the case of 
a DPO, such a contradiction may result from the DPO acting simultaneously in two roles or taking 
actions or decisions, which must then be assessed in accordance with Article 39(1)(b) GDPR. 
A DPO with a special status in the area of ensuring proper compliance with data protection legislation 
must be guaranteed for this purpose appropriate conditions of operation, i.e. those which enable DPO 
to effectively, independently and correctly fulfil its obligations under the law, as is apparent from 
Article  38(1)-(3)  GDPR.  Imposing  obligations  on  DPOs  leading  to  a  conflict  of  interests  puts  into 
question not only the ability of the DPO to perform effectively the tasks to which it is required by Article 
39 GDPR, but undermines the very of the DPO institution, based primarily on the independence of the 
functioning of the DPO. 
In addition, the following problems were identified in several proceedings: the absence of procedures 
to ensure that conflict of interests are avoided, the conclusion of a data processing agreement with 
third-party DPOs at the same time, that runs counter to the provisions of Article 38(3) GDPR - the duty 
of  the  controller  to  ensure  that  the  DPO  does  not  receive  instructions  concerning  its  tasks,  the 
representation of controllers by the DPO as proxies, the failure of the DPO to be subject to the highest 
management of the controller, the failure to ensure that recommendations to the DPO regarding the 
sphere  of  data  protection  are  addressed  to  the  DPO,  failure  to  demonstrate  that  the  controller 
provides the DPO with adequate resources, including raising the level of expertise. 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
These guidelines and answers were published by the Polish SA both before and after the entry into 
application GDPR. Before the entry into application of GDPR, the Polish SA maintained an information 
website  dedicated  for  Information  Security  Administrators  (ABI)  -  the  predecessors  of  the  Data 
Protection Officers - where, in addition to explaining the functioning and status of the ABI, the Polish 
SA  also  provided  guidance  and  answers  to  questions  addressed  the  authority  regarding  the  Data 
Protection Officers and the GDPR. Since 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Officers’ tab has been kept 
on the website of the Polish SA, divided into the following sections: 

•  Designation  and  status  of  DPO  (present  UODO  website  -  https://uodo.gov.pl/pl/495,

In the tab called the Data Protection Officer, answers to questions raised by officers and controllers in 
this regard were published. The guidance provided was intended to facilitate their compliance with 
the obligations and tasks imposed by GDPR and to develop appropriate solutions tailored to their 
organisation. It addresses issues relating to the designation and status of the DPO (including, inter alia, 
detailed guidance on the DPO’s qualifications, conflict of interests, the assessment of the admissibility 
of combining position of the DPO with various other roles, clarifications regarding the exclusion of the

possibility to conclude a data processing agreement with an external DPO and providing the DPO with 
periodic resources) and the tasks of the DPOs (in particular which tasks are assigned to the DPO and 
which tasks are to be carried out by the controller and should not be transferred to the DPO). The tab 
also contains detailed instructions on the correct notification of the Designation of a data protection 
officer  to  the  supervisory  authority  and  the  publication  of  the  DPO’s  contact  details 
(https://www.uodo.gov.pl/en/679/1543) by the controller or processor on their website for the sake 
of data subjects. The DPO tasks section provided guidance on how to resolve the specific problems 
encountered by the controller in their practice in relation to the reasons for processing personal data, 
the  concepts  of  ‘controller’,  ‘joint  controller’,  ‘processor’,  ‘controller’,  obligations  and  answers  to 
questions concerning the making available of personal data. 
 
The authority stressed in its communications that the decision to select the appropriate person to act 
as a DPO must be taken in full knowledge of the controller’s responsibility for the compliance with the 
law. The controller must assess a number of factors before appointing a specific person to act as DPO. 
The controller’s assessment should take into account the effective availability of the DPO, the ability 
of the DPO to acquire detailed knowledge of the functioning of the organisation, the DPO’s availability 
of sufficient time for the scope of the tasks and the specificities of the data processing operations, the 
size and organisational structure of the controller and the need to avoid conflict of interests. It was our 
intention to provide such guidance as it was important to ensure that the DPO has the right status 
which translates into the proper performance of the DPO’s tasks. 
 
The Polish supervisory authority has repeatedly addressed the issue of conflict of interests and allows 
the  position  of  DPO  to  be  discharged  with  various  other  positions,  e.g.  a  classified  information 
protection officer, the head of the organisational unit, the IT system administrator, a barrister or legal 
advisor.  In  each  of  its  recommendations  on  the  status  of  DPO,  the  Authority  stressed  that  the 
assessment of whether there is a conflict of interests should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into  account  the  specific  circumstances.  This  means  that  the  possibility  of  a  conflict  should  be 
continuously monitored, as the causes of such conflict may also arise at a later stage after the DPO has 
taken up the position. In doing so, the controller should take into account, inter alia, the following 
criteria:  organisational  (the  DPO  should  be  directly  accountable  to  the  top  management  of  the 
establishment), substantive (other duties should not adversely affect the independent performance of 
DPO tasks), temporary (the DPO should have sufficient time to perform its tasks, taking into account, 
inter alia, the number of duties or the complexity of the duties). 
 
In  response  to  questions  from  DPOs,  the Polish  supervisory  authority  referred  to  the  issue  of  the 
obligation of the controller by providing resources necessary for the DPO in Article 38 (2) GDPR. This 
controller’s obligation is closely linked to the DPO's planning of work and the presentation of this plan 
to the controller (processor). The establishment of an action plan by the DPO facilitates the best and 
real use of the resources at his/her disposal as a DPO. The establishment of the plan helps to determine 
whether these resources are sufficient and whether, in all monitored areas, the DPO is provided by the 
controller  with  the  cooperation  of  those  who  process  personal  data  and  have  knowledge  of  the 
processing of personal data. It is important that the controller’s internal procedures are adequately 
regulated in this regard. Such a plan should take into account a multitude of factors depending on the 
specific characteristics of the controller and its processing procedure (activities). It needs to be aligned 
with the risk assessment carried out in the organisation and giving higher priority to areas that are of 
particular 
controller 
(https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/pl/225/1870). The provision of adequate resources and the work plan 
of the DPO should be reflected in the internal rules of the controller (processor).

In addition, a lot of information on this issue, as well as the proper performance of DPO tasks, can be 
found in the Data Protection Officers’ Newsletter, which has been issued cyclically since 2019. The 
‘Newsletter UODO for Data Protection Supervisors’ archives for the period April 2019 – November 
2022  is  available  at  the  following  link:  https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/p/archiwum-newslettera-dla-
iod/. Further numbers of the ‘Newsletter UODO for Data Protection Supervisors’ (since March ‘UODO 
Bulletin’) can be found at https://uodo.gov.pl/pl/p/archiwum-biuletynu-dla-iod. 
 
From 2016 to 2019, the Polish supervisory authority provided a cycle of free training for DPOs for data 
protection officers (DPOs) from selected sectors (e.g. education, medical, judiciary, foundations and 
associations, and social assistance centres). Sectoral training focused on new EU data protection rules 
and national legislation applicable to data processing in a specific field of activity. This training not only 
raised the level of knowledge of the DPO serving the industry, but also provided an opportunity to 
exchange experiences, solutions and good practices between participants in these meetings. We also 
delivered  a  training  cycle  on  selected  principles  and  obligations  stemming  from  personal  data 
protection provisions, e.g. transparency and compliance with information obligations (Articles 13, 14 
GDPR), transfers of personal data to third countries (Articles 44 to 49 GDPR), personal data breach 
notifications (Article 33 GDPR), carrying out a data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR). 
Separate training for DPOs was devoted to the provisions adopted in Poland on the basis GDPR. 
 
Since February 2019, the Polish supervisory authority launched a helpline for the DPO, which in March 
2020 was turned into a helpline for all stakeholders, including DPOs. 
 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
Since the beginning of the application of GDPR, both in the framework of ongoing investigations and 
in response to cases of non-compliance with DPO’s tasks reported to us, we have taken action under 
our powers, as set out in Article 58 of GDPR. Compliance with the provisions relating to the proper 
designation and functioning of the DPO was checked during the basic control activities. The control 
covered, inter alia, the obligation to designate an DPO, the notification to the supervisory authority of 
the designation or dismissal of an DPO, the provision of the first and last name of the DPO on the 
controller’s website, the position of the DPO in the organisation, the involvement of the DPO data 
protection issues, and the possible existence of a conflict of interests. 
 
In most cases, this verification was positive and did not give rise to corrective powers. It was only in a 
few cases that the UODO found irregularities in relation to the existence of the conflict of interests, 
e.g. the performance of the position of DPO by the municipal secretary, or the failure to consult the 
DPO of the personal data processing operations undertaken. 
 
Several infringements related to the performance of the position of DPO required corrective action by 
the  supervisory  authority as  set out  in  Article  58(2)  GDPR,  including  an order  to  designate  a  data 
protection  officer  in  a  housing  cooperative  and  to  impose  an  administrative  fine  for  the  DPO’s 
performance  of  his/her  tasks  without  taking  due  account  of  the  risks  associated  with  processing 
operations and of not involving the DPO in the processing operations carried out. 
 

 

94 

As  far  as  irregularities  reported  by  data  protection  officers  (and  sometimes  by  other  entities)  are 
concerned,  so  far  there  have  not  been  many  such  signals  and  they  have  mainly  concerned  the 
following:  

• 

failure to publish the DPO’s first and last name on the controller's website 
failure to update the DPO's contact details on the controller's website 
the adoption of procedures imposing on the DPO duties resulting in a conflict of interests 

• 
•  providing in the organisational rules that the DPO can be dismissed at any time 
• 
• 

the reasons for the DPO’s dismissal 
the positioning of the DPO in the organisational structure of the controller was incorrect: the 
DPO did not report directly to the highest management  
failure to provide the DPO with sufficient time and other resources necessary to carry out 
his/her tasks 
failure  to  provide  the  DPO  with  the  financial  and  infrastructural  support  as  well  as  the 
possibility to update knowledge 

•  omission of the DPO in cases concerning the processing of personal data (including those in 

• 

• 

which the controllers asked for the opinion of the Polish SA without asking the DPO first) 

 
In each situation reported by the DPOs pursuant to Article 58(1) GDPR. Points (a) and (e) of GDPR, the 
Polish supervisory authority called on controllers to explain the solutions they had adopted in relation 
to a specific obligation under personal data protection law, together with detailed and evidence-based 
information on the regulations and practices adopted to properly comply with that obligation. In all 
these cases, controllers indicated that they had taken steps to bring their activities in line with the 
DPO’s tasks by providing revised, detailed organisational arrangements for this purpose. Only one case 
was the subject of a decision in which the supervisory authority issued a reprimand finding that one 
hospital had infringed Article 38(6) GDPR, in so far as the hospital imposed on the DPO an obligation 
to grant authorizations to process personal data for the staff. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
In view of the identified GDPR infringements, it is envisaged to initiate administrative proceedings and 
to  issue  decisions  requiring  the  DPO’s  operating  conditions  to  be  brought  into  line  with  the 
requirements of GDPR and the imposition of fines in cases where there are grounds for such a sanction. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
It has been observed that, in some cases, the level of awareness is insufficient, whereby, as a general 
rule,  controllers  are  aware  and  comply  with  key  standards  stemming  from  the  rules  on  the 
performance of DPO’s tasks. 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 
 

 

95 

As part of our activities of verifying compliance with the DPO tasks in several organisations, we have 
identified the problem of the controller imposing on the DPO the task of maintaining a record of 
processing activities, resulting in a conflict of interests referred to in Article 38(6) GDPR. The DPO 
cannot take actions or decisions that must then be subject to his/her assessment in accordance with 
Article 39 (1) (b) GDPR. From the wording of Article 30 (1) GDPR it follows that maintaining a register 
of processing activities is the responsibility of the controller. 
 
In our view, the current wording of the Guidelines on Data Protection Officers WP 243 rev.01, allowing 
the DPO to carry out the controller’s task of maintaining a record of processing activities, leads to a 
conflict of interests prohibited by Article 38 (6) GDPR.  
 
In para 4.5. on page 19 of the abovementioned Guidelines the Article 29 Working Party indicated that: 
"In  practice,  DPOs often  create  inventories  and  hold  a  register of  processing  operations  based on 
information provided to them by the various departments in their organization responsible for the 
processing of personal data. This practice has been established under many current national laws and 
under the data protection rules applicable to the EU institutions and bodies." 
 
In a footnote, the Article 29 Working Party referred to Article 24 (1) (d) of Regulation (EC) 45/2001, 
which defined the designation and tasks of the DPO. In accordance with Article 24(1d), which is no 
longer in force, it was the responsibility of the Data Protection Officer to maintain a record of the 
processing  operations  carried  out  by  the  controller.  Nevertheless,  Regulation  (EC)  45/2001  was 
repealed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 
2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union 
institutions,  bodies,  offices  and  agencies  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data,  and  repealing 
Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC.  

The  current  Regulation  2018/1725,  as  well  as  the  GDPR  indicates  in  Article  30  GDPR  that  each 
controller shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. Furthermore, Article 
44(6) of Regulation 2018/1725 relating to the status of DPOs indicates (similarly to the GDPR) that the 
Data Protection Officer may perform other tasks and responsibilities. The controller or processor shall 
ensure that such tasks and responsibilities do not give rise to a conflict of interest.  

In addition, it should be pointed out that the practice of maintaining a register of processing activities 
referred to in the Guidelines has not been developed as a result of the application of the provisions of 
Regulation 2016/679, but of acts which were in force before the entry into force of that regulation. 

 

 

 

What is more, the Guidelines state that: “Article 39(1) provides for a list of tasks that the DPO must 
have as a minimum. Therefore, nothing prevents the controller or the processor from assigning the 
DPO with the task of maintaining the record of processing operations under the responsibility of the 
controller or the processor." 
 
Indeed, the list of the tasks of the DPO is not exhaustive, but Article 38(6) GDPR should always be taken 
into account when imposing other tasks on the DPO, i.e. that the tasks imposed by the controller on 
the DPO cannot cause a conflict of interest. 
 
It is worth mentioning that such recommendations as to the admissibility of maintaining a record of 
processing  activities  by 
its  website 
(https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/pl/225/659). In that case, Polish SA explained that it was in accordance 
with Article 30 (1 – 2) GDPR, it is for the controller to maintain a record of the personal data processing 
activities for which it is responsible and for the processor to maintain a record of the categories of 

the  Polish  SA  and  published  on 

the  DPO  by 

 

96 

processing activities carried out on behalf of the controller. Those entities are responsible for the 
effective implementation of that obligation and be ready to demonstrate this at the request of the 
data protection authorities. On the other hand, the Data Protection Officer, as a professional, can only 
assist the controller in establishing and maintaining records by, for example, advising it on matters 
relating to the implementation of that obligation. 
 
Another problem identified was the issue of giving the DPO a mandate to act on behalf of the controller 
(representation  of  the  controller)  before  a  supervisory  authority  and  a  court  in  personal  data 
protection cases. Although the Polish proceedings before both the court and the supervisory authority 
do not expressly provide for the data protection officer to be excluded from the circle of persons who 
may be legal representatives in data protection matters, the granting of such a power of attorney is 
contrary to the prohibition of entrusting DPOs with tasks giving rise to a conflict of interest (Article 
38(6) GDPR) and the prohibition of giving instructions to the DPO in the performance of his or her tasks 
(Article 38(3) GDPR). The task of the trustee is to protect the principal’s interests, act in accordance 
with the instructions and suggestions of the principal, which is contrary to the independence of the 
Data Protection Officer as guaranteed by GDPR. On the other hand, the DPO’s main objective is not to 
act solely in the interest of the controller, as demonstrated both by the scope of the DPO’s tasks and 
by the guarantees of its independence. The DPO’s main task is, inter alia, to monitor and advise the 
controller’s compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data. Therefore, the DPO’s role as 
representative in matters relating to the protection of personal data is in conflict with the prohibition 
on entrusting DPOs with tasks giving rise to a conflict of interest. The DPO, acting as the controller’s 
representative for the protection of personal data before a supervisory authority or a court, shall, on 
behalf of the principal, clarify the processing of personal data by the controller. Acting with the will 
and interest of the principal in these explanations, it could be forced to overlook its own observations 
and recommendations that it had developed as DPO. In addition to the above arguments, the Polish 
SA should point out that the DPO, in view of its role as an advisor and monitoring body independently 
of compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data, should, for its part, identify and alert 
the controller in good time to the risk of such a conflict. This makes it possible to prevent any potential 
conflict of interests in a timely manner. In such a case, the DPO should refrain from acting on behalf of 
the controller or terminate the power of attorney granted to him or her. 

 

 

Another  important  problem  raised  by  the  Polish  SA  is  the  incorrect  practice  of  concluding  a  data 
processing agreement between a controller and a DPO who is not an employee of the DPO. The Polish 
SA referred to this problem by publishing on its website answers to DPOs’ questions on this issue 
(https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/pl/223/2050, https://archiwum.uodo.gov.pl/pl/223/2092). The Polish 
SA pointed out that the conclusion of an entrustment agreement between the controller and the DPO 
was in conflict with the prohibition on instructing the DPO to perform the tasks and to avoid any 
conflict of interest. According to the GDPR, the processor is obliged to follow the instructions given by 
the  controller.  On  the  other  hand,  with  regard  to  the  Data  Protection  Officer,  the  controller  and 
processor are, inter alia, required to ensure that the DPO is not instructed to carry out his or her tasks 
(Article 38 (4) GDPR). In addition, the possibility for a person with whom a service contract is concluded 
to carry out tasks other than those laid down in the GDPR is limited by the prohibition of a conflict of 
interest in this respect (Article 38(6) GDPR).  

The essence of the above position is that the existence of a DPO as a processor who is to carry out data 
processing tasks in the name and on behalf of the controller and is required to comply strictly with the 
instructions given to him in that regard by the controller, undermines the DPO’s independence. On the 
other  hand,  in  the  controller-processor  relationship,  there  is  no  space  for  the  processor  to  act 
independently, in any way inconsistent with the controller’s instructions. For this reason, the DPO 
cannot act as a processor (be a party to the entrustment agreement) and act on the instructions of the 

 

97 

 

 

controller,  as  this  is  contrary  to  the  independence  of  the  DPO  guaranteed  by  the  GDPR.  This 
independence is necessary in order for the DPO to be able to properly carry out his or her tasks listed 
in Article 39 (1) GDPR.  

The controller and the external DPO designated by the controller shall combine the service contract 
referred to in Article 37 (6) GDPR. The purpose of this service agreement should be the tasks referred 
to in Article 39 (1) GDPR, implemented in compliance with the conditions laid down in the provisions 
of GDPR, in such a way as to guarantee the independence of the DPO. 

share? 

Access to the personal data necessary to carry out the DPO’s tasks shall be provided by law. Article 38 
(2) GDPR provides that the controller and processor shall support the DPO in performing the tasks 
referred  to  in  Article  39  by  providing  resources  necessary  to  carry  out  those  tasks  and  access  to 
personal  data  and  processing  operations,  and  to  maintain  his  or  her  expert  knowledge.  This  also 
applies to the external data protection officer performing his or her tasks under a service contract. 
 
3.  Are there any leading practices of the organisations you have contacted that you would like to 

 
Our  investigations  and  audits  have  shown  that  the  least  problematic  to  reliably  demonstrate 
compliance with the obligations under Articles 37-39 of GDPR had organisations that had carefully 
considered and subsequently implemented in their internal regulations specific rules and procedures 
adapted to their activities.  
 
This  accountability-based  approach  of  controllers  and  processors  was  already  emphasised  by  the 
Polish supervisory authority in its educational material. This approach was also guided by the drafting 
of  27  questions  created  to  verify  compliance with  the  provisions  regarding  the  DPO.  In  questions 
concerning, for example, the involvement of the DPO in cases of protection of personal data or conflict 
of  interest,  the  authority  indicated  that  information  should  be  provided  on  the  appropriate 
mechanisms (solutions, procedures) to ensure compliance with a given provision of GDPR.

PT SA 

Portuguese Supervisory Authority – Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados (CNPD)  
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
Introduction 
The PT SA decided to address the questionnaire only to DPOs and to do it directly. For that purpose, 
the PT SA used the contact details of the DPO, which were notified to the authority. The objective was 
to get the most accurate picture of their position, role and activities, without any kind of constraints. 
To reinforce this action, the PT SA decided to make the survey anonymous. 
The PT SA contacted the full universe of DPOs notified, even if they were representing more than one 
organisation. In such case, they would have to ask for an additional token to be able to reply to the 
questionnaire for each organisations where they are DPOs. 
Therefore, in total, the questionnaire was addressed to 2,671 DPOs of 2,671 organisations, and we 
received 625 replies, which represents about 23.40 % of the target. 
The questionnaire was available for the DPOs to answer during six weeks, between first of April until 
15th of May 2023. 
Since the questionnaire was anonymous and there was no possibility to identify the organisations, the 
PT SA has also collected some additional information regarding the nature of the organisation, sector 
and dimension, in order to obtain an overview of the organisations concerned and get a better reading 
of the results. 
It is interesting to highlight that 60.64% of the respondents were DPOs of private sector, while 39.36% 
were of public sector.  
Within the private sector, the majority of respondents (58.6%) were SMEs. In the public sector, the 
majority (64.22%) were DPOs from regional or local administrations. 
Based on the replies received, the PT SA identified the main following issues of concern: 
1) Potential conflict of interests 
One of the findings concern the potential conflict of interests between the tasks of the DPO and other 
tasks performed by the DPO within the same organisation, in particular related to highest management 
duties.  
This would be in breach of Article 38(6) of GDPR. 
Assessing  the  replies  to  Question  8  of  this  report,  related  to  the  department  the  DPO  belongs, 
whenever the DPO is a staff member of the organisation, it is noticed that almost 18% of the DPO 
perform functions at the highest level of management. When crosschecking Question 8 with Question 
25,  we  can  confirm  that  the  replies  are  consistent,  since  in  Question  25  also  about  18%  of  the 
respondents have as Management as an additional task/role in the organisation. 
This means that they are decision-makers as well, what most likely has consequence at the level of 
data processing, what constitute a conflict of interest with the DPO tasks. 
This situation does occur in an uneven way: about 2/3 for the private sector and 1/3 for the public 
administration. 

 

99 

 
2) Lack of training 
Another relevant finding relates to the lack of training made available to DPOs to develop or maintain 
their professional qualities and expert knowledge. 
This would be in breach of Article 38(2) of GDPR. 
When assessing the replies to Question 12 of this report, it is evident that there is a significant lack of 
training. It is observed, notably, that the majority of the DPOs (53.14 %) who have some kind of training 
does have less than 32 hours per year in training, what is less than a working week. 
In this question, the PT SA added a question to the common questionnaire, asking how many DPOs 
had  no  training  (zero  hours).  Surprisingly, about  11.5 % of  the  respondents  said  they  received  no 
training at all. In addition, it should be noted that almost 10% of the respondents did not know or wish 
to answer. Finally, only 25% of the DPO answered they had training for more than 32 hours per year. 
When  comparing  public  and  private  sectors,  one  can  detect  that  the  situation  in  the  private 
organisations is slightly better than in the public bodies, especially when it comes to training of more 
than 32 hours per year.  
This issue raises much concern, since in Portugal the DPOs have little experience as data protection 
officers, because before GDPR such role did not exist in the national legislation. When crosschecking 
with the replies given to Question 7, on the average duration of the DPO appointment, it is eminent 
that 65% of the respondents state they have less than 2 years in the job and, if extended that period 
for less than 4 years, we got a 94% of DPOs.  
Therefore, in a scenario where DPOs do not have much experience in performing DPOs tasks, the lack 
of training becomes even more significant as a problem to be tackled. 
 
3) Tasks unduly allocated to DPOs 
Another issue identified concerns the tasks assigned to the DPO by the organisation which are legally 
entrusted to the controller/processor and not to the DPO. 
This would be in breach of Article 39(1) of GDPR. 
When analysing the replies to Question 17, about the additional tasks committed to the DPO, it should 
be underlined firstly that almost 20 % of the respondents did not know or wish to answer, with split 
results  for  both  public  and  private  sectors.  In  our opinion,  this  high  percentage  is  an  indicator  of 
wrongdoing by the organisations. 
When  looking  into  the  tasks  description,  it  is  clear  that  DPOs  are  performing  tasks,  which  are 
incorrectly allocated to them. Instead of providing advice on DPIAs, internal policies and procedures 
and data processing agreements, for instance, the DPOs are drafting themselves the documents, which 
is a responsibility of the organisation. 
Considering the statistics, it is obvious that this deviation of tasks is much more notorious in the private 
sector than in the public, with much fewer cases. 
The  replies  to  Question  16.b  already  flag  a  problem  in  this  regard  when  around  77.30%  of  the 
respondents state that the DPOs are committed to the drafting and maintaining of the policies of the 
organisation in relation to the protection of personal data. 
It may also be pointed out that in Question 15 on whether the written description of the DPO tasks 
cover the actual tasks of the DPO in the organisation, a high number of DPOs (more than 20%) did not 
know or wish to answer. This may indicate that there are tasks unduly assigned to the DPO, which, for 
that reason, are not formally described.

4) Lack of independence  
A significant finding concerns the lack of independence of the DPO when acknowledging that receives 
instructions from the organisation regarding the exercise of his or her tasks and duties. 
This would be in breach of Article 38(3), first sentence, of GDPR. 
When assessing Question 32 of this report, it is noted that 28 % of the respondents answered that they 
receive instructions, which is a very high percentage for such a key-issue. Additionally, if we take into 
consideration the number of DPOs who stated they do not wish to answer (7.5%), the issue of lack of 
independence is likely to affect more than 35 % of the respondents. 
When comparing the public and private sectors, one find out that this situation is more problematic in 
the private sector (with a split of 2/3 for the private organisations and 1/3 for the public ones). 
The issue raised above, under C. on the tasks unduly allocated to DPOs and that are direct responsibility 
of  the  controller  or  processor,  may  also  be  linked  to  this  issue,  as  they  potentially  lead  to  giving 
instructions to the DPO. 
This is a very serious matter requiring to be addressed by data protection supervisory authorities. 

 

5) Lack of reporting  
Another important finding relates to the deficiencies in the reporting of the DPOs, reflected in the high 
numbers of DPOs stating that they do not report or they do not report to the highest management 
level of the controller or processor, even when such reporting is expected. Depending on how the 
questions were interpreted by the respondents, the answers may reveal that reporting is done to lower 
levels of management inside the organisation. 
This would be in breach of Article 38(3), last sentence, of GDPR. 
When  analysing  the  replies  to  Question  34,  it  is  observed  that  36.8%  of  the  respondents  say  no 
reporting is done, among those 178 DPOs state that no reporting is expected. It is also meaningful that 
almost 14% of the DPOs chose not to answer whether they report and how often, since they picked 
the option do not know or wish to answer, which might be an indicator that the legal requirement is 
not met. In this question, the lack of reporting is more evident in the private sector than in the public 
sector. 
These  results  are  somehow  confirmed  by  the  replies  to  Q35,  about  the  ways  used  for  the  data 
protection  officer’s  to  report.  In  this  question,  where  the  PT  SA  introduced  a  new  possibility:  no 
reporting at all, 21.6% of the DPOs selected this option. On the other hand, in Question 35, also 13.3% 
of DPOs picked the option do not know or wish to answer.  
Also relevant to retain that 17% of the respondents expressed to report in other way. This could mean 
that  the  reports  are  not  made  in  a  written  form  or  that  they  do  not  report  to  the  boards  or 
management group of the organisation but to a lower level.  
The answers related to the DPO reporting demonstrate, on the other hand, that the data protection 
officers may not be involved by the organisations in matters on which they should be consulted, in 
spite of the answers provided in Question 27 and Question 28 that show a high level of involvement 
on data protection issues. Furthermore, the lack of reporting may also be a hint that some DPOs may 
not be proactive enough in the exercise of their tasks. 
This is a matter that surely needs to be clarified as to the extension of lack of reporting and may benefit 
from guidance of data protection authorities on the interpretation of this legal requirement. 
 
6) Lack of resources 

 

101 

The majority of the respondents consider they do not have sufficient resources in order to fulfil the 
tasks of DPO. 
This would be in breach of Article 38(2) of GDPR. 
In fact, 346 respondents out of 625 flag this problem of lack of resources, what represents around 
55%.The situation has more impact in the public sector, where around 70% of the DPOs answered not 
having enough resources to perform their legal tasks. In the private sector, though still with a high 
percentage, when compared with the public bodies, the statistics is lower, achieving 47%. 
The replies to Question 23 on the allocation of a dedicated budget to the DPO function (only happens 
in  16%  of  the  cases  and mostly  in the  private sector)  may  be  a  plain signal that  the  allocation  of 
resources to the DPO is not a given fact or a standard resolution of the organisations. 
This is a very concerned issue, since it means that the DPOs acknowledge not being able to fulfil their 
tasks  due  to  the  lack of  resources.  The  kind  of  resources  is  not  determined  in  the  questionnaire; 
however  they  could  be  linked  not  only  with  financial  resources  but  also  with  human  resources, 
including  the  time  to  allocate  to  the  exercise  of  the  DPO  duties,  in  view  of  the  performance  of 
cumulative tasks (as stemming from Question 25 replies). 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
The PT Supervisory Authority provided guidance on two issues regarding DPOs in the public sector: 
 

•  Guidelines on incompatibility between the exercise of cumulative functions as data protection 

officer and as officer responsible for Access to Documents, of 11 April 202365. 

•  Draft Guidelines on the performance evaluation of staff when being also DPO, of 18 April 2023, 
and submitted to public consultation until June 202366. The final text has not been adopted 
yet. This guidance intends to safeguard the independence of the DPO when cumulating those 
tasks with other kind of work as staff member, while ensuring that the staff is not affected in 
his or her career for being a DPO. 

 
2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
The PT SA has opened several infringement procedures against local governments and other public 
bodies related to the lack of designation of DPO, lack of publication of the DPO contact details and/or 
lack of communication of such contacts to the data protection supervisory authority. The SA has been 
applying fines in this regard.

3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
This coordinated action was developed only as a fact-finding exercise. Therefore, the mainly objective 
is to get an overview of the situation of DPOs and to identify potential problems regarding the position 
and role of the data protection officer.  
 
The result will most probably lead to the issuance of recommendations and/or guidance to clarify the 
interpretation and application of the legal provisions, and thus, to contribute to reinforce the DPOs 
role within the organisations, as well as generally improve compliance with the GDPR. 
 
Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
The  replies  to  the  questionnaire  made  available  by  the  PT  SA  were  only  addressed  to  DPOs. 
Accordingly, their perception of the situation is relevant and might be more accurate as to the factual 
situation of the organisations. Based on that, our general impression is that there is a reasonable level 
of awareness but a significant deficit of compliance. 
 
When assessing the replies and crosschecking the answers, having into consideration that most of the 
respondents are from SME in the private sector or from local governments in the public sector, it seems 
that the position and role of the DPOs face major challenges within the organisations, in particular the 
ones of smaller dimension and resources. 
 
Apart from the main concerns already raised in Part II of this Report, it could be noted in general terms 
that the organisations that have designated a DPO chose a member of its staff; which in the great 
majority of the organisations do not perform their tasks in full time, but cumulate with additional 
duties.  
 
Besides, the majority of the respondents do not have any supporting staff (FTE) to assist them in the 
fulfilment of DPOs tasks, and only a few percentage have deputy DPOs. Moreover, it is evident that 
the  DPOs  perform  duties  related  to  data  processing  activities,  which  go  beyond  their  strict  legal 
functions and are responsibility of the controllers or processors.  
 
It should be also emphasised that, in spite of the positive trend to consult the DPO and follow their 
advice, in a significant number of cases it is reported that DPOs do not have enough information to 
fulfil their tasks. 
 
In conclusion, there are many visible shortcomings in the compliance of the GDPR related to Articles 
37 to 39. Even when having designated a DPO, then a very high percentage of organisations do not 
provide the DPOs with proper conditions for the fulfilment of their tasks, such as insufficient resources, 
lack of training, not ensuring the DPO’s independent position.

SE SA 

Swedish Supervisory Authority – Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection’s (IMY) 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Other tasks or roles in addition to the tasks of the DPO - when is there a risk of conflict of interest? 

1.  Main issue: The SE SA has noted that several DPO’s have other tasks/ roles outside of their role 
as  DPO  which  in  some  situations  potentially  could  result  in  a  conflict  of  interest  with  the 
assignment as DPO.  

2.  Provision: Article 38(6) GDPR. 
3.  Development of the issue: The responses show a wide variety of other roles/tasks assigned to 
the  DPO.  There  are  examples  of  operating  responsibilities,  follow-up  responsibilities, 
management  responsibilities  or  administrator  roles  etc.  within  several  different  areas  i.e. 
information security, compliance, administrative law and data protection.  

4.  Possible solutions: One solution could be to clarify the term ‘conflict of interests’ further than 
what  is  presented  in  the  guidelines  from  the  article  29  group  regarding  data  protections 
officers, e.g. through more examples of what other tasks are normally acceptable and not. It 
may  be  possible  to  make  this  assessment  easier  for  the  data  controller  by  developing  a 
checklist of questions that the data controller should ask about what the proposed other tasks 
involve in terms of decision-making etc. to make it easier to determine whether or not there 
may be a conflict of interest. 

2)  Differences  concerning  how  many  hours  of  training  the  DPO  have  in  order  to  develop  and/or 
maintain  their  professional  qualities  and  expert  knowledge  on  data  protection  law  and  practices 
annually 

1.  Main issue: The SE SA has noticed that there are differences concerning how many hours of 
training per year the DPO have to develop and/or maintain their qualifications and expertise 
in data protection law, which may pose a problem for some DPO’s in maintaining expertise. 

2.  Provision: Article 38(2) GDPR. 
3.  Development of the issue: The answers show a wide variation regarding how many hours of 
training the DPO have in order to develop and/or maintain their professional qualities and 
expert knowledge on data protection law and practices annually. Some estimate the range is 
between 5-10 hours per year and others to 150 hours per year. 

4.  Possible solutions: The responses indicate that data controllers need guidance on this issue. 
This specifically since the SE SA performed a survey during 2022 where the data protections 
officers expressed that they did not receive enough hours for further education. 

 

 

 

 

105 

3) Differences regarding the resources of the DPO 

1.  Main issue: The SE SA has noticed that there are differences regarding the amount of resources 
the DPO  have  in order  to  fulfill  their  tasks,  indicating  difficulties  in  assessing  the  required 
resources. 

2.  Provision: Article 38(2) GDPR. 
3.  Development of the issue: The responses show a great variety when it comes to how much 
resources are at hand to the data protection officers to perform their tasks. Some have stated 
that the DPO has 0-0.9 full time equivalents at their disposal while others have stated that the 
DPO has 6 full time equivalents or more and the rest has stated to lie within that range. The 
resources differ heavily despite that all organisations asked handle large amounts of personal 
data. Some have also stated that the allocated resources need to be reviewed. This can be 
compared to a survey made by the SE SA in 2022 where it was found that several DPOs stated 
that they do not have enough resources to perform their task. 

4.  Possible solution: It can possibly be concluded that it is difficult for data controllers to assess 
how  much  resource  the  DPO  needs  at  his/her  disposal  to  perform  the  task.  A  guidance 
document, as suggested in the next point 4, that further clarifies the tasks of the DPO would 
probably help data controllers to determine how much resources the DPO needs to fulfil its 
tasks.  

4) Different views on what should be included in the role of the DPO 

1.  Main issue: The SE SA has noticed that there are different views on what tasks are considered 

to be part of the DPO's role. 
2.  Provision: Article 39(1) GDPR. 
3.  Development of the issue: The answers show that the respondents to some part have different 
views  on  what  tasks  are  included  in  the  role  of  the  DPO.  For  example,  several  of  the 
organisations believe that the DPO should take part when managing a personal data breach, 
and only 2/3 of organisations believe that the DPO should take part in the planning of new 
procedures including processing of personal data.  

4.  Possible solution: The variation may be due to the fact that the data controller considers it 
difficult to determine what tasks should be included in the role of the DPO. The SE SA has 
received requests outside of this review of further guidelines regarding the role of the DPO 
including examples of what should be included and what should not be included as well as 
methodical support. Such guidelines would facilitate the work of the DPO while at the same 
time create a greater insight for the data controllers regarding the scope of the role.

SI SA 

Slovenian  Supervisory  Authority  –  Information  Commissioner  of  the  Republic  of  Slovenia 
(Informacijski pooblaščenec) 
 
Part I - Statistics  
 
Please see the consolidated figures in Appendix 1.1. The answers below may refer to the questions 
included in Appendix 1.1. 
 
Part II – Substantive issues 
 
1) Lack of consulting with the DPOs. 

Brief description: The survey showed a notable variance in how frequently DPOs are consulted within 
organizations.  Some  DPOs  are  consistently  involved  in  organizational  processes,  while  others  are 
consulted less than 5% of the time (181 out of 895 respondents). This suggests a possible gap in the 
recognition of the DPOs expertise and/or their integration within the organizational structure. 

Legal framework: This issue primarily concerns Articles 37 to 39 of the GDPR and Articles 44, 45 and 
48 of the Slovenian Data Protection Act (ZVOP-2), where both outline the designation, position, and 
tasks of a DPO. The provisions emphasize the necessity for DPOs to be involved in all issues relating to 
the protection of personal data, which implicitly necessitates their consultation. 

GDPR: 

•  Article 37 specifies the conditions under which the designation of a DPO is mandatory. It lays 
out that public authorities and bodies shall designate a DPO, as well as organizations that carry 
out large-scale processing of special categories of data. 

•  Article 38 emphasizes the DPOs accessibility within the organization. It states that the DPO 
‘shall be involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection 
of personal data.’ The article also calls for the DPO to be provided with the necessary resources 
to carry out their tasks and maintain their expert knowledge. 

•  Article  39  lists  the  tasks  of  the  DPO,  which  are  essentially  advisory,  supervisory,  and 
cooperative in nature. The DPO serves as the point of contact for the supervisory authority 
and also plays a role in awareness-raising and training of staff. 

 

 

 

 

Slovenia's national Data Protection Act (ZVOP-2): 

•  Article 44 complements Article 39 of the GDPR, specifying that the DPOs advisory role aims to 
ensure compliance with not only the GDPR but also the national laws, enriching the scope and 
responsibilities of the DPO. 

•  Article 45 aligns with GDPR's Article 37 by providing details on who needs to designate a DPO. 
It adds a national layer to the obligation, such as the eight-day timeframe for publicizing the 
DPOs  contact  information  and  sending  a  notice  of  their  designation  to  the  supevisory 
authority. 

•  Article  48  delves  into  the  operational  aspects  of  the  DPOs  role.  It  talks  about  the  DPOs 
responsibility to conduct risk assessments concerning data security. This independent duty 
harmonizes with the GDPR’s Article 39, amplifying the importance of involving the DPO in 
pertinent activities on data protection. 

108 

 

 

Issues: The issue of inconsistent consultations with the DPOs, as revealed in the survey, could prove 
to have implications for compliance at multiple levels. It could contradict the aim of both GDPR and 
ZVOP-2, which both regulate the DPOs role as an integral part of the data protection framework, 
envisaging their proactive involvement in all relevant  data protection  issues at the controller. The 
survey  results  (in  some  segments  of  respondents)  indicate  a  minimal  involvement  of  the  DPOs  in 
organizational  processes  therefore  exposing  a  systemic  gap  in  the  practical  application  of  the 
regulations. The results are consistent with results from our own survey from 2019, showing late or 
incomplete inclusion of DPOs in data processing decision-making. Given these provisions, the lack of 
consultations with the DPOs not only indicates a deviation from best practices but potentially a direct 
contravention of GDPR’s requirements, particularly those set in Article 38 GDPR concerning the timely 
and proper involvement of the DPO in (all) data protection issues. 
 
This gap could lead to a failure in achieving the fundamental goals of data protection, thereby exposing 
the organization to legal risks such as non-compliance fines, enforcement actions, and reputational 
damages. In the absence of regular and meaningful consultation with DPOs, there is an elevated risk 
that data protection impact assessments may be inadequately performed, staff could be poorly trained 
in data protection issues, and data breaches may not be managed effectively. This inconsistency also 
compromises  the  DPOs  ability  to  serve  as  a  liaison  between  the  controller  and  the  supervisory 
authority, thereby weakening the overall data protection ecosystem. 
 
Differences: Some organizations seem to integrate DPOs thoroughly into all relevant data processing 
activities, while others only engage them in specific circumstances. This split indicates that there is no 
uniform approach to leveraging the expertise of DPOs, which could potentially affect the efficacy of 
data protection measures in these organizations. 
 
Additionally, the data show that while most organizations appear to be attentive to the advice given 
by their DPOs, there is a significant discrepancy when it comes to documenting instances where this 
advice isn't followed. This lack of documentation could undermine accountability and transparency in 
data protection practices. Moreover, the responses about how often DPOs are provided sufficient 
information to perform their duties reveal that access to necessary information is not consistent across 
organizations. This could impact the ability of DPOs to carry out their roles effectively, thereby affecting 
the overall compliance of the organization. 
 
Solutions: One viable solution to improve the integration of DPOs in organizational processes is to 
establish a mandatory consultation mechanism. Alongside this, it could be beneficial to institute a 
formal  process  for  documenting  instances  when  the  DPO’s  advice  is  not  followed.  By  doing  so, 
organizations can maintain a transparent record, providing accountability and facilitating any future 
audits or inspections in this matter. By revising internal protocols to ensure that DPOs are involved at 
key stages of any data processing activities, their role would be better institutionalized. Instituting 
mandatory checkpoints could then bridge the gap between organizations where DPOs are already 
actively involved and those where they are consulted less frequently. 
 
Another approach to ensure a more active role of DPOs could be to invest in regular training and 
awareness-raising campaigns for both the DPOs and other key personnel within the organizations. The 
consultation and its documentation requirements could be emphasized in these training sessions. For 
DPOs to be truly effective, it is crucial that their peers and superiors also understand the importance 
and legal imperatives of data protection. This educational initiative could serve as a forum for clarifying 
the circumstances under which the DPO should be consulted and how their recommendations should 
be  documented,  thereby  fostering  a  culture  of  data  protection  compliance  throughout  the  whole 
organization. 

109 

 

 
Data controllers are regularly reminded by the supervisory authority in their opinions on received 
DPIAs to consult DPOs when conducting DPIs and document their involvement. 
 
2) Lack of resources (time & expert knowledge) of the DPOs. 
 
Brief  description:  There  seems  to  be  a  clear  desire  by  respondents  for  additional  guidance  and 
resources on data protection issues, such as templates for various documents and more practical, 
issue-specific advice from the SA. This suggests that DPOs may be under-resourced in terms of both (i) 
time that they can allocate to exercise the role as the DPO and (ii) expert knowledge needed to perform 
the role, making it challenging for them to execute their tasks effectively. 
 
Legal framework: Article 38(2) of the GDPR explicitly stipulates that the controller and processor ‘shall 
support  the  data  protection  officer  in  performing  the  tasks  referred  to  in  Article  39  by  providing 
resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, 
and to maintain his or her expert knowledge.’ Meanwhile, the first paragraph of Article 46 of ZVOP-2 
states that one of the qualifications for a DPO is the ‘possession of knowledge or practical experience 
in the field of data protection’. Both legal frameworks are thus not merely suggestive but explicit about 
the essential resources and qualifications needed for DPOs to execute their roles effectively. 
 
Issues: The issue of DPOs being under-resourced presents a significant challenge for organizations in 
fulfilling their data protection obligations. Based on the survey, respondents expressed a desire for 
additional  resources  like  templates  and  issue-specific  advice  from  supervisory  authorities.  This 
suggests that DPOs are often stretched thin, lacking both the time and the specialized knowledge 
required to perform their duties effectively. This resonates with the legal stipulations in both GDPR 
and  ZVOP-2,  which  explicitly  mention  the  necessity  of  providing  adequate  resources  for  DPOs  to 
maintain their expert knowledge and perform their roles while also echoing the results of our national 
survey done in 2019. 
 
Under-resourcing not only undermines the effectiveness of DPOs but also poses a risk for organizations 
in terms of compliance. When DPOs are under-resourced, there is a higher likelihood of lapses in data 
protection  measures,  which  could  potentially  result  in  legal  ramifications  for  the  organizations 
involved. Therefore, the lack of adequate resources is not just an internal organizational issue but one 
that has broader compliance and legal implications. 
 
A particular issue also arises when an external DPO is tasked with serving a large number of clients, 
posing challenges both in resource allocation and specialized expertise. The extensive client list raises 
concerns about the DPO's ability to adequately manage the diverse and complex data protection needs 
of  each  organization.  This  dilution  of  focus  can  compromise  the  effectiveness  and  compliance  of 
various data protection programs under the DPO's supervision. Furthermore, the GDPR mandates that 
DPOs be involved in all issues related to the protection of personal data, necessitating an in-depth 
understanding  of  each  client's  specific  internal  processes,  data  flows,  and  their  concrete  data 
protection  risks.  Given  these  requirements,  an  external  DPO  responsible  for  multiple  clients  may 
struggle  to  maintain  the  specialized  expertise  required  for  each  client's  unique  data  protection 
landscape, which can lead to the DPO being inadequately informed and less effective. 
 
Differences:  The  survey  results  show several  differences  and  inconsistencies  among  DPOs  in  their 
experience and resources. For example, most DPOs have experience in data protection and privacy 
(803 out of 895), but far fewer are skilled in information systems management or development (113 
out of 895). This suggests an uneven spread of skills that could impact how well data protection is 

110 

 

carried out. Likewise, while most respondents view expert knowledge of data protection rules and 
GDPR tasks as essential (742 and 726 respectively), a notable number (56 respondents) report that 
they were designated as DPOs simply because it was required, not because they had specific expertise. 
When it comes to time allocation, only a small number (40 respondents) can devote 91-100% of their 
working hours to DPO tasks, and 146 can give less than 5% of their time. Among the 895 respondents, 
approximately 34.2% of DPOs (306 out of 895) stated that they receive 8 or fewer allocated hours per 
year for professional development in data protection law and practices. Notably, within this group, 
121 DPOs reported having zero allocated hours, indicating a concerning lack of resources for enhancing 
their expertise in data protection. In contrast, 228 DPOs (approximately 25.5%) reported having more 
than 32 hours allocated annually for such development. This significant variance in allocated hours for 
professional development underscores the need for more consistent and substantial opportunities for 
DPOs to enhance their expertise in data protection matters, while the differences point to a challenging 
situation where DPOs may not have the support or resources they need to do their jobs effectively. 
 
Solutions:  One  potential  solution  to  address  the  lack  of  resources  for  DPOs  is  for  supervisory 
authorities to provide a more comprehensive set of guidelines, tools, and training materials, tailored 
to the specific needs identified in the surveys. For instance, 100 respondents expressed a desire for 
Q&As/FAQs, while 73 indicated that they would benefit from specialized training materials. These 
resources could help DPOs navigate complex issues and save time, thus allowing them to focus on 
critical aspects of data protection. Adding to this, supervisory authorities could create a user-friendly, 
transparent,  centralized  online  database  of  their  opinions  and  decisions,  similar  to  the  existing 
databases from the Slovenian SA67 and the EDPB68. Such a database would serve as an invaluable 
resource for enhancing the DPO’s expert knowledge. 
 
It is also important to raise awareness among the management that there are clear obligations for 
them to provide adequate resources and training for their DPOs. Given that the SA was unable to issue 
fines until January 2023 this may have resulted in data controllers neglecting their DPO obligations 
therefore increased enforcement by the SA could improve management’s attitudes towards providing 
sufficient resources for DPOs thus also respecting their legal obligations  
 
Another viable solution is for organizations themselves to reassess and realign the resources allocated 
to the DPO role, as mandated by paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the GDPR. Providing DPOs with adequate 
time, staffing, and budget can ensure that they effectively carry out their tasks. Organizations can 
develop a system to document instances where the advice of DPOs is not followed, thus highlighting 
areas where additional resources or training may be required. This would not only empower DPOs but 
also foster a data protection culture within the organization, contributing to GDPR compliance.  
 
Regarding the challenges of external DPOs not being able to be fully informed and focused to the 
individual  controller’s  data  protection  needs,  all  organizations  employing  external  DPOs  should 
exercise  due  diligence  in  evaluating  whether  their  DPO  has  both  the  resources  and  expertise  to 
effectively manage their specific data protection needs. 
 

3) Independence of the DPOs. 
Brief description: There appears to be a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the DPO's role 
as  an  independent  advisor.  A  segment  of  respondents  indicated  that  their  organizations  give

instructions to the DPOs, which could compromise the independence essential for the role of the DPO. 
Also,  only  255  out  of  316  DPOs  who  have  an  allocated  budget,  manage  it  independently,  raising 
questions about the DPO's operational independence. 
 
Legal framework: Under the GDPR, the independence of the DPO is specifically highlighted in Article 
38, paragraph 3, which states that the DPO should not receive any instructions regarding the exercise 
of their tasks and should report directly to the highest management level. 
 
Separately, in Slovenia's ZVOP-2, the independence of the DPO is outlined in the first paragraph of 
Article  48.  This  provision  stipulates  that  the  DPO  performs  its  tasks  in  an  independent  manner, 
particularly when advising on risk assessments related to data security for all processing activities 
carried out by the controller or processor. 
 
Issues: One significant concern that arises when a DPO lacks independence is the erosion of regulatory 
compliance and internal oversight mechanisms. Without the freedom to act impartially, a DPO may be 
inclined to prioritize organizational goals over regulatory obligations, which in turn, can compromise 
the effectiveness of performed DPIAs, data protection rights requests, and internal audits on data 
protection issues at the controller. The result could be overlooked vulnerabilities, gaps in compliance, 
and ultimately, a heightened risk of personal data violations. A compromised DPO undermines the 
entire  foundation  of  data  protection  within  the  organization,  opening  the  door  to  scrutiny  and 
increased regulatory action. 
 
Another issue pertains to the integrity of communications about data protection to both internal and 
external stakeholders. A DPO without independence might be pressured to present the state of data 
protection within the organization in an overly favorable light. This can create a distorted picture that 
misleads the management, the workforce, and external partners. Such misrepresentation not only 
jeopardizes compliance but also poses substantial reputational risks. In the event of a data breach or 
audit,  stakeholders  will  question  the  reliability  of  past  and  future  communications  from  the DPO, 
leading to a loss of trust that can have long-lasting repercussions. 
 
Another  issue  that  arises also  seems to  be  related to the operational  independence of  the  DPOs, 
particularly when a DPO lacks control over its own budget. Without this financial autonomy, the DPO's 
ability to prioritize critical activities, such as specialized training, is significantly hindered. This can lead 
to insufficient or delayed responses to urgent data protection issues, thereby undermining compliance 
efforts. When a DPO lacks control over its budget, managed instead by the organization, the lack of 
financial  autonomy  could  make  the  DPO  hesitant  to  critique  the  organization's  data  protection 
practices, fearing budget cuts or resource limitations as a form of ‘retaliation’. 
 
Differences:  The  survey  results  highlight  two  distinct  aspects of  DPOs  independence  that  warrant 
attention. First, although 635 respondents believe they have sufficient resources to fulfill their roles, 
only 316 report having an allocated budget, while only 255 manage it independently. This discrepancy 
suggests that the operational independence of numerous DPOs could be compromised.  
 
Second,  the  survey  shows  that  58  respondents  indicated  their  organizations  give  instructions 
concerning the DPO's tasks and duties. Given the DPO's role as an independent advisor, such directives 
could undermine the integrity of the DPO function and thus, data protection compliance. Further, 
while the survey shows that only one DPO has been dismissed or penalized for performing their duties, 
the fact that it has occurred at all could have a chilling effect, hindering DPOs from executing their 
roles with full independence. 
 

112 

 

 

Solutions: One effective measure to enhance the independence of the DPO could be for supervisory 
authorities to develop clear and stringent guidelines on DPO’s independence, beyond what is already 
articulated  in  GDPR  and  national  laws  like  ZVOP-2.  These  could  detail  the  impermissibility  of 
organizational  interference  in  the  DPO’s  tasks,  specifically  outlining  the  autonomy  over  budget 
management. An additional measure could be requiring DPOs to complete an annual declaration of 
conflicts of interest, similar to what is often required for board members and executives. This can help 
in the early identification of potential issues that may compromise a DPO's independence. 
 
Moreover, organizations themselves can take proactive steps to safeguard the independence of their 
DPOs. For instance, mandatory, periodic training sessions can be conducted to educate executives and 
decision-makers  about  the  critical  importance  of  DPO’s  independence.  Internal  policies  could  be 
introduced, ensuring that DPOs are not given other roles that could create a conflict of interest, as 
indicated  by  the  survey  where  DPOs  also  serve  in  multiple  roles,  such  as  in  high  management 
capacities. Another constructive solution could be the establishment of a performance review process 
for  DPOs  carried  out  by  an  external,  independent  body,  thereby  eliminating  internal  biases  and 
promoting accountability.  
 
4) Inconsistency in compliance reporting. 

Brief description: The issue highlights a lack of uniformity in the DPOs reporting mechanisms for data 
protection  activities  and  compliance  measures  to  the  top  management.  Such  inconsistencies  can 
compromise the DPO's efficacy, risking the oversight of critical data protection issues and thereby 
influencing the organization's overall compliance. 

Legal framework: The reporting obligations of DPOs are explicitly stated in Article 38(3) of the GDPR, 
which mandates that the ‘data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level 
of the controller or the processor.’ 
 
Issues: The issue of infrequent or irregular reporting by DPOs to the highest management level raises 
significant concerns about effective oversight and governance. While GDPR’s Article 38(3) stipulates 
that the DPO should report directly to the highest management level, it does not specify the frequency 
of these reports or their format, be it oral or written. This lack of concretization can lead to inconsistent 
practices  across  organizations.  A  written  report,  for  instance,  offers  greater  accountability  and 
traceability  than  an  oral  briefing,  thereby  serving  as  a  stronger  instrument  for  data  protection 
compliance. 
 
Moreover, the absence of guidelines on what the reports should include leaves room for discrepancy 
in  the  comprehensiveness  and  usefulness  of  these  communications.  Ideally,  these  reports  should 
provide  an  unambiguous  overview  of  the  organization's  data  protection  posture,  including  risk 
assessments, potential violations, and recommendations for improvements.  
 
Differences:  The  survey  results  reveal  notable  differences  in  the  frequency  and  method  of  DPO’s 
reporting to the highest management level. While a majority of 568 respondents indicated that their 
DPO reports 1–2 times a year, 144 respondents stated that no reporting is expected at all. Additionally, 
the methods of reporting also vary considerably: 385 instances involved a written report submitted to 
the board, 68 were submitted to other management groups, and 394 were mostly oral reports. This 
lack of uniformity in the reporting format—whether written or oral—further complicates matters, as 
written reports usually offer better traceability and accountability. 
 

 

113 

Solutions:  To  address  the  inconsistency  in  reporting  frequency,  organizations  should  establish  a 
standardized  reporting  schedule  that  aligns  with  both  operational  needs  and  compliance 
requirements.  This  schedule  should  be  formalized  in  the  organization's  data  protection  policy  or 
governance framework to ensure regularity and accountability. Such a step would ensure that DPOs 
are aligned with management expectations and are regularly auditing, updating, and informing the 
highest management level about the organization's data protection posture. 
 
As  for  the  reporting  format,  a  hybrid  approach  could  be  beneficial.  DPOs  should  provide  written 
reports for formal board meetings to ensure traceability and support accountability. These reports 
should  comprehensively  outline  compliance  status,  risk  assessments,  and  any  data  breaches  or 
complaints received. For more frequent updates or less formal settings, oral reports or presentations 
can be considered sufficient. By employing both written and oral methods, organizations can maintain 
flexibility while upholding accountability standards. 
 
Supervisory  authority  has  issued  DPO  recommendations  for  organizations  that  cover  also  the 
relationship and reporting to the management69. 
 
5) Accountability and Responsibility of External DPOs. 

Brief description: This issue pertains to the complexities arising when an external DPO serves and acts 
as a DPO for multiple controllers. Questions arise concerning who bears ultimate responsibility for data 
protection violations, and how a controller ensures that the external DPO is adequately monitoring 
compliance  and  focusing  on  them  as  a  client.  This  situation  can  create  ambiguities  around 
accountability and potentially dilute the effectiveness of the DPO’s role. 

Legal framework: GDPR mandates the appointment of DPOs under Article 37, while delineating the 
tasks and responsibilities of a DPO in Article 39. However, the GDPR does not explicitly address the 
issue of responsibility when an external DPO serves multiple organizations, leaving a gap in the legal 
framework concerning accountability and the division of responsibilities between the controller and 
an externally appointed DPO. 
 
In the context of Slovenia, ZVOP-2 provides additional clarity on the issue of external DPOs serving 
multiple organizations. Specifically, Article 47 of ZVOP-2 allows multiple controllers or processors to 
appoint a single, shared DPO, given considerations of their organizational structure, size, or diversity 
of  data  processing  activities.  The  same  article  also  contains  provisions  for  special  categories  of 
organizations, like law firms, notaries, and trade unions, to appoint a shared DPO in consultation with 
their respective professional bodies. 
 
Issues: One significant issue with external DPOs serving multiple organizations lies in the distribution 
of  responsibility  and  accountability  for  data  protection  violations.  Given  that  these  DPOs  oversee 
multiple  organizations,  there  is  a  risk  that  their  attention  could  be  divided  and  level  of  provided 
services  inadequate,  potentially  leading  to  lapses  in  compliance  or  oversight.  In  turn,  this  raises 
questions about who bears the responsibility in case of data protection breaches—whether it's solely 
the  controller  or  (also)  the  external  DPO  (also  in  terms  of  civil  liability  between  them).  This  is 
particularly  relevant  when  the  DPO's  role  includes  providing  advice,  monitoring  compliance,  and 
liaising with supervisory authorities, among other responsibilities.

Given that the SA was unable to issue fines until January 2023 this may have resulted in data controllers 
neglecting  their  DPO  obligations.  This  is  also  particularly  relevant  where  the  management  has 
appointed  an  external  DPO  merely  to  fulfill  their  legal  obligations,  but  in  practice  do  not  require 
external DPOs to perform their duties properly. The latter appears to be especially the case in smaller 
organizations in the public sector (mandated by the GDPR to nominate a DPO) that lack appropriate 
in-house data protection personnel and resort to external DPOs that however lack stimulus to provide 
DPOs services comprehensively and proactively. Feedback from the field shows that some external 
DPOs cater hundred plus clients (often small organizations required to nominate DPOs by law), provide 
only a basic-level service to their clients, which on the other hand also do not ask them to provide 
service levels that would be appropriate. Of concern in such situations could also be potential conflict 
of interest where external DPOs not only provide DPO-related services to their clients (e.g., awareness 
raising, monitoring compliance), but also act as advisors providing other data protection services (e.g., 
drafting contracts, records of data processing, consent forms etc.). 
 
Another  concern  is  the  mechanism  for  performance  assessment  and  quality  control.  There  are 
challenges in establishing standardized protocols to evaluate how well the external DPO is managing 
data  protection  compliance  across  the  organization.  There  is  also  the  question  of  how  these 
organizations ensure that the DPO is effectively focused on them as clients and is not prioritizing one 
organization  over  another.  Both  the  DPO  and  the  controllers  need  to  have  transparent  lines  of 
communication and clear expectations to manage these challenges effectively. Additional issues could 
stem from managing sensitive information across multiple organizations, which increases the risk of 
confidentiality breaches while also facing a challenge to ensure that the DPO is adequately trained and 
updated  on  the  specific  needs  and  nuances  of each  organization  they  serve, which  seems  like  an 
immense operational challenge. 
 
Differences:  The  survey  findings  reveal  a  wide  spectrum  of  roles  that  DPOs  occupy  within 
organizations. While 379 DPOs of the 895 participants in the survey primarily serve as internal staff 
members, 135 extend their responsibilities to cover multiple authorities or a group of undertakings. 
Appointment durations for DPOs also vary considerably, with the most common term being one to 
three  years,  often  with  the  possibility  of  extension.  This  flexibility  in  appointment  terms  raises 
questions about the continuity of data protection efforts, as longer-term appointments can foster 
institutional knowledge and in-depth expertise, while shorter terms may introduce fresh perspectives 
but disrupt ongoing initiatives. These variations emphasize the importance of tailoring DPO roles and 
appointments to suit the specific needs and structures of each organization. 
 
Solutions: Addressing the issue of accountability and responsibility for external DPOs necessitates a 
multi-faced  approach.  First,  organizations  employing  external  DPOs  should  establish  robust 
contractual  agreements  that  clearly  outline  the  DPO's  roles,  responsibilities,  and  reporting 
mechanisms. These contracts should specify the scope of their duties, communication protocols, and 
compliance  expectations.  Additionally,  they  should  include  provisions  for  regular  performance 
assessments and feedback mechanisms to ensure that the DPOs remain aligned with the organization's 
data protection objectives. 
 
Secondly,  we  as  supervisory  authorities  can  play  a  pivotal  role  by  providing  guidelines  and 
recommendations  for  organizations  employing  external  DPOs.  These  guidelines  could  offer  best 
practices  for  DPOs  designations,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  independence,  expertise,  and 
allocated resources. Supervisory authorities could also facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration 
among  external  DPOs  through  industry-specific  forums/networks/trainings,  enabling  them  to  stay 
updated on evolving data protection issues and regulatory challenges.  
 

115 

 

Thirdly, implementing regular internal audits/inspections of external DPOs also seems as a proactive 
approach  to  ensure  accountability  and  adherence  to  data  protection  regulations.  These 
audits/inspections should be conducted both by the organizations employing external DPOs and by 
supervisory authorities. They could serve as a means to assess the DPO's performance, independence, 
and  compliance  with  contractual  obligations.  By  subjecting  external  DPOs  to  periodic  scrutiny, 
organizations can maintain confidence in their data protection practices and swiftly address any issues 
that may arise, ultimately raising the effectiveness of data protection measures. 
 
Lastly, increased enforcement by the supervisory authority, including when necessary, resulting in 
fines, could improve management’s attitudes towards providing sufficient resources for DPOs thus also 
respecting their legal obligations. 
 
Transparency  also  seems  as  a  key  element  to  ensure  that  external  DPOs  remain  accountable. 
Legislators should foresee a need of implementing higher transparency obligations for external DPOs, 
to  require  them  to  provide  transparent  reports  on  their  activities,  including  the  number  of 
organizations they serve, the types of issues they handle, and the outcomes of their interventions. This 
in respect could enhance visibility into their work and ensure better accountability. 
 
Part III – Actions by the SA 
 
1.  Have  you  already  published  general  guidance  (e.g.  guides,  guidelines,  etc.)  regarding  DPOs 

(including before launching the coordinated action)?  
If yes, please provide the date, link to the guidance, and a short description of the guidelines 

 
We refer to Working Party Article 29/EDPB Guidelines on DPOs. However, we have a dedicate sub-site 
with information on DPOs70 and have published a report based on our survey among DPOs in the public 
sector conducted in 2019 that covered similar issues as this survey. The report was released on January 
28, 2020, and is accessible via the following link: DPO Survey 2020 Report71. 
 
We have also issued recommendation and best practices for organizations with DPOs72. 

2.  Have  you  taken  action  (i.e.,  fact  finding  exercises,  informal  contact,  prior  consultation, 
investigation) towards any of the organisations concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of 
the DPO prior to launching the coordinated action? Please describe the action you have taken 
and  the  outcome  of  this  action  (e.g.  letter,  recommendations  to  the  organisation,  general 
guidance,  corrective  measures  such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental 
penalty, administrative fines).  

 
In late 2019 we have conducted a survey among DPOs in the public sector in order to establish what is 
the situation regarding their designation, position and tasks in practice. We also wanted to find out 
the perceived obstacles and key success factors according to the opinion of DPOs themselves to fulfil 
their goals successfully. We have received 100 replies (responding was not mandatory). The results 
were then analysed and presented on the occasion of European Data Protection Day 2020.

The results of the survey indicated that there were no substantial problems arising from the lack of 
management support, however in general DPOs reported not having enough time to fulfil their tasks 
and responsibilities to assure compliance with data protection legislation. DPOs reported, that the 
most important key success factors are: management support (4.64 out of 5), management’s trust 
(4.61), timely inclusion of the DPOs in decision-making processes (4.54) and sufficient training and 
education for DPOs to maintain their knowledge and expertise (4.52). 
 
We have also carried out two waves of privacy sweeps in 2022 in the public sector aimed towards 
organisations that have not yet designated a DPO. We discovered roughly 520 public bodies that have 
not yet informed us of their DPO’s designation to our SA (but are in the public sector register) and 
contacted  them  via  e-mail  encouraging  them  to  fulfil  their  DPO  designation  and  information 
obligations using the web form at our website within a one-month deadline. In the privacy sweep 
conducted, we have also included a link to all information about the designation, position and tasks of 
DPOs including DPO’s guidelines and DPO’s recommendations that we had posted on our website. 
Within first two weeks we had received 150 new notices on the DPOs designation; 226 in the first 
round and around 400 new notices in both rounds of privacy sweep73. All in all, the sweep was very 
successful. The results guided primarily our awareness raising activities and insofar, given that our 
national  data  protection  law  was  adopted  in  January  2023,  have  not  resulted  in  enforcement  or 
sanctioning procedures. 
 
3.  What action(s) are you planning to undertake based on the results of this coordinated action, if 
any? (e.g. letter, recommendations to the organisation, general guidance, corrective measures 
such  as  orders,  injunctions  with  or  without  an  incremental  penalty,  administrative  fines).  If 
possible, please indicate the timeline for these actions (also in case formal investigations are still 
ongoing)  

 
The results of the 2023 CEF will be used in our awareness raising and enforcement strategies, most 
likely  resulting  in  increased  co-operation  between  the  supervisory  authority  and  respective  DPOs 
organisations in particular sectors (e.g., in education, health and other sectors). DPO networking also 
seems as an important platform to share knowledge and best practices among DPOs and where the 
supervisory authority can play an important role in empowering DPOs, while assisting them in forming 
networks and alliances. Responses from DPOs will therefore guide our awareness raising and training 
activities - we will continue providing guidance materials (mostly guidelines, opinions and infographics 
which had received very positive responses from the DPOs) and try to publish them in form(at) that is 
most  usable  for  DPOs  to  carry  out  their  data  protection  training  and  awareness  raising  in  their 
organisations. 
 
Dedicated  and  targeted  enforcement  actions  are  not  foreseen  as  this  was  a  ‘fact  finding  and 
determining  follow-up  action  based  on  the  results’  type  action.  However,  given  the  fact  that  our 
national data protection law was adopted in 2023, which (finally) allows us to issue fines regarding the 
DPO-related obligations of data controllers/processors, the results of the action will be taken into 
account in our future enforcement activities. Several DPO related issues be a direct consequence of 
the (legal) inability of the supervisory authority to issue fines, resulting in data controllers neglecting 
their DPO-related obligations.  
 

                                                           
73 As the time from the privacy sweep passes on by, it is hard to determine whether a concrete new notice of 
designation of the DPO is a direct result of conducting the sweep or not. 

117 

 

Part IV – Other 
 
1.  What is your general impression of the levels of awareness and compliance of the organisations 

you consulted concerning the designation, tasks and/or role of the DPO?  

 
Based  on  survey  results,  there  is  a  keen  interest  in  compliance  with  data  protection  obligations, 
particularly regarding the roles and responsibilities of DPOs. Controllers are generally keen to align 
their  operations  with  data  protection  regulations  but  often  find  themselves  in  need  of  additional 
guidance, especially when encountering challenges that existing SA guidance (opinions, guidelines…) 
don't  cover  comprehensively  and  specific  to  the  concrete  data  processing.  It  may  be  observed  in 
general that particularly smaller organizations have lower awareness and resources in terms of DPOs. 
Often, they resort to external DPOs for their services, which are however only basic-level both from 
the aspect of the organizations in terms of their demands and form the aspect of providers. Lack of 
enforcement and fines has undoubtedly had a negative impact on the level of compliance.  
 
The survey reveals inconsistent DPO involvement in data protection activities within organizations, 
contributing  to  uncertainty  for  controllers.  While  some  organizations  consult  their  DPO  almost 
continuously (129 respondents), a noteworthy number involve their DPO less than 5% of the time (181 
respondents).  This variability  not only  signals  a  need  for  further  guidance on this  matter  but  also 
highlights that a more structured form of interaction between controllers and DPOs may be beneficial. 
Significantly, 100 respondents called for Q&As or FAQs from the SA and 126 for DPOs and internal 
employees  training  materials.  This  high  demand  for  additional  guidance  suggests  that  practical, 
scenario-based  advice  from  the  SA  would  be  particularly  beneficial  in  enhancing  both  compliance 
levels and confidence among controllers. 
 
A concerning aspect seems to be varying degree to which advice from DPOs is acted upon. While a 
considerable number of respondents (476) indicated that the DPOs advice is generally well-followed, 
there remains a segment where advice of the DPOs might not always be followed. The absence of 
documented reasons for this non-compliance seems as a point of concern. 
 
Additionally,  there  is  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  clarity  regarding  the  DPOs  role  within  organizations. 
Specifically, 58 respondents stated that their organization instructs the DPO in the execution of tasks, 
indicating a potential misunderstanding of the DPOs role as an independent advisor rather than an 
extension of the management. Further adding complexity is the inconsistent frequency with which 
DPOs  report  to  the  highest  level  of  management,  revealing  varying  perceptions  of  the  DPO's 
importance within different organizations. 
 
In summary, while there seems to be a base level of awareness and an aspiration for compliance, gaps 
in understanding both the role of the DPO and SA are evident. These gaps are pronounced in areas 
such as the inconsistent involvement of DPOs in data protection activities, the extent to which their 
advice  is  disregarded,  misunderstandings  about  their  role  as  independent  advisors  and  the 
misunderstanding of the SA’s role, whereas our tasks are to supervise compliance and not be individual 
consultants in concrete matters. 
 
2.  Are there any other issues or topics that you would like to flag? 

We would like to flag several key issues based on the responses received in the survey. First and 
foremost, a recurring theme is the lack of specialized training and expertise of DPOs in the area of data 
protection. Respondents consistently mention that they face resource constraints both in terms of 
time and human capacity. 

 

118 

 

 

 

 

share? 

In light of this, it is apparent that there is a strong desire among respondents to fulfil their obligations 
under  data  protection  laws;  however,  they  often  find  themselves  in  need  of  additional  support. 
Specifically,  they  are  looking  for  expert  knowledge,  more  comprehensive  guidance,  document 
templates, and tailored assistance for confronting practical challenges they encounter. According to 
the survey, a large number of respondents indicated the need for further guidance in the form of 
Q&As/FAQs. This could be indicative of a broader need for easily accessible information that can be 
referred to in real-time as challenges arise.  

In summary, there is an evident need for more targeted resources and guidance to help organizations 
(and the DPOs) meet their data protection responsibilities effectively. 

3.  Are there any leading practices of the organisations you have contacted that you would like to 

 
No specific practices were identified that exceed the existing legal obligations concerning the role and 
tasks of DPOs within organizations.
