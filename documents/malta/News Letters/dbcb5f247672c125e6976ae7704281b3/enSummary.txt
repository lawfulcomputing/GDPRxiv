EDPB adopts the second Coordinated Enforcement Framework report on the Designation and Position of Data Protection Officers
 
In October 2020, the EDPB decided to set up a Coordinated Enforcement Framework (‘CEF’) as a key action under the second pillar of its 2021-2023 Strategy.  The aim of this action is to aim at streamlining enforcement and cooperation among supervisory authorities.
In September 2022, the EDPB selected the topic of the designation and position of DPOs for its 2023 Coordinated Enforcement Framework. The report lists, inter alia, the obstacles currently faced by DPOs, along with a series of recommendations to further strengthen their role.
Our Office was one of the 25 members which participated in this coordinated action.
