the adoption of the adequacy decision on 10 July 2023 

 
On 10 July 2023, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) adopted its Implementing Decision of 
10.7.2023 pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on 
the  adequate  level  of  protection  of  personal  data  under  the  EU-US  Data  Privacy  Framework (‘the 
Adequacy Decision’)1, which contains in its annex the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (‘DPF’). 
 
By doing so, the Commission decided that the United States (‘the US’), for the purpose of Article 45 of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘the GDPR’), ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data 
transferred from the EU2 to organisations in the US that are included in the ‘Data Privacy Framework 
List’, maintained and  made  publicly  available  by  the  U.S. Department  of  Commerce,  in  accordance 
with Section I.3 of Annex I of the Adequacy Decision3. 
 
Prior to the adoption of this decision, the European Data Protection Board (‘the EDPB’) adopted its 
opinion on the draft Adequacy Decision4, in compliance with Article 70(1)(s) GDPR.  
 
This document aims at providing some clarity on the implications of the Adequacy Decision for data 
subjects in the EU and for entities transferring personal data from the EU to the US. 
 
1.- How can personal data be transferred to the US on the basis of the DPF?  
  
The Adequacy Decision applies since 10 July 2023. This means that, as of this date, transfers from the 
EU5 to organisations in the US that are included in the ‘Data Privacy Framework List’6 may be based 
on the Adequacy Decision, without the need to rely on Article 46 GDPR transfer tools.  

 

1  Commission  Implementing  Decision  of  10.7.2023  pursuant  to  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council on the adequate level of protection of personal data under the EU-US Data Privacy 
Framework, C(2023) 4745 final.

5  This  means  that  the  Adequacy  Decision  does  not  cover  transfers  from  entities  located  outside  the  EU  and 
subject to the GDPR by virtue of Article 3(2) GDPR to organisations in the US that are included in the ‘Data Privacy 
Framework List’.

This also means that transfers based on the Adequacy Decision do not have to be complemented by 
supplementary  measures7.  The  EDPB  refers  to  the  explanations  provided  on  this  matter  by  the 
Commission8.  
 
2.- How can personal data be transferred to the US if the data importer is not included in the ‘Data 
Privacy Framework List’?  
 
Transfers to entities in the US which are not included in the ‘Data Privacy Framework List’ cannot  be 
based on the Adequacy Decision and will require appropriate data protection safeguards, enforceable 
rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects (e.g. through standard data protection clauses, 
binding corporate rules), in accordance with Article 46 GDPR9.  
 
In  this  respect,  the  EDPB underlines  that  all  the  safeguards  that  have  been  put  in  place  by  the  US 
Government  in  the  area  of  national  security  (including  the  redress  mechanism)  apply  to  all  data 
transferred  to  the  US,  regardless  of  the  transfer  tool  used10.  Therefore,  when  assessing  the 
effectiveness of the Article 46 GDPR transfer tool chosen11,  data exporters should take into account 
the assessment conducted by the Commission in the Adequacy Decision12. 
 
3.- Can data subjects in the EU lodge complaints under the DPF? 
 
Individuals whose data are transferred to the US based on the Adequacy Decision have several redress 
mechanisms at their disposal  if they consider that the  US organisation concerned does not comply 
with the DPF13. Individuals are encouraged to first raise any complaint they may have with the relevant 
US organisation. In case of inquiries, EU organisations may, if necessary, seek the advice of their data 
protection authorities that are competent to oversee the related processing activities. 
 
4.  How  can  EU  data  subjects  make  use  of  the  new  redress  mechanism  in  the  area  of  national 
security? 
 
Regardless of the transfer tool used to transfer their personal data to the US, data subjects in the EU 
can submit a complaint to their national data protection authority to make use of the new redress 
mechanism in the area of national security. The national data protection authority, in turn, will ensure 
that  the  complaint  will  be  handed  over  to  the  EDPB,  which  will  transmit  the  complaint  to  the  US 
authorities that are competent to handle the complaint. Furthermore, the data protection authority 
will ensure that the data subject is provided information regarding the complaint handling process, 
including  with  regard  to  the  outcome  of  the  lodged  complaint.  For  a  complaint  to  be  admissible,

5.- Will the Adequacy Decision be reviewed? 
 
The first review of the Adequacy Decision will take place one year after it enters into force, to verify 
whether all elements have been fully implemented and effective in practice. Following the first review 
and depending on its outcome, the Commission will decide, in consultation with the EDPB and the EU 
Member States, on the periodicity of subsequent reviews, which will in any event take place at least 
every four years14. The EDPB and its members stand ready to actively take part in this evaluation.
