Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Warwickshire Police (WP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of WP, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  WP agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 06 September 2023 with representatives of WP to discuss the scope of the audit.  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Warwickshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report Executive Summary – January 2024         Page 3 of 7   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist WP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. WP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information (FOI)  REASONABLE There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with data protection legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Warwickshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report Executive Summary – January 2024         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations       The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made:   • There were 1 urgent, 7 high, 8 medium and 2 low priority recommendations. 1782Freedom of InformationAll scope areasBreakdown of priority recommendationsLowMediumHighUrgentWarwickshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report Executive Summary – January 2024         Page 5 of 7  Graphs and Charts       The pie chart above shows a summary of the assurance ratings awarded. 24% high assurance, 20% reasonable assurance, 52% limited assurance, 4% very limited assurance.   Warwickshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report Executive Summary – January 2024         Page 6 of 7  Areas for Improvement  • The completion rate of FOI requests within statutory timelines is below the required standard, and the persistent backlog of requests needs to be addressed as a priority.  • The publication scheme needs improvement to align with ICO guidance, including more frequent and scheduled releases within the relevant information classes. • FOI/EIR policies and procedures need to be comprehensive and should include provisions for the treatment of personal information. Regular reviews of these policies and procedures are necessary to ensure they remain current and compliant with relevant legislation. • There is need for further documentation of procedures within the FOI team. These are essential to prevent knowledge loss and ensure capability continuity when experienced staff members are unavailable or when staff are temporarily reassigned to support FOI handling.  • Quality assurance procedures should be documented. Routine and documented dip sampling of completed responses should be undertaken.    Warwickshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report Executive Summary – January 2024         Page 7 of 7  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
