Humberside Police  Freedom of Information audit report  April 2024     Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 2 of 7  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Humberside Police (HP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of HP, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  HP agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 23 November 2023 with representatives of HP to discuss the scope of the audit.  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI)  The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 3 of 7   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist HP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. HP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information (FOI)  REASONABLE There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with data protection legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations     The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made:   • There were 1 urgent, 6 high, 7 medium and 2 low priority recommendations.  Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 5 of 7  Graphs and Charts        The pie chart above shows a summary of the assurance ratings awarded. 32% high assurance, 36% reasonable assurance, 28% limited assurance, 4% very limited assurance.     Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 6 of 7  Areas for Improvement • HP is not currently meeting the statutory timescales for responding to FOI requests. HP should continue to monitor the level of resources it has in place, to ensure it is sufficient to handle incoming requests for access whilst also working through the existing backlog.  • HP have a publication scheme available on their website however, not enough information has been published to increase transparency and assist with reducing the number of new FOI requests. • HP do not have a documented comprehensive and overarching EIR policy and supporting procedures to cover the EIR legislation to ensure staff have standardised guidance to follow when handling such requests. • Ensure staff with responsibilities for the handling FOI and EIR requests, including senior staff with significant involvement are provided with EIR training suitable to their role. Staff should receive training at induction on how to recognise FOI and EIR requests which should be refreshed at regular intervals.  • Ensure existing guidance and reminders for staff appropriately demonstrates how to recognise FOI/EIR requests. This should include consideration as to how information might be provided to staff beyond the staff intranet and include methods to ensure that staff have read and understood the reminders.   Humberside Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 7 of 7  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
