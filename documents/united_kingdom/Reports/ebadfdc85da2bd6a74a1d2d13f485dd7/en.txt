Plymouth City CouncilData protection and freedom of information audit reportApril 2024 Plymouth City Council – ICO Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 2 of 11  Executive summary  Audit Methodology  The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 146 of the DPA 2018 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA 2018 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO is an independent, proportionate regulator and sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach. High standards of personal data protection compliance and freedom of information compliance help organisations innovate and deliver great services by building trust with the public. The ICO’s expertise and consistent approach to regulation provides certainty enabling organisations to feel confident to use personal data responsibly, innovate and support economic growth. Plymouth City Council (PCC) agreed to a consensual audit of its data protection, freedom of information and environmental information regulations (EIR) practices.  Plymouth City Council – ICO Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 3 of 11  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and PCC with an independent assurance of the extent to which PCC, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk based analysis of PCC’s processing of personal data. The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to PCC’s identified from ICO intelligence or PCC’s own concerns, or any issues or risks which affect its specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of PCC, the nature and extent of PCC’s processing of personal data and handling of information requests, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to PCC. It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following areas:  Scope area Description Governance & Accountability  The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the UK GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Requests for Access There are appropriate procedures in operation for recognising and responding to individuals’ requests for access to their personal data. Freedom of Information  The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the public authority.   Plymouth City Council – ICO Executive Summary – April 2024         Page 4 of 11  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist PCC in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Governance & Accountability  Reasonable  There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance.
