The ICO conducted a series of nine consensual audits involving ten police forces (with one being a joint force audit) between July 2023 and March 2024. The objective was to assess the extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance were in place and operational within each organisation.
This outcomes report highlights the key findings and shared themes from those nine audits. The report aims to assist police forces in identifying potential areas for improvement in their FOI practices as the recommendation themes apply broadly.
