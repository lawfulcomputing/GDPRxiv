Avon and Somerset Police Data protection audit report  June 2024    Avon and Somerset Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – June 2024        Page 2 of 8  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA 2018 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA 2018 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits.  The ICO is an independent, proportionate regulator and sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach. High standards of personal data protection compliance help organisations innovate and deliver great services by building trust with the public. The ICO’s expertise and consistent approach to regulation provides certainty enabling organisations to feel confident to use personal data responsibly, innovate and support economic growth. Avon and Somerset Police (A&S) agreed to a consensual audit of its data protection practices The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and A&S with an independent assurance of the extent to which A&S within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.   Avon and Somerset Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – June 2024        Page 3 of 8  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk based analysis of A&S’s processing of personal data.  The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to A&S identified from ICO intelligence or A&S’s own concerns, or any data protection issues or risks which affect its specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of A&S the nature and extent of A&S’s processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to A&S. It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope area Description Personal Data Breach Management and Reporting The extent to which the organisation has measures in place to detect, assess and respond to security breaches involving personal data, to record them appropriately and notify the supervisory authority and individuals where appropriate   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist A&S in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. A&S’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Avon and Somerset Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – June 2024        Page 4 of 8  Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Personal Data Breach Management and Reporting         Reasonable There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance.
