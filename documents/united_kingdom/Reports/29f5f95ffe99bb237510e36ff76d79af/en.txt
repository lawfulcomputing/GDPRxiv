Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Dyfed Powys Police (DPP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of DPP, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  DPP agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA.   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.   Dyfed Powys Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – November 2023         Page 3 of 7  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist DPP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. DPP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information (FOI)   Limited There is a limited level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering freedom of information compliance. The audit has identified considerable scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with freedom of information legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Dyfed Powys Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – November 2023         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations   The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made:   • There were 5 urgent, 9 high, 4 medium and 2 low priority recommendations.  Dyfed Powys Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – November 2023         Page 5 of 7  Graphs and Charts    The pie chart above shows a summary of the assurance ratings awarded. 23% high assurance, 19% reasonable assurance, 31% limited assurance, 27% very limited assurance.        Dyfed Powys Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – November 2023         Page 6 of 7  Areas for Improvement • DPP is not currently meeting the statutory timescales for responding to FOI requests. To mitigate the backlog, DPP is reaching out to individuals for overdue requests to determine whether these are still required, and closing cases where it does not receive a response. This is non-compliant with the FOI legislation. • DPP has faced several resourcing challenges, which it is still working to mitigate. It has now established a Gold Group to monitor this, and should continue work to ensure there are sufficient resources in place to allow responses to be provided within the statutory timescales. • DPP currently has a publication scheme on its website, however, due to resources, this is not being followed. DPP should review its publication scheme and work to ensure relevant information is proactively published. • FOI awareness is not sufficiently included in all staff training, and DPP does not currently have a way to monitor staff have read and understood policies and procedures. • Whilst there is a quality assurance process in place for new FOI handlers, there is currently no QA process for more experienced staff. Dip-sampling of completed cases takes place but is not regular or documented.    Dyfed Powys Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary – November 2023         Page 7 of 7  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
