The first stage of this project commenced in March 2022. The ICO requested the completion of two questionnaires sent to police forces across the United Kingdom. The survey questions were developed based on the risks and recommendations from our investigation reports and additional data protection requirements applicable to MPE.
We received responses from 41 police forces which were subsequently assessed, and the responses were also used to develop the next stage of the project.
The second stage of the project commenced in July 2022. We approached nine police forces across the UK between July 2022 and September 2023 to take part in a more detailed review of their MPE practices.
