North Yorkshire Police  Freedom of Information audit report  March 2024      North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 2 of 7  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and North Yorkshire Police (NYP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of NYP, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  NYP agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA.   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.   North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 3 of 7  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist NYP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. NYP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information (FOI) REASONABLE There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with FOIA legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.    North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations    The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made:   • There were one urgent, five high, two medium and one low priority recommendations.  1521Freedom of InformationBreakdown of priority recommendationsLowMediumHighUrgent North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 5 of 7  Graphs and Charts      The pie chart above shows a summary of the assurance ratings awarded. 65% high assurance, 8% reasonable assurance, 23% limited assurance, 4% very limited assurance.      65%8%23%4%Freedom of Information Assurance Rating SummaryHighReasonableLimitedVery Limited North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 6 of 7  Areas for Improvement  • Compliance with statutory timescales for responding to requests is inconsistent, with a notable decline through Q4 2023. This and the growing backlog of requests represents significant risk to ongoing compliance. NYP must continue to review and adjust resourcing strategies to meet demand and continue to explore efficiency enhancements.   • Although inexperienced FOI team members have all work reviewed, there is no documented quality assurance (QA) process for experienced team members who are signed off as competent to respond to FOI requests. NYP should establish documented QA mechanisms (eg routine peer review and dip sampling) across the whole team of FOI handlers. This will help to ensure that responses to requests are appropriate and thorough, and will allow identification of potential development needs within the FOI team.  • Refresher training within the FOI team should resume for all trained request handlers to ensure that knowledge and practices remain current. Any such refresher training should be documented to help demonstrate commitment to the ongoing development of team members.    North Yorkshire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary  v1.0– March 2024         Page 7 of 7  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
