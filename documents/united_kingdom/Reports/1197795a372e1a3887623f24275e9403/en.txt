Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Leicestershire Police (LP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of LP, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  LP agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA.   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.  Leicestershire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – February 2024         Page 3 of 7  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist LP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. LP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information (FOI)  REASONABLE  There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering freedom of information compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with freedom of information legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Leicestershire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – February 2024         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations      The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made:   • There were 3 urgent, 9 high, 6 medium and 1 low priority recommendations.  Leicestershire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – February 2024         Page 5 of 7  Graphs and Charts      The pie chart above shows a summary of the assurance ratings awarded. 24% high assurance, 20% reasonable assurance, 40% limited assurance, 16% very limited assurance.     Leicestershire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – February 2024         Page 6 of 7  Areas for Improvement  • Not all staff responsible for responding to FOI requests have received training specific to their role, and the training is not refreshed.  • Force-wide FOI training is also not refreshed, and LP does not currently actively monitor FOI training figures.  • LP does not currently have regular, documented QA or dip sampling processes in place to quality check FOI responses. • LP has a Publication Scheme in place, and proactively publish some areas of information, but it is currently working to ensure that all relevant information is proactively published. • There is potential that staff who handle Internal Reviews may have worked on the initial FOI request. Internal Reviews should be completed by a manager or senior member of staff.   Leicestershire Police – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Executive Summary v1.0 – February 2024         Page 7 of 7   Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
