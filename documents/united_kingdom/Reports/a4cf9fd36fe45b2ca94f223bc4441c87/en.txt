Environment Agency Freedom of Information audit reportOctober 2023 Environment Agency – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report v1.0 – October 2023         Page 2 of 7  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46.  The ICO is an independent, proportionate regulator and sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for public authorities and so aims to establish a participative approach. High standards of compliance with the relevant legislation can help public authorities maintain the trust and confidence of the public.  Following engagement with the ICO, the Environment Agency (EA) agreed to a consensual audit of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 3 July 2023 with representatives of the EA to discuss the scope of the audit. The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and the EA with an independent assurance of the extent to which the EA, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with FOIA and EIR requirements.   Environment Agency – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report v1.0 – October 2023         Page 3 of 7  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area:  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, remote interviews with selected staff, and a virtual review of evidential documentation.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with freedom of information legislation. In order to assist the EA in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. The EA’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion   Freedom of Information   REASONABLE There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering FOI compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with the FOIA.  *The assurance rating above is reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance. Scope area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which the information handling practices of the EA, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA. Environment Agency – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report v1.0 – October 2023         Page 4 of 7  Priority Recommendations     The bar chart above shows a breakdown of the priorities assigned to our recommendations made as part of this audit.

It was evident to ICO auditors that improving the EA’s timeliness in responding to FOI and EIR requests is a priority of the EA.  • The EA does not have adequate governance oversight of its FOI/EIR related activities. Through establishing and maintaining strong FOI/EIR leadership and oversight, clearly documenting policies, reporting lines and responsibilities, and ensuring effective information flows will help the EA to comply with their statutory obligations.   • Where the EA works in partnership with other organisations there is a lack of documented governance arrangements in relation to the handling of requests and/or the management of records. This could impact the timeliness of the EA to respond to FOI and EIR requests and result in a breach of FOI/EIR regulations.  • The EA’s publication scheme does not include all the information recommended by the ICO.   • The EA is not meeting the training needs of all new and existing staff in relation to FOI and EIR. Training and awareness are key to the EA satisfying statutory requirements.  • Some staff do not have the necessary management support, capacity or allocated time to meet their FOI/EIR obligations. This could result in a breach of FOI/EIR regulations.    Environment Agency – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report v1.0 – October 2023         Page 7 of 7  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
