An enforcement notice and a warning have been issued to the Home Office for failing to assess the privacy risks posed by the electronic monitoring of people arriving in the UK by unauthorised means. The ICO has been in discussion with the Home Office regarding its pilot to place ankle tags on, and track the GPS location of, up to 600 migrants who arrived in the UK and were on immigration bail. Although the pilot ended in December 2023, the Home Office has retained the GPS location data collected by the tags and will continue to be able to access and use that data including sharing it with other third-party organisations. The enforcement notice orders the Home Office to update its internal policies, access guidance and privacy information in relation to the data retained from the pilot. The warning issued also states that any future processing on the same basis will be in breach of data protection law and will attract enforcement action.
