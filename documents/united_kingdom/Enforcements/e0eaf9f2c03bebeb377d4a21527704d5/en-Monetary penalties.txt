defines 

direct marketing 

as "the communication

15. The Commissioner 

has issued 

statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties) 

(Maximum Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed Â£500,000. 

16. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended  and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights. 

17. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

Background 

to the case 

18. At  all 

material 

times TBDL provided 

energy switching 

services 

to 

consumers, 

under the trading 

name "Look After My Bills" 

("LAMB"). 

19. TBDL  has been registered 

with the Commissioner  as a  data 

controller 

since 17 April 2014, under registration 

number ZA048101. 

20. Mobile users can report the receipt 

of unsolicited marketing text 

messages to the Mobile UK's Spam Reporting 

Service by forwarding 

the

Information 

Office 

message to 7726 (spelling 

out "SPAM"). 

Mobile UK  is an organisation 

that represents 

the interests 

of mobile operators 

in the UK. The 

Commissioner 

is provided 

with access to the data on complaints 
made 

to the 7726 service 

and this data is 

used to ascertain organisations 

which may be 

acting in breach of PECR. 

21. TBDL most recently 

came to the attention 

of the Commissioner 

in 

March 2021, 

22. Searches 

of the 7726 database 

revealed 

that there was  a total of 1,109 

complaints 

about text messages containing 

the phrase 'Look  After 

My 

Bills' 

between 1 June 2020 and 27 March 2021. 

23. Searches 

of the complaints received 

via the ICO online reporting tool 

("OLRT") 

revealed 

a further 

three complaints 

about text messages 

containing 

the phrase 'Look  After 

My Bills' 

between June 2020 and 

February 

2021. 

24. Comments from the complainants 

included: 

"I filled in  an online enquiry a few weeks back, but decided not to 

continue. 

Despite emailing 

and asking them to remove me from 

thei [sic] systems I have 

continued 

to receive 

marketing 

messages. 

Calling them 0203 950 1166 only gives options for 1. 

Existing 

customers, 

or 2. You want to sign up." 

"I had previously 

texted STOP twice before but they continue 

to 

ignore that request. 

Please can you get them to stop texting 

me 

as I do not want their service 

or offers."

25. Some of the messages contained 

'bit.ly' 

links which redirected 

to 

various landing pages on the website https://lookaftermybills.com/. 

The website's 

privacy policy stated that "Look After My Bills is owned 

and operated 

by [TBDL]" and that "[TBDL] is the controller

27. The Commissioner 

conducted 

a separate 

search for email complaints 

and  found 

that 30 complaints 

had been received 

about unsolicited 

emails apparently 

sent by, or at the instigation 

of, TBDL between 24 

June 2020 and 27 March 2021. Of those, a number of the complaints

28. On 27 April 2021, an initial 

investigation 

letter was sent to TBDL 

informing 

them of the complaints 

which had been received 

regarding 

its direct marketing 

communications. 

The letter outlined 

the 

requirements 

of PECR and the  enforcement  powers  available 

to the

29. Following 

a request for a short extension, 

TBDL provided  a 

substantive 

response 

to the Commissioner's 

queries on 28 May 2021. The response 

confirmed 

that all 

1,112 text messages listed in the Commissioner's 

complaints 

spreadsheet 

(i.e. 1,109 '7726' complaints, 

and three OLRT 

complaints) 

were sent by TBDL, along with 13 out of the 30 emails 

which had 

been complained 

about. The remaining 

17 emails were sent 

by a German affiliate 

called Audience Serv GmbH ("ASG") and/or by 

affiliates 

of ASG. TBDL understood 

of ASG. 
that OOG was an affiliate 

30. Between 1 June 2020 and 4 May 2021, TBDL sent a total of 55,876,054 

emails and 3,700,474 

text messages, 

of which 55,846,575 

emails and 

3,452,109 

text messages were successfully 

delivered.  Over 

the same 

period, 

they received 

102,959 email opt-out requests 

and 37,715 text 

message opt-out requests. 

31. In terms of the email and text 

communications 

which it sent itself, 

TBDL explained 

that the data it relies on is obtained 

directly 

from 

customers 

via its website,  and 

that these details 

are not provided 

to 

affiliates. 

The mechanism used for obtaining 

consent can be found on 

the TBDL homepage. 

The homepage invites 

individuals 

to provide their 

email address and postcode 

to receive 

a quote via  a 'Get your quote in 

30 seconds' 

button. Immediately 

above this button is an unticked 

box 

alongside 

the following 

wording: 

"By ticking 

here, you agree we can 

send you occasional 

emails with incredibly 

helpful 

money saving tips." 

This is understood 

to be the point at which TBDL obtained consent 

for 

the purposes 

of its unsolicited 

direct marketing; 

it is notable that 

an 

individual 

does not provide their telephone 

number at this point, and 

there is no reference 

to direct marketing 

being sent by text message, 

with the opt-in box referring 

just to "occasional 

emails with incredibly 

helpful 

money saving tips" (emphasis 

are also 
added). Individuals 

provided  with a 

link to a privacy policy. 

The Commissioner 

considered 

9 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

this privacy 

policy  at 

the time and noted that  it did not 

expressly 

refer 

to  the fact that individuals  would 

receive 

direct marketing 

text 

messages. 

Under  the 

heading 'What communications 

you may receive 

from us', it stated: 

"a. Direct marketing 

communications 

We understand 

that some of our customers 

like to receive 
our 

newsletters 

and other information 

about our latest offers, products 
and 

promotions. 

You can choose to opt-in to receiving 

these direct 

marketing 

communications 

when you subscribe 

to our products 
and 

services.  You 

can also choose to opt-out of receiving 

these direct 

marketing 

communications 

at any time. 

b. Service communications 

Service communications  broadly 

comprise 

of communications 

which: 

1. we have a legal  or  regulatory 
obligation 

to send to you (such as 

communications 

which we are obliged 

by our regulator 

to send to 

you from time to time); 

2. we send in connection 

with the 

provision 

of our services 

to you; and 

3. we send so that we can provide services 

(such as 
at your  request 

password reset emails, 

which you may ask us to send if you do not 

remember your login 

credentials 

but want 

to access our products 

and  services)." 

32. The Commissioner 

understands 

that individuals  who 

click the button to 

obtain a quote are then 

taken to another webpage to provide  further 

details 

about themselves, 

including 

their full name, date of birth and, 

at this point, their telephone 

a mobile 
number. Whilst  entering 

10 

telephone 

number is not mandatory, 

there is nothing to advise 

individuals 

at this point that, by entering 

it,  they 

are taken to have 

consented 

to receiving 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

via text message.

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

33. TBDL indicated 

in its response 

that direct marketing 

by text message 

accounted 

for only around  10% 

of its total electronic 

marketing 

but 

acknowledged 

that the wording on its homepage could have been 

clearer 

to individuals 

about the possibility 

of direct marketing  being 

sent by text message. TBDL was asked whether 

there was a separate 

box which an individual 

could check 

to opt in to text message 

marketing, 

or to expressly 

opt out, to which it responded that 

there 

was not. 

34. TBDL noted that several 

of the text messages and emails contained 

in 

the spreadsheet 

provided 

by the Commissioner  would 

constitute 

service 

communications 

rather than direct marketing 

communications. 

For example, 

several 

of the communications 

notify TBDL's customers 

that TBDL has commenced the process of switching 

its customer's 

energy supplier 

in connection 

with the automatic 

switching 

service 

provided 

by  TBDL. 

35. TBDL explained 

that recipients 

of emails can opt out of direct 

marketing 

communications 

sent by TBDL by email by either: 

(i) using 

the unsubscribe 

hyperlink 

contained 

in any email which they receive 

from TBDL or (ii) contacting 

TBDL's customer services 

team and 

requesting 

to be unsubscribed 

from TBDL direct marketing. 

36. Similarly, 

recipients 

of text messages can opt out of direct marketing 

communications 

sent by TBDL by SMS by either: 

(i) replying 

"STOP" to 

any text message which they receive 

from TBDL or (ii) contacting 

11 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

TBDL's customer  services 

team and requesting 

to be unsubscribed 

from 

TBDL's direct marketing. 

37. TBDL explained  that, 

due to human error,  two 

of the  31  text 

message 

campaigns 

run by TBDL since 1 June 2020 did not contain opt-out 

instructions 

due to those text messages 

being incorrectly 

designated 

as 

service 

communications. 

38. Upon receipt 

of the Commissioner's 

letter,  TBDL  suspended 

their text 

message  marketing, 

and  a decision 

has since been taken to cease 

marketing 

by text 

message  altogether. 

It also identified 

the following 

four improvements 

which would be implemented 

as  a priority: 

"1. providing 

refresher 

training 

to its marketing, 

product and 

customer services 

teams on [TBDL's] 

obligations 

under  The 

Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC Directive) 

Regulations 
2003; 

2. updating 

the text on its homepage and in its privacy 

notices 

to 

make  more 

clear that: (i) service 

communications 

may be sent to 

customers 

by both email and SMS without their consent and (ii) 

direct marketing 

communications 

may be sent to customers 

by 

email only with their consent; 

3. undertaking 

an exercise 

to ensure that  service 

communications 

sent by email and SMS do not contain promotional 

material; 

and 

4. undertaking 

an exercise 

to ensure that all direct marketing 

communications 

sent by email contain opt-out instructions." 

39. TBDL explained 

that  its 

affiliates  obtained  data  either  directly  from 

individuals 

or from third  parties. 

It provided 

a  copy of its standard

ICO. 

Commissioner's

Office 

affiliate 

terms and conditions 

as evidence 

of the contract 

between TBDL 

and ASG. It stated that 

ASG "operates 

at arm's length from [TBDL] and 

[TBDL] is not responsible 

for its marketing 

activities". 

It advised the 

Commissioner 

to contact ASG directly 

for further 

information. 

40. The Commissioner  wrote 

to TBDL on 10 June 2021 with some further 

queries, 

and explained 

that, as an instigator 

of direct marketing 

communications 

sent by a third party, TBDL continues 

to be bound to 

comply with PECR. 

41. In its response 

on 24 June 2021, TBDL did not accept that it was the 

instigator 

of the emails sent by ASG and/or its affiliates. 

It reiterated 

that "[ASG] and [OOG] have always operated 

at an arms' [sic] length 

from [TBDL]" and "have  exercised 

their own judgement 

and discretion 

when determining 

to whom marketing 

emails are sent". 

42. TBDL confirmed 

that the total number 

of emails sent 

by ASG and/or 

OOG on behalf of TBDL over the period  20 

October 2020 to 10 May 

2021 was 45,322,164. 

All of the creative 

content of these emails was 

provided 

to ASG by TBDL. TBDL stated that it was unable to provide 

evidence 

of consent for the emails sent as this information 

was held by 

ASG and/or OOG. The total number of leads and/or sales 

generated 

by 

these emails was 621. 

43. In relation 

to the details 

collected 

via TBDL's own website, 

it provided  a 

screenshot 

of the webpage where individuals 

are asked to enter their 

mobile phone number. It confirmed 

that the mobile phone number field 

is not mandatory 

and that it is possible 

for individuals 

to request a 

quote without ticking 

the box to opt in to direct marketing.

sent for the purposes 

of direct 

marketing. 

TBDL also provided 

another spreadsheet 

listing 

the date 

and time the relevant 

subscriber 

provided 

their mobile phone number 

to it. The dates ranged from 11  March 

2019 to 18 May 2021. 56 of the 

mobile phone numbers were listed as 'not found'. 

45. TBDL also confirmed 

that a total of 104,949 direct marketing text 

messages were sent without opt-out instructions 

during August 2020 

and  September 

2020, due to the messages being incorrectly 

designated 

as service 

communications. 

46. On 28 June 2021, an email was sent to TBDL confirming 

that, based on 

the information 

provided, 

the Commissioner 

has formed the 

preliminary 

view that it was the  instigator 

of the emails sent by ASG 

and/or  OOG. 

The email highlighted 

OOG's status as a dormant 

company on Companies 

House, the director's 

occupation 

and country 

of residence 

and the lack of registration 

with the Commissioner, 

and 

explained 

that this raised concerns 

about the quality 

of the due 

diligence 

checks carried 

out by TBDL on its affiliates 

and sub-affiliates. 

Further 

information 

was sought by the Commissioner, 

including 

in 

relation 

to copies of the "application

by OOG and/or

on 2 July 2021 providing 

a spreadsheet 

showing the 

date and time the  consent 

was obtained 

for each of the  customers 

who 

received 

emails from TBDL. There were four customers 

whose email 

addresses 

could not be found. It was TBDL's assumption 

that these 

related 

to individuals 

who had requested 

that it deletes 

their data. 

48. TBDL continued 

to deny that it was the instigator 

of the emails sent by 

ASG and/or OOG, as it did not have a contract 

with OOG and was 

unaware of the relationship 

between ASG and OOG. However, it 

confirmed 

that it had  asked 

ASG to provide evidence 

of consent for the 

emails and  would 

forward this information 

on to the Commissioner 

as 

soon as it received 

this. 

49. TBDL provided 

a copy of the due diligence 

questionnaire 

completed 

by 

ASG on  1 October 2020. The form states that ASG is a trading 

name of 

Karma Response SL ("Karma"), 

which is a Spanish company based in 

Barcelona. 

The form states that they 

do not contract 

campaigns 

to subÂ­

and that email

are obtained 

via its website,

a copy of an 'insertion

2020 which forms part of TBDL's contractual 

relationship 

with ASG. The 

document contains 

details

out by Karma on behalf of TBDL (referred 

to in the document as

51. TBDL  also 

provided 

a copy of an ASG brochure 

entitled 

'Compliance 

Deck', which outlines 

the requirements 

of the GDPR and how ASG 

ensures compliance 

with the principles. 

The brochure 

includes 

examples of opt-in forms used by ASG to obtain consent. 

52. TBDL confirmed  that 

it was not made aware of the relationship 

between ASG and OOG when it appointed 

ASG as an affiliate. 

TBDL 

now shared the Commissioner's  concerns  about 

the extent of the due 

diligence  carried 

out by ASG on OOG and confirmed 

that it no longer 

works with ASG as  a result. 

53. ASG's website,

from ASG, despite 

its efforts, 

the Commissioner 

elected 

to 

contact OOG directly

has made the above findings 

of fact on the 

balance of probabilities.

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

81. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a contravention 

of regulations 

22 and 23 of PECR by TBDL and, if so, 

whether the conditions 

of section 

SSA DPA are satisfied. 

The contravention 

82. The Commissioner 

finds that TBDL 

contravened regulations 

22 and 23 

of PECR. 

83. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

84. The Commissioner 

finds that between 20 October 2020 and 10 May 

2021 there were 45,322,164 

direct marketing 

emails sent to 

subscribers 

on behalf of TBDL, of which 39,906,342 

were received. 

The 

Commissioner 

finds that TBDL instigated 

of those 
the transmission 

direct marketing 

messages, contrary 

to regulation 

22 of PECR. 

85. TBDL, as the instigator 

of the direct marketing emails, 

is required 

to 

ensure that 

it is acting in compliance 

with the requirements 

of 

regulation 22 

of PECR, and to ensure that valid consent to send those 

messages had been acquired. 

The Commissioner  is 

in this 
satisfied 

case that TBDL did 

not hold valid consent. 

86. During the Commissioner's 

investigation, 

that it 
TBDL has indicated 

does not consider 

itself 

to be the instigator 

of the direct marketing 

emails as it is claimed that the affiliates 

operate at arm's length from it 

and exercise 

their own judgement 

and discretion 

when determining 

to 

whom marketing 

emails are sent. However, it is understood 

that TBDL 

provides 

the creative 

content of the emails and has a contractual 
with ASG under which it pays ASG Â£â for each approved 

relationship 

sale. The Commissioner 

therefore 

takes the view that this arrangement 

27 

constitutes 

"positive 

encouragement" 

and is clearly 

"something 
more 

than the 

mere facilitation 

of the action concerned"

. The Commissioner 
5

therefore 

considers 

TBDL to be the instigator 

of the relevant 

emails. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

87. Accordingly, 

as instigator, 

it requires  consent 

for the emails  sent. 

Given 

that TBDL is reliant 

on its affiliates 

to obtain the data to use for sending 

the direct marketing relating 

to TBDL, this would constitute 'indirect 

consent'. 

88. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

says "organisations 

need to be aware that indirect 

texts, 
consent will not be enough for 

emails or automated 

calls.  This is 

because the rules on electronic 

marketing 

are  stricter,  to  reflect 

the more intrusive 

nature of electronic 

messages." 

89. However, it does go on to say that indirect 

consent may be valid, but 

only if it is clear and specific 

enough. If categories 

of organisations 

are 

referred 

to then those categories 

must be tightly defined 

and the 

organisation 

wanting to use the consent must clearly fall within 

the 

description. 

Consent is not likely 

to be valid where an individual 

is 

presented 

with a long, seemingly 

exhaustive 

list of categories 

of 

organisations. 

90. For consent to be valid it is required 

to be "freely 

given", 

by which it 

follows 

that if consent to marketing 

is a condition  of 

subscribing 

to a 

service, 

the organisation 

will have to demonstrate 

how the consent can 

be said to have been given freely.

91. Consent is  also 

required 

to be "specific" 

as to the type of marketing 

communication 

to be received, 

and the organisation, 

or  specific 

type of 

organisation, 

that will be sending it. 

92. Consent will not be "informed" if 

individuals 

do not understand 

what 

they are consenting 

to. Organisations 

should therefore 

always ensure 

that the language 

used  is 

clear, easy to understand, 

and not hidden 

away in a privacy policy  or 

small print. Consent will not be valid if 

individuals 

are asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or  other 

similar 

generic description. 

93. The Commissioner 

considers 

upon by ASG 
that the consent  relied 

and/or OOG to send emails on behalf of TBDL is invalid 

for  a  number 

of 

reasons: 

â¢  The promotions 

offered 

in the sites from which the "consents" 

are 

obtained 

are entirely unrelated 

to the energy sector. 

â¢  ASG is not named  on any of the websites 

operated 

by the third 

party companies. 

â¢  TBDL and OOG are not specifically 

named on  any of 

the websites, 

including 

the website operated 

by ASG (London Shave Products). 

â¢  In  order 

to participate 

to 
in the promotions,  users 

are required 

agree to marketing 

from companies 

operating 

in numerous 

different 

sectors. 

â¢  Consent is not granular

Office 

â¢  One of the websites 

is partly in German and another is 

partly in 

Dutch so English-speaking 

users cannot be expected 

to 

understand 

what they are consenting 

to. 

â¢  The email addresses 

were collected 

between 2013 

and 2021 so 

the data is up to eight years' old. 

94. The Commissioner 

therefore 

takes the view 

that TBDL did not hold 

valid consent for the 39,906,342 

direct marketing emails 

received 

by 

subscribers. 

95. Furthermore, Commissioner 

finds that between 

1 June 2020 

and 4 May 

2021 there were also 1,601,555 

direct marketing 

text  messages 

transmitted 

to  subscribers  by  TBDL, 

of which 1,511,547 

were received. 

The Commissioner 

finds that TBDL transmitted 

those direct marketing 

messages,  contrary 

to regulation 

22 of PECR. 

96. Of those 1,511,547 

direct marketing 

text messages which were 

received 

by subscribers, 

102,132 of them did not contain 

a valid optÂ­

out address in contravention 

of regulation 

23(b) of PECR. 

97. TBDL, as the sender of the direct marketing 

text messages, is 

required 

to ensure that it is acting in compliance 

with the requirements 

of 

regulation 

22 and 23(b) of PECR, and to ensure that valid consent to 

send those messages had been acquired, 

and that they 

include 

a valid 

address  to  which 

the recipient 

of the communication 

may send a 

request that  such 

communications 

cease. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

in this instance 

that such valid consent was not held. 

30 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

98. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that TBDL cannot avail itself 

of the 'soft 

opt-in' 

exemption 

provided 

by regulation 

22(3) PECR as, contrary 

to 

the requirements 

of regulation 

22(3)(c) 

were not 
PECR, individuals 

provided 

with a simple means of refusing 

the use of their contact 

details 

for the purposes 

of such direct marketing 

via text message, at 

the time that the details 

were initially 

collected. 

99. The Commissioner 

makes this finding 

because whilst the data TBDL 

used was obtained 

from its own website, 

individuals providing consent 

were unable to specify 

the method by which they might wish to receive 

marketing, specifically 

the TBDL website referred 

only to email 

marketing. 

The consent obtained 

is therefore 

not appropriately specific. 

100. The Commissioner 

is therefore satisfied 

that TBDL did not have the 

necessary 

valid consent for the 1,S11,S47 

direct marketing text 

messages which 

were received 

by subscribers. 

101. The Commissioner 

is further 

satisfied 

that in respect of 102,132 of the 

1,S11,S47 

direct marketing 

text messages, 

the actions 

of TBDL have 

contravened 

regulation 

23 PECR. 

102. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the  contravention 

103. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because between 1 June 2020 and 10 May 

2021, TBDL transmitted 

or instigated 

the transmission 

of  a total of 

41,417,889 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

communications 

(39,906,342 

emails which it had instigated, 

and 1,S11,S47 

text messages which it 

31 

had itself 

transmitted)  to 

subscribers 

who had not consented 

to 

receiving 

such communications, 

in contravention 

of regulation 

22(2) of 

PECR.

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

104. Furthermore, 

of the 1,511,547 

direct marketing 

text messages which 

were received 

by subscribers 

having been transmitted 

by TBDL, 

102,132 were sent without the necessary 

opt-out information 

as 

required 

by regulation 

23(b) PECR. 

105. Over  this 

same period, 

a  total 

of 1,062 complaints 

relating 

to TBDL's 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

were received 

by the Commissioner 

and 

the 7726 spam reporting 

service. 

106. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA(l) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

107. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was  deliberate. 

The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that TBDL 

deliberately 

set out 

to contravene 

PECR in this instance. 

108. The Commissioner 

has gone on  to consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two 

elements: 

109. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether TBDL knew  or  ought 

reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a  risk 

that these contraventions 

would 

occur.  This  is not  a high 

bar, and he is  satisfied 

that  this 

condition 

is 

met. 

32 

110. As a  well-established 

organisation 

with a business 

model that relies 

heavily 

on direct marketing, 

the Commissioner 

considers 

it reasonable 

as a  general 

principle 

that TBDL should have been aware of the rules 

that apply to such communications. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

111. The Commissioner 

has published 

detailed 

guidance 

for those carrying 

out direct marketing explaining 

their  legal 

obligations 

under PECR. This 

guidance 

gives clear advice regarding 

the requirements 

of consent for 

direct marketing 

and explains 

the circumstances 

under which 

organisations 

are able to  carry 

out marketing 

over the phone, by text, 

by email, by post, or by fax. In particular 

it  states that organisations 

can generally 

only send, or instigate, 

marketing 

messages to 

individuals 

if  that person 

has specifically 

consented 

to receiving 

them; 

and highlights 

the difficulties 

of relying 

on indirect 

consent for 

electronic 

mail. The Commissioner 

has also published 

detailed 

guidance 

on consent under 

the GDPR. In case organisations 

remain unclear on 

their obligations, 

the ICO  operates a 

telephone 

helpline. 

ICO 

communications 

about previous 

enforcement 

action where businesses 

have not complied 

with PECR are also readily 

available. 

TBDL has been 

registered 

with the ICO since 2014 so they should reasonably 

have 

been aware of the ICO guidance, 

and the enforcement 

action taken by 

the Commissioner 

against 

companies 

that have sent unsolicited 

marketing 

of PECR. 
messages in contravention 

112. Finally, 

TBDL ought to have recognised 

the inherent 

risks associated 

with using affiliates. 

Their standard 

affiliate 

'terms and conditions' 

contain warranties 

regarding 

compliance 

with data protection 

legislation, 

including 

the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

Directive 

2002/58/EC, 

but no specific 

requirements 

regarding 

consent. 

They did  ask 

ASG to complete 

a two-page due diligence 

questionnaire 

which required 

ASG to confirm that they had consent to send emails 

33 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

and could provide evidence 

of consent if requested. 

However, they 

appear  to 

have taken the answers at face value. 

113. It  is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that TBDL should have been, and 

in this area. 
indeed were, aware of its responsibilities 

114. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on  to consider 

whether TBDL 

failed to 

take reasonable 

steps to 

prevent the contraventions. 

Again, he 

is satisfied 

that this  condition 

is met. 

115. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing  guidance 

makes clear that 

organisations 

utilising  marketing 

lists from  a third party must 

undertake 

rigorous 

checks to satisfy 

themselves 

data 
that the personal 

was obtained 

fairly 

and lawfully, 

and that they have the necessary 

consent. 

It is not 

acceptable 

to rely on  assurances 

given by third party 

suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper due diligence. 

116. In  relation to 

the emails sent on its behalf, 

if TBDL had visited 

the 

website listed on 

the  due diligence 

questionnaire 

completed 

by  ASG, 

they would 

have realised 

that the website was partly in German and 

that ASG did  not 

have valid consent to send emails on behalf of TBDL. 

117. Furthermore, 

before embarking 

on  a text marketing 

campaign in 

August 2020, TBDL should have ensured that the wording of the opt-in 

statement 

on their own website covered the sending of direct 

marketing 

via text message. The high number  of  opt-out 

requests 

received in 

relation 

to the text messages (37,715 out of  a total of 

1,511,547 

messages sent) should have alerted 

them to the problem 

and caused them to  double-check 

the wording. 

34 

118. In the circumstances, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that TBDL failed to 

take reasonable 

steps to prevent the contraventions. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

119. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision to issue a 

monetary penalty 

120. Having consideration 

of the seriousness 

of the contravention, 

the 

duration 

of the contravention, 

the negligent 

nature of the breach, and 

having regard  to 

comparator 

cases, the Commissioner 

considers 

that 

an appropriate  starting 

point for the penalty is Â£1S0,000. 

121. The Commissioner 

has not identified 

any relevant 

aggravating 

features 

of this case. 

122. The Commissioner 

has taken into account the following 

mitigating 

features 

of this case: 

â¢  TBDL's employees 

have since been provided 

with refresher 

training relating 

to compliance 

with PECR; 

â¢  TBDL has ensured that all of its subsequent 

direct marketing 

communications 

include 

the requisite 

opt-out instructions; 

â¢  TBDL's Privacy 

Notice has been  updated; 

â¢  TBDL is actively 

reviewing 

the content of their service 

communications 

to ensure no direct marketing 

material 

is 

inadvertently 

included; 

35 

â¢  TBDL has ceased all SMS  text 

message direct marketing; 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

â¢  TBDL has terminated 

its arrangement 

with ASG. 

123. In light of the above mitigating 

factors, 

the Commissioner considers 

that the penalty should be reduced by Â£50,000 to Â£100,000. 

124. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

the currently 

available 

financial 

information 

for TBDL, and the likely 

impact of  a monetary 

penalty on the company. The Commissioner 

in the 
considers 

circumstances 

that a penalty remains the appropriate 

course of action 

in the  circumstances 

of this case, however, 

on the basis of the financial 

information 

available, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to further 

reduce 

the penalty by Â£70,000 to Â£30,000. 

125. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under 

section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

126. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

in which 

the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

to the 
TBDL responded 

Notice of Intent, 

indicating 

that it accepted 

the outcome of the 

investigation 

and did not wish to challenge 

the Commissioner's 

decision. 

127. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

128. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing a 

monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The sending of 

36 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

unsolicited 

direct marketing messages is a  matter  of 

significant 
public 

concern.  A 

monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging 

in these practices. 

The issuing 

of a 

monetary penalty will reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that 

they are only messaging 

those who specifically 

consent to receive 

direct marketing. 

129. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has had  regard 

to the factors 

set out 

in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature 

and level  of  risks 

associated 

with  non-compliance, 
including 

the risks to 

economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to achieve compliance 

and reasons  for 

its failure; 

the willingness 

and ability 

of the business 

to 

address non-compliance; 

the likely impact of the proposed intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely impact of the proposed  intervention 

on 

the wider business community, 

both in terms of deterring 

nonÂ­

compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

130. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a 

monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

131. Taking into 

decided 
account all of the above, the Commissioner  has 

that  a penalty in the sum of Â£30,000 (thirty thousand  pounds) 

is 

reasonable 

and proportionate 

given the particular 

facts of 

the case and 

the underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

the penalty.

Conclusion 

132. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 
office by 

BACS  transfer 

or cheque by 5 September 2023 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

133. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

4 September 2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary 

penalty by 20% to Â£24,000 (twenty four thousand  pounds). 

However, you should be aware that 

is not 
the early payment discount 

available 

if you decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

134. There is a right of appeal to the  First-tier 
Tribunal 

(Information 

Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

135. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

136. Information 

about appeals is set out in Annex 1. 

137. The Commissioner 

will not take action to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

38 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

â¢ the period specified 

within the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

â¢ all relevant 

appeals against the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation  of 

it have either been decided  or 

withdrawn; 

and 

â¢ the period for appealing 

against the monetary penalty and any 

variation 

of it has expired. 

138. In  England,  Wales 

and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty is 

recoverable 

by Order of the County Court or  the  High  Court.  In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff 

court of any sheriffdom
