SUPERVISORY  POWERS  OF  THE  INFORMATION  COMMISSIONER 

ENFORCEMENT  NOTICE 

To:  Outsource Strategies Ltd 

Of: 

7-8  Brigantine Place,  Cardiff,  Wales,  CFl0 4LN

1.

The  Information  Commissioner  ("the  Commissioner")  has  decided to

issue  Outsource Strategies Ltd  ("OSL")  with an  enforcement  notice

under  section  40 of the Data  Protection  Act  1998  ("DPA").  The notice is

being  issued  because of a  serious  contravention  of regulation  21  of the

Privacy  and  Electronic Communications  (EC  Directive)  Regulations  2003

("PECR").

2.

This  notice  explains  the  Commissioner's  decision.

Leg a I  framework 

3.

OSL,  whose  registered office is  given above  (Companies  House

Registration  Number:  12553312) is  the  organisation  stated in  this

notice  to have used a  public  electronic  communications  service for the

purpose of making  unsolicited calls  for  the  purposes  of direct  marketing

contrary  to  regulation  21  of PECR.

4.

Regulation  21 applies to the making of  unsolicited calls  for  direct

marketing  purposes.  It  means  that if a  company  wants  to make calls

promoting  a  product  or  service  to  an  individual who has  a telephone 

number  which is  registered  with the Telephone  Preference  Service  Ltd 

("TPS"),  then  that  individual  must  have notified  the  company  that they 

do  not  object to  receiving  such  calls  from it. 

5. 

Regulation  21  paragraph  (1)  of  PECR  provides  that: 

"(1) A person shall neither 

use, nor instigate 

the use of, a public 

electronic 

communications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 

unsolicited 

calls for direct 

marketing 

purposes 

where-

(a) the called line is that of a subscriber 

who has previously 

notified 

the caller 

that such calls should not for the time being 

be made on that line; or 

(b) the number allocated 

to a subscriber 

in respect 

of the called 

line is one listed 

in the register 

kept under regulation 

26. 11 

6. 

Regulation  21  paragraphs  (2),  (3),  (4) and  (5) provide  that: 

"(2) A subscriber 
of paragraph 
(1). 

shall not permit his line to be used in contravention 

(3) A person shall not be held to have contravened 

paragraph 

(1)(b) 

where the number allocated 

to the called 

line has been listed 

on the 

register 

for  less  than 

28 days preceding 

that on which the call is 

made. 

( 4) Where a subscriber 

who has caused a number allocated 

to a line of 

his to be listed 

in the register 

kept under regulation 

26 has notified 

a caller 

that he does not, for the time being, object to such calls 

2 

being  made  on that line  by  that  caller,  such calls may be made by 

that caller  on that line,  notwithstanding that  the  number  allocated 

to that  line  is  listed  in  the  said  register. 

(5)  Where a  subscriber has  given a  caller notification pursuant  to 

paragraph (4)  in  relation to a line  of  his-

(a)  the subscriber  shall be free  to  withdraw that  notification at 

any time,  and 

(b)  where  such notification  is  withdrawn,  the caller shall not 

make  such  calls  on that line." 

7. 

Under  regulation  26 of  PECR,  the  Commissioner  is  required to  maintain 

a  register  of numbers allocated  to  subscribers who  have  notified  them 

that  they  do  not  wish,  for  the  time  being,  to  receive unsolicited calls  for 

direct  marketing purposes on  those lines.  The Telephone Preference 

Service  Limited  ("TPS")  is  a limited  company  which  operates  the 

register  on the Commissioner's  behalf.  Businesses  who  wish  to  carry 

out  direct  marketing  by  telephone  can  subscribe  to  the TPS for  a  fee 

and  receive  from  them  monthly  a  list  of numbers  on  that  register. 

8. 

Section  122(5)  of  the DPA18  defines  direct  marketing as  "the 

communication  (by  whatever  means)  of  any advertising material which 

is  directed  to  particular  individuals".  This  definition  also  applies  for  the 

purposes  of PECR  (see regulation  2(2)  PECR  &  Schedule  19 paragraphs 

430  &  432(6)  DPA18). 

9. 

"Individual" is  defined  in  regulation  2(1) of  PECR  as  "a  living individual 

and  includes  an unincorporated body of such individuals". 

3 

10.  A  "subscriber" is defined  in regulation  2(1) of PECR  as  "a  person  who  is 

a  party  to a  contract  with  a  provider of  public  electronic 

communications  services for the  supply  of such services". 

11.  The DPA contains enforcement provisions at Part V  which  are 

exercisable  by  the  Commissioner.  Those  provisions are  modified  and 

extended for  the purposes of PECR by  Schedule  1  PECR. 

1 2.  Section  40(1)(a)  of  the  DPA  (as extended and modified  by  PECR) 

provides that if the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  that a  person  has 

contravened or is contravening  any  of  the  requirements  of  the 

Regulations,  he  may  serve  him  with  an Enforcement Notice  requiring 

him to  take  within such  time as may  be specified  in  the  Notice,  or to 

refrain  from  taking  after  such  time as may  be  so specified,  such  steps 

as  are  so  specified. 

13.  PECR  were  enacted  to  protect the individual's fundamental  right to 

privacy  in  the electronic communications sector.  PECR  were 

subsequently  amended and strengthened.  The Commissioner will 

interpret PECR  in  a  way  which is consistent with  the  Regulations' 

overall aim  of  ensuring  high levels  of protection  for  individuals'  privacy 

rights. 

14.  The  provisions of the  DPA remain  in  force for  the  purposes of PECR 

notwithstanding the  introduction  of  the  DPA18:  see paragraph  58(1)  of 

Schedule  20 to  the  DPA18. 

4 

The contravention 

15.  The  Commissioner  finds that  OSL contravened  regulation  21 of PECR. 

16.  The  Commissioner  finds  that  the contravention was as follows: 

17.  Between  11  February  2021 to 22 March  2022,  OSL used  a public 

telecommunications service for  the  purposes of making  1,346,503 

unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the 

number  allocated  to  the  subscriber in  respect  of  the called  line  was  a 

number  listed  on  the  register  of numbers kept by  the Commissioner in 

accordance  with  regulation  26, contrary  to  regulation 21(1)(b) of PECR. 

This resulted in  74 complaints being  made  to the TPS  and  the 

Commissioner. 

18.  The Commissioner  is also  satisfied  for the purposes of regulation  21 

that  these  1,346,503 unsolicited  direct  marketing calls were made  to 

subscribers  who  had registered  with  the  TPS  at  least  28  days prior  to 

receiving  the  calls,  and  who  for  the  purposes of  regulation  21(4)  had 

not  notified OSL that they  did  not  object to  receiving such calls. 

19. 

For such notification  to  be  valid  under regulation  21( 4 ), the individual 

must  have  taken a clear  and  positive action  to override their TPS 

registration  and  indicate  their  willingness to receive marketing  calls 

from  the  company.  The  notification  should  reflect the individual's 

choice about whether or not they  are willing  to receive marketing calls. 

Therefore,  where signing  up to  use  a product  or  service is  conditional 

upon  receiving  marketing  calls,  companies  will  need  to demonstrate 

how  this constitutes a  clear  and  positive notification  of the  individual's 

willingness to receive  such calls. 

5 

20.  The notification must clearly indicate the individual's willingness to 

receive marketing calls specifically.  Companies cannot rely on 

individuals opting in to marketing communications generally,  unless it 

is clear that this  will  include telephone  calls. 

21. 

Further,  the notification  must demonstrate  the individual's willingness 

to receive marketing  calls from that  company  specifically.  Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes of regulation 21(4) if individuals are 

asked to agree to receive  marketing  calls from "similar organisations", 

"partners",  "selected third parties" or other similar generic descriptions. 

22.  The Commissioner has considered,  as he is required to do under 

section  40(2) of the  DPA (as  extended and modified by PECR) when 

deciding whether to serve an  Enforcement  Notice,  whether any 

contravention  has caused or is likely  to cause any person damage.  The 

Commissioner  has decided that it  is  unlikely that damage has been 

caused in this instance. 

23. 

In view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby 

gives notice that,  in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the 

DPA,  he requires OSL to take the steps specified in Annex 1 of this 

Notice. 

Right of Appeal 

24.  There is a right  of  appeal  against this  Notice to the  First-tier Tribunal 

(Information Rights),  part of the  General  Regulatory Chamber. 

Information about  appeals is set out in  the  attached Annex  2.
