Commissioner 

("the Commissioner") 

has decided to 

issue Skean Homes Ltd ("Skean") 

with a monetary penalty under

and 24 of the 

Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 

("PECR"). 

2.  This notice explains

8.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to  subscribers 

who have notified 

them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

calls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes 

on those lines. 

TPS is a limited 

company 

which operates 

the register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to 

the  TPS  for 

a fee  and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on 

that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

material 

or 

marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This 

definition 

also applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) 

PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a living individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty if 

the Commissioner

if the person

contravention. 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance under 

section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website.

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which 

is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the  DPA18:  see 

paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18.

Background to the case 

16. At all material 

times, Skean operated 

as a home improvement 

company with the aim of improving 

energy efficiency 

and reducing 

household 

bills. 

Skean was incorporated 

on 11 November 2020 at the 

registered office 

address of 41 Manor Road,  Bournemouth, 

BH 1 3EU. 

The registered 

address for Skean was amended at Companies  House 

on 17 August 2023 to Wilson House, 2 Lorne Park Road, Bournemouth, 

BHl 1JN. 

17. Skean has one active director, 

Manasa Veena Ma midi, who was 

appointed 

on 11 November 2020. 

18. Skean first registered 

with the Information 

Office as a 
Commissioner's 

data controller 

on 6 January 2021, under registration 

number 

ZA840651. 

19. Skean has been authorised 

by the Financial 

Conduct Authority 

as an 

introducer 

appointed 

representative since 7 April 2021. 

20. Skean first came to the attention 

of the Commissioner 

in 2022 as part 

of an operation 

formed to assess and analyse  complaint 

trends in 

relation 

to the energy and home improvement 

sector. 

The 

Commissioner 

identified 

a number of complaints 

against "Eco Hub", 

"Driveway 

Solutions" 

and "Eco Driveways", 

in which complainants 

stated that the calls were promoting energy 

grants for resin driveways 

and the caller had a strong Middle Eastern accent. 

21. On 15 June 2022, the Commissioner 

issued a third party information 

notice to

•  The account was not transferred 

to a third party during the

period. 

41. The Commissioner 

has made the above findings 

of fact on the 

balance of probabilities. 

42. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a 

contravention 
whether the conditions 

of regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR by Skean and, if so, 

of section SSA DPA are satisfied. 

12 

The contravention 

43. The Commissioner 

finds that Skean contravened 

21 and 24 
regulations 

of PECR. 

44. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

45. Between 2 March 2022 and 31 May 2022, Skean used and/or instigated 

the use of a public telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of 

making 614,342 unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to 

subscribers 

where the number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of 

the called line was a number listed on 

the register of 

numbers kept by 

the Commissioner 

in accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to 

regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. This resulted 

in 31 complaints 

being made 

to the TPS and the Commissioner. 

46. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 614,342 unsolicited 

direct  marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not  notified 

Skean that they did not object to receiving 

such calls. 

47. For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21(4), the individual 

must have taken 

a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

13 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

48. The notification must 

clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing calls 

specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

49. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive marketing 

calls  from  that  company 

specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions. 

50. Skean has not provided 

any evidence 

of the notifications 

or consents 

obtained. 

51. Further, 

Skean failed, 

as required 

by regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

of the calls with the particulars 

specified 

at regulation 

24(2) of PECR. 

52. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider whether 

the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

53. 

The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because there have been multiple 

breaches 

of regulations 

21 and 24 by Skean arising 

from the organisation's 

activities 

between 2 March 2022 and 31 May 2022, and this led to 

614,342 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made to subscribers 

who were registered 

with the TPS and who had not notified 

Skean that 

14 

they were willing 

to receive 

such calls, 

and 31 complaints 

being made 

as a result. 

54. The Commissioner 

is therefore  satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

55. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

Skean's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions 

(even if Skean did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

56. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that Skean deliberately 

set out to 

contravene 

PECR in this instance. 

57. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was  negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two 

elements: 

58. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether Skean knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a risk that this contravention 

would occur. 

He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met. Given that  Skean 

relied 

heavily 

on direct marketing 

due to the nature of their business, 

it 

should reasonably 

have sought to  familiarise 

itself 

with the relevant 

legislation. 

Skean had also been registered 

with the Information 

Commissioner's  Office 

as a data controller 

and should therefore 

have 

been aware of the requirements 

of PECR compliance. 

15 

59. The Commissioner 

has also published 

detailed 

guidance 

for companies 

carrying 

out marketing 

explaining 

their legal requirements 

under PECR. 

This guidance 

explains 

the circumstances 

under which organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the phone, by text, by email, by 

post or by fax. Specifically, 

it states that live calls must not be made to 

any subscriber 

registered 

with the TPS, unless the subscriber 

has 

specifically 

notified 

the company that they do not object to receiving 

such calls. 

In case organisations 

remain unclear on their obligations, 

the ICO operates 

a telephone 

helpline. 

ICO communications 

about 

previous 

enforcement 

action where businesses 

have not complied  with 

PECR are  also  readily 

available. 

60. It is therefore 

reasonable 

to expect that Skean should have been aware 

in this area. 
of its responsibilities 

61. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether Skean 

failed to take reasonable 

steps  to

that this condition

data 
that the personal 

was obtained 

fairly  and 

lawfully, 

that  their 

details 

would be passed 

along for direct marketing 

to the specifically  named 

organisation 

in the 

case of live calls, 

and that they have the necessary  notifications 

for the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21 ( 4). It is not acceptable 

to rely on assurances 

given by third party suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper due 

diligence. 

Skean did not provide any evidence 

of due diligence 

undertaken. 

16 

63. Skean did not identify 

itself 

on the calls and/or provided 

false company 

names including 

'Eco Hub, Driveway 

Solutions 

and Eco Driveways'. 

64. Reasonable 

steps in these circumstances 

may also have included: 

screening 

the data itself 

against 

the TPS register 

(regardless 

of any 

assurances 

that might have been given by third parties); 

maintaining 

clear records of any consent provided 

by an individual 

for Skean to 

contact them; providing  suitable 

training 

to employees 

to ensure they 

understand 

their data  protection 

obligations; 

performing 

regular 

reviews of their marketing 

databases 

to ensure data is fit for purpose; 

carry out due  diligence 

checks on third parties; 

ensure appropriate 

agreements 

are in place with third parties 

providing 

or handling 

data; 

and monitor 

and record compliance 

issues where necessary. 

65. Given the volume of calls and complaints, 

it is clear that Skean  failed 

to 

take  those 

reasonable 

steps. 

66. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision to issue a monetary penalty 

67. The Commissioner 

identified 

no additional 

aggravating 

factors. 

68. The  Commissioner 

did not identify 

any mitigating 

features 

of this case. 

69. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions  from 
section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

558 have been 

complied 

with. 

17 

70. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

in which the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

In reaching 

his final 

view, the Commissioner 

has taken into  account 

the representations 

made by Skean on this matter. 

71. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

72. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

73. The Commissioner 

has considered 

the likely 

impact of a monetary 

penalty on Skean. In doing so, the Commissioner 

has given careful 

consideration 

to the representations 

to the 
made by Skean in response 

Notice of Intent. 

However, the Commissioner 

has decided that a 

penalty nevertheless 

remains the appropriate 

course of action in the 

circumstances 

of this case. 

74. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice 

is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently  engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity 

to reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning 

consumers 

who are not registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically 

indicate 

that they 

do not object to receiving  these 

calls. 

75. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

18 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingn

ess and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely 

impact of 

the proposed intervention 

on  the business, 

and the likely 

impact of the 

proposed intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

76. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

77. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £100,000 (one hundred thousand 

pounds) is reasonable 

and proportionate 

facts of 
given the particular 

the case and the underlying objective 
in imposing 

the penalty. 

Conclusion 

78. The monetary  penalty  must 

office by 
be paid to the Commissioner's 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 14 February 2024 at the latest. 

The 

monetary  penalty 

is not kept by the Commissioner  but  will 

be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

79. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary  penalty 

by 

13 February 2024 the Commissioner  will 

reduce the monetary 

penalty by 20% to £80,000 (eighty thousand  pounds). 

However, 

you should be aware that the early payment discount 

is not available 

if 

you decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

19 

80. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal (Information 

Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

81. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

82. Information 

about appeals is set out in Annex 1. 

83. The Commissioner 

will not take action to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

•  the period specified 

within the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not  been 

paid; 

•  all  relevant 

appeals against the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn; 

and 

•  the period for 

appealing 

against the monetary penalty and any 

variation 

of it has expired. 

84. In England, 

Wales and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty is 

recoverable 

by Order of the County Court or the High Court. In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as 

an extract 

registered 

decree  arbitral 

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff 

court of any sheriffdom 

in Scotland.
