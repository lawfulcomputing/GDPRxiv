Chief Constable Devon and Cornwall Police have continuously infringed Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of the DPA 2018 for over four years. In this case, Devon and Cornwall Police have had a subject access request backlog since 2018 which has resulted in a large number of subject access requests not being responded to within the legislative timeframe of one or three (where extension is appropriately applied) calendar months.
