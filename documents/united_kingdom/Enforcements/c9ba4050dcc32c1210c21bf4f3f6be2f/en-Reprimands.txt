and Cornwall Police) in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the UK General 
Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and Schedule 13(2)(c) of the Data

The reprimand 

1.2 The Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to Devon and 
Cornwall Police in respect of the following infringements of the UK GDPR 
and the DPA 2018: 

• Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR

This states: 

‘The controller shall provide information on action taken on a 
request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue 
delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. 
That period may be extended by two further months where 
necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the 
requests.’  

1 

•  Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of the DPA 2018 

 
This states:  
 
‘(1) This section defines “the applicable time period” for the 
purposes of sections 45(3)(b) and 48(2)(b). 
 
(2) “The applicable time period” means the period of 1 month, or 
such longer period as may be specified in regulations, beginning 
with the relevant time. 
 
(5) Regulations under subsection (2) may not specify a period which 
is longer than 3 months.’ 

 
1.3 The reasons for the Commissioner’s findings are set out below. 
 
Devon & Cornwall Police are the police force responsible for policing the 
counties of Devon and Cornwall in South West England. Devon and 
Cornwall Police formed an alliance with Dorset Police in April 2017 known 
as the Devon and Cornwall Police & Dorset Police Alliance (the Alliance). 
The two police forces formed the Alliance to enable them to work together 
to improve delivery, resilience and flexibility, as well as save money and 
increase efficiency in over 30 administrative and operational business 
areas, including data protection. 
 
Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of 
the DPA 2018 
 
From the information provided by the Alliance during the course of the  
investigation, it was found that Devon and Cornwall Police have 
continuously infringed Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 
3, Section 54 of the DPA 2018 for over four years. In this case, Devon 
and Cornwall Police have had a subject access request backlog since 
2018.  
 
The subject access request statistics provided by the Alliance show that in 
August 2022, Devon and Cornwall Police had 373 overdue subject access 
requests. Of these 373 overdue subject access requests, 33% (128) of 
the subject access requests were older than seven months, and 19% (71) 
were older than a year. More recent statistics show that as of November  
2023, Devon and Cornwall Police had 347 subject access requests 

 

2 

awaiting a response. Of these 347 subject access requests, 83% (287) of 
the subject access requests were older than one month, and 22% (78) 
were older than four months. This evidences Devon and Cornwall Police’s 
failure to respond to subject access requests in accordance with Article 
12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of the DPA 2018. 
 
Mitigating factors 
 
1.4 It has been noted that during the course of 2023 Devon and Cornwall 
Police have been increasing their staffing levels. It is acknowledged that it 
does take time and resources to fully train up new data protection staff 
before significant impacts can be made on Devon and Cornwall Police’s 
subject access request backlog. Whilst outstanding overdue requests 
remained, it can however be seen that the increased staffing levels 
introduced in April 2023, is assisting Devon and Cornwall Police’s subject 
access request compliance. This is evidenced by the November 2023 
subject access request statistics showing a reduction in the age of subject 
access requests awaiting completion. 
 
On 24 February 2023 The Alliance to which Devon and Cornwall Police 
belong to provided a comprehensive action plan detailing how they plan 
to bring Devon and Cornwall Police’s subject access request compliance 
back in line with Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, 
Section 54 of the DPA 2018. This action plan included details regarding 
recruiting and time scales. Further updated action plans were provided 
during the course of the investigation. 
 
Remedial steps taken by Devon and Cornwall Police 
 
1.5 The Commissioner has also considered and welcomes the remedial 
steps taken by Devon and Cornwall Police in light of this matter. In 
particular: 
 

•  Increased staffing levels – As of 3 July 2023 the Alliance to 

which Devon and Cornwall Police belong to have increased the pool 
of staff available to both forces by eight full time data protection 
advisors working 37 hours per week and two Advisors working 30 
hours per week. 
 

•  Implemented overtime - Along with increasing staffing levels the 

Alliance to which Devon and Cornwall Police belong to have also 

 

3 

been able to secure funding on a month by month basis to 
implement overtime for data protection staff. 
 

Decision to issue a reprimand 
 
1.6 Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, including the 
mitigating factors and remedial steps, the Commissioner has decided to 
issue a reprimand to Devon and Cornwall Police in relation to the 
infringements of Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, 
Section 54 of the DPA 2018 set out above. 
 
1.7 Devon and Cornwall Police were invited to provide representations. 
Devon and Cornwall Police did not wish to make any representations. 
 
Further Action Recommended 
 
1.8 The Commissioner recommends that Devon and Cornwall Police 
should take certain steps to ensure its compliance with the UK GDPR and 
the DPA 2018: 
 

1.  In order to ensure compliance with Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR 

and Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of the DPA 2018 Devon and 
Cornwall Police should continue to ensure that it has adequate staff 
resources in place to process and respond to subject access 
requests;  
 

2.  Devon and Cornwall Police should ensure they continue to take the 

steps outlined in their action plan to ensure that subject access 
requests are responded to within statutory deadlines in line with 
Article 12(3) of the UK GDPR and Part 3, Chapter 3, Section 54 of 
the DPA 2018.
