8.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

calls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes 

on those lines. The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited 

("TPS") is a limited 

company which operates 

the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry 

out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to the TPS for a fee 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This definition 

also 

applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a living individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such  individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. Section SSA 

of the DPA (as applied to 

PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended)  states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty  if 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that -

(a) there has been a serious 

contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC 

Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 by the person, 

4 

(b) subsection 

(2) or (3) applies. 

(2) This subsection 

applies 

if the contravention 

was deliberate. 

(3) This subsection 

applies 

if the person 

-

(a) knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that 

the contravention 

would occur, but 

(b) failed to take reasonable steps to 

prevent the 

contravention. 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

that has been 
of monetary  penalties 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties)  (Maximum 

Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty 

determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed  £500,000. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret PECR 

in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58( 1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

Background 

to the case 

16. MCP was incorporated 

on 24 April 2020 and 

is 
the registered 

office 

listed  as 

20-22 Wenlock Road, London, England, 

Nl 7GU. There is one 

director 

currently 

appointed, 

James  Miller.  However, 

from the start of 

5 

the investigation 

until 23 September 

2022, the listed director 

was Craig 

Peter Power ("Power"). 

17. On 23 September 

2022, a termination 

of appointment 

of Power as 

director 

of MCP was filed electronically 

but backdated 

to 4 January 

2021, and a cessation 

was 
of Power as a person with significant 

control 

filed electronically 

but backdated 

to 26 January 2021. Section 167 of 

the Companies 

Act 2006 states that Companies 

House should legally 

be 

notified 

within 14 days of a termination 

of director. 

18. The nature of the business 

undertaken 

by MCP is listed on Companies 

House as "retail 

sale of mobile telephones''. 

MCP is not registered 

as a 

data controller 

with the ICO, but Power is; his ·sector 

is listed as 

"marketing 

provider" 

and his nature of work as "lead generator". 

19. MCP came to the ICO's attention 

following 

a review of complaints 

made 

to the TPS in November 2021, in relation 

to unsolicited 

pension calls. 

The  telephone 

number "02921690260" 

was identified 

used to 
as  being 

make an unsolicited 

marketing 

call regarding 

pensions. 

The company 

name given was 'The Review Team" and the overview 

of the call was: 

"Finance/Pension. 

Despite  explaining 

the day before that I was 

on the TPS register 

and that I did not want to receive 

unsolicited 

calls, 

I was called again the following 

day. The 

caller 

was unapologetic 

and didn't have a clue what the TPS 

register 

is. I told them not to call me and he continued 

to try 

to talk to me. I made sure to take more details 

about the 

company on this occasion." 

20. On 17 January 2022, the Commissioner 

issued a third party 

information 

notice to the communications 

service 

provider 

("CSP"),

to the subscriber 

in respect of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers  kept 

by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with Regulation 

26, contrary 

to Regulation 

21( l)(b) of 

PECR. This resulted 

in five complaints 

being made to the TPS and  the 

Commissioner. 

53. 

The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of Regulation 21 

that these 20,939 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

15 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the purposes 

of Regulation 

21(4) had 

not notified 

MCP that they did not object to receiving 

such calls. 

54. For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21(4), the individual 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification  should 

reflect 

the individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

55. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications generally,  unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

56. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive  marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions. 

57. Further, 

MCP failed, 

as required 

by Regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

of the calls with the particulars 

specified 

at Regulation 

24(2) of PECR. 

58. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

16 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

59. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because there have been multiple 

breaches 

of Regulations 

21 and 24 by MCP arising 

from the organisation's 

activities 

between 1 January 2022 and 28 September 

2022, and this 

led to 20,939 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made 

to 

subscribers 

who were registered 

with the TPS and who had not notified 

MCP that they were willing 

to receive 

such calls, 

being 
five complaints 

made as a result. 

60. Furthermore, 

the complaints 

evidence 

indicated 

were 
that callers 

unable to satisfactorily 
explain 

where subscriber 

data was obtained 

from, that MCP appeared to display 

a wilful 

disregard 

for TPS or CTPS 

registration 

status, 

and at times even became abusive to the 

complainants. 

In addition, the marketing activity 

of MCP includes 

sectors 

where unsolicited 

activity 

can cause financial 

harm and affect 

vulnerable 

individuals. 

61. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

62. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

MCP's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions 

( even if MCP did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

17 

63. The Commissioner considers 

that in this case MCP did deliberately 

contravene 

Regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR. MCP appears to have taken 

deliberate 

steps to try to mask its activity 

and, despite 

the 

Commissioner's investigation 

involving 

several 

attempts 

to contact 

MCP, there has been no response 

or cooperation 

and unsolicited 

marketing  activity 

has continued 

even after the initial 

investigation 

letter was sent. 

64. For the above reasons, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this breach 

was deliberate. 

65. Further 

and in the alternative, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to 

consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above  was 

negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two elements: 

66. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether MCP knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known  that  there 

was a risk  that 

this contravention 

would occur. 

He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met, as any company conducting 

direct marketing 

calls should take appropriate 

and necessary 

steps to 

comply with the regulations. 

The guidance 

on the 
available 

Commissioner's website 

is clear that companies 

must not make calls to 

TPS or CTPS registered 

numbers without receiving 

prior notification 

that subscribers 

do not object to the calls. 

The requirements 

for 

sending  unsolicited 

direct marketing 

messages  are 

also clearly 

set out 

on the Commissioner's 

website. 

67. Furthermore, 

the Commissioner 

has previously 

issued a monetary 

penalty 

for breaches 

of PECR to Help Direct UK Limited, 

with whom 

Power was involved.  Power 

was therefore 

aware of the remit of the 

Commissioner 

and the existence 

of PECR, prior to conducting 

18 

unsolicited 

marketing 

activity. 

68. The Commissioner 

has also published 

detailed 

guidance 

for companies 

carrying 

out marketing  explaining 

their legal requirements 

under PECR. 

This guidance  explains 

the circumstances 

under which organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the phone, by text, by email, by 

post or by fax. Specifically, 

it states that live calls must not be made to 

any subscriber 

registered 

with the TPS, unless the subscriber 

has 

specifically 

notified 

the company that they do not object to receiving 

such calls. 

In case organisations 

remain unclear on their obligations, 

the ICO operates 

a telephone 

helpline. 

ICO communications 

about 

previous 

enforcement 

action where businesses  have 

with 
not complied 

PECR are also readily 

available. 

69. It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that MCP should have been aware 

in this area. 
of its responsibilities 

70. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether MCP 

failed to take reasonable

is met. 
that this condition 

71. Reasonable 

steps in these circumstances 

may also have included 

ensuring 

that data was screened 

against 

the TPS and CTPS, or that 

appropriate 

notifications 

had been received 

prior to 
from subscribers 

calling 

them. MCP has provided 

no evidence 

to demonstrate 

that 

personal 

data was sourced in a compliant 

manner, nor have any 

training 

materials, 

policies 

or procedures 

to demonstrate 

an attempt to 

comply with PECR been provided. 

The complete 

lack of engagement 

with the Commissioner's 

investigation 

is indicative 

of an absence of any 

reasonable 

steps taken to try to prevent the contravention. 

19 

72. Given the volume of calls and the fact of resultant 

complaints, 

it is 

clear that MCP failed to take those reasonable 

steps. 

73. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue a monetary penalty 

74. The Commissioner 

has taken into  account  the 

following 

aggravating 

features 

of this case: 

•  MCP has not engaged with the Commissioner's 

investigation 

despite multiple  attempts 

to establish 

contact. 

•  MCP appears to have taken steps to deliberately 
address being a mail drop address, 

mask its activity 

with its registered

•  The termination 

of appointment 

for Power as a director 
at MCP 

was filed on 23 September 
2022, contrary 
Power was not the director 
the Commissioner 

considers 

to the Companies 

2022 but was backdated 

to 4 January 

Act and making it appear that 
which 

for the contravention 

period, 

was not the case. 

•  MCP failed 

to file accounts 

and instead 

set up under the slightly 

name of MCP Online Group Limited which may be an 

different 
attempt to phoenix 

and/or evade regulatory 

action. 

20 

•  In addition 

to the contraventions 

of Regulation 

21, there has also 

been a serious 

breach of Regulation 

22, as 92,265 text messages 

were delivered 

by MCP generating 

386 SPAM text complaints. 

75. The Commissioner 

has not identified 

any mitigating 

features 

in this 

case. 

76. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

been 
55B have 

complied 

with. 

77. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

dated 6 July 

2023 in which the Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

However, no representations 

were made by MCP in response 

to that 

Notice. 

78. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

79. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his  discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

80. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote  compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards  compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently  engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity 

21 

to reinforce  the 

need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning 

consumers 

who are not registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically 

indicate 

that they do not object to receiving 

these calls 

81. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance;  the likely impact 

of 

the proposed intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely 

impact of the 

proposed intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

82. For these  reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

83. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £55,000 (fifty five thousand pounds) 

is reasonable 

and proportionate 

given the particular 

facts of the case 

and the underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

the penalty. 

Conclusion 

office by 
84. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 

BACS transfer 

or cheque  by 

1 November 2023 at the latest.  The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner  but 

will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's  general  bank 

account 

at the Bank of England. 

22 

85. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

31 October 2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary penalty 

by 20% to £44,000 (forty four thousand pounds). However, 

you 

should be aware that the early payment discount 

is not available 

if you 

decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

86. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal 

(Information 

Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

87. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

88. Information 

about appeals is set out in Annex 1. 

89. The Commissioner 

will not take action to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

•  the period specified 

within the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

•  all relevant 

appeals against 

the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn; 

and 

•  the period for appealing 
of it has expired.

the monetary penalty and

23 

90. In England, 

Wales and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty 

is 

recoverable 

by Order of the County Court or the High Court. In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as 

an extract 

registered 

decree arbitral 

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff court of any sheriffdom 

in Scotland.
