Skean first came to the attention of the Commissioner in 2022 as part of an operation formed to assess and analyse complaint trends in relation to the energy and home improvement sector. The Commissioner identified a number of complaints against "Eco Hub", "Driveway Solutions" and "Eco Driveways", in which complainants stated that the calls were promoting energy grants for resin driveways.
The investigation established that between 2 March 2022 and 31 May 2022, Skean instigated 614,342 unsolicited direct marketing calls in breach of regulations 21 and 24 of PECR.
The above resulted in 31 complaints to the ICO and TPS reporting tools.
