2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract  with 

a provider 

of public electronic

 

communications  services 

for the supply of such services". 

11. The DPA contains 

enforcement 

provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

and 
Those provisions are 

modified 

extended for the purposes 

of PECR  by Schedule 

1 PECR. 

12. Section  40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) 

provides  that 

if the Commissioner

Enforcement 

Notice requiring

Office 

16. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

17. Between 1 January 2021 and 30 June  2021, 

SGS used or instigated 

the 

use of a public telecommunications 

service 

for the  purposes 

of making 

24,241 unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of the called 

line was a number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the 

Commissioner 

in accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. This resulted 

in one complaint 

being made to the 

Commissioner. 

18. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 24,241 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were  made 

to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with  the 

TPS at  least 

28 days prior  to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for  the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21( 4) had 

not notified 

SGS that  they  did  not 

object to receiving 

such calls. 

19. For such notification 

to be valid under regulation  21(4), 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

the individual 
their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive  marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up  to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

20. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

s 

21. Further, the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness

 

to receive marketing 

calls from that company specifically.

will not be valid for the purposes  of
