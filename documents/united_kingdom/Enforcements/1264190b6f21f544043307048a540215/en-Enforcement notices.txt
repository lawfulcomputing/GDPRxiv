The Telephone

register 

on the  Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who  wish

by telephone  can  subscribe 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that 

register.

of any  advertising 

material

individuals". 

This definition 

also applies for the

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract

of public electronic

11. The DPA contains 

enforcement 

provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

Those provisions 

are modified 

and 

extended 

for the purposes 

of PECR by Schedule 

1 PECR. 

12. Section 40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) 

provides 

that if the Commissioner is 

satisfied 

that a person has 

contravened 

or is contravening

he may serve him with an Enforcement

The contravention 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

15. The Commissioner 

finds that HHA247L contravened 

regulation 

21 of 

PECR. 

16. The Commissioner finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

17. Between 1 June 2021 to 30 November 2021, HHA247L used a public 

telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 19,069 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the 

number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect 

of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

kept by the Commissioner 

in accordance

 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. This 

resulted 

in two complaints 

being made to the TPS  and  the

 

Commissioner.

 

18. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 19,069 unsolicited 

were made to 
direct marketing calls 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the  purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not  notified  HHA247L 

that they did not object to receiving 

such calls. 

19. For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21( 4 ), the individual 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's

 

choice about  whether 

or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

 
up to use a product or service  is 

conditional

upon receiving  marketing  calls,  companies 

will need to demonstrate

 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's

 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

5 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

20. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individu

als opting in to marketing 

communications 

generall

y, unless it 

is clear that  this 

will include 

telephone 

calls. 

21. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes  of  regulation 

21( 4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptio

ns. 

22. HHA247L did not assert nor present any evidence 

to the effect that any 

of the subscribers 

whose numbers were registered 

on the TPS had 

informed 

them for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) that they did not, 

for the time being, object to such 

calls being made to those numbers. 

23. 

The Commissioner 

has considered, 

as he is required 

to do under 

section 

40(2) of the DPA (as extended 

and modified 

by PECR) when 

deciding  whether 

to serve an Enforcement 

Notice, 

whether  any 

contravention 

has caused or is likely to cause any person damage. The 

Commissioner 

has decided that it is unlikely that 

damage has been 

caused in this instance. 

24. In view of the matters referred 

to above the Commissioner 

hereby 

gives notice that, in exercise 

of his powers under section 

40 of the 

DPA, he requires 

HHA24 7L to take the steps 

specified 

in Annex 1 of 

this Notice.
