8. Under regulation 

26  of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified 

them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

calls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes on 

those lines. The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited 

("TPS") is a limited 

company which operates 

the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry 

out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to the TPS for a fee 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines  direct  marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of any advertising  material  which 

is directed 

This definition 
to particular  individuals". 

also applies 

for the 

purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a living individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. The DPA contains 

enforcement 

provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

Those provisions 

are modified 

and 

extended for the purposes 

of PECR by Schedule 

1 PECR. 

13. Section 40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) 

provides 

that if the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that a person has 

4 

ICO.

Commissioner's 

Office 

contravened 

or is contravening 

any of the requirements of the 

Regulations, 

he may serve him with an Enforcement 

Notice requiring 

him to take within such time as may be specified 

in the Notice, 
or to 

refrain 

from taking after such time as may be so specified, 

such steps 

as are so specified. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic 

communications 

sector.  PECR 

were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

for individuals' 

privacy 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for  the 

purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

The contravention 

16.  The Commissioner 

finds that RHAP contravened 

21 and 24 
Regulations 

of PECR. 

17. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

18. Between 1 January 2021 and 31 August 2021, RHAP used a public 

telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 15,288 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the 

number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect 

of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation  21(1)(b) 

of PECR. 

This resulted 

in four complaints being 

made to the TPS and the 

5 

Commissioner. 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

19.  The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 15,288 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with  the  TPS 

at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not notified  RHAP 

that they did  not 

 
object to receiving 

such calls.

20.  For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21( 4 ), the individual

 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

calls 
marketing 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect the 

individual's

 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing  calls.

 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional

 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate

 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's

 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls.

 

21.  The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing  communications  generally,  unless  it

 

is clear that this will include  telephone 

calls.

 

22.  Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness

 

to receive 

marketing calls from 

that company specifically. 

Notifications

 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations",

 

"partners", 

"selected  third 
parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions.

 

23.  The Commissioner 

has considered 

the lack of evidence of 

any 

notifications 

obtained 

by RHAP and is concerned 

that 15,288 calls were 

made to subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days 

6 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

prior to receiving 

the calls, 

and who in each case for the purposes  of 

Regulation 

21 ( 4) had not notified 

RHAP that they did not object to 

receiving 

such calls. 

24. It is the Commissioner's 

view that RHAP provided 

limited 

that 
evidence 

call recipients 

listed on the TPS had provided 

their consent to receive 

calls from RHAP. On two call recordings 

provided 

by RHAP, one of its 

agents names a third party,  "APUK" 

or "Appliance 

Plan UK" as gaining 

permission 

on behalf of RHAP for the call. RHAP has not provided 

any 

evidence 

to demonstrate 

how APUK or Appliance 

Plan UK gained 

consent for RHAP to make the call. Further, 

RHAP has not provided 

any 

evidence 

that  would 

demonstrate 

to the Commissioner 

how RHAP or 

any  third  party 

are notified 

by call recipients 

listed on the TPS that they 

do not, for the time being, object to calls from RHAP. 

25. Further,  RHAP 

failed, 

as required 

by Regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

of the calls  with 

the particulars 

specified 

at Regulation 

24(2) of PECR. 

26. The Commissioner 

has considered, 

as he is required 

to do under 

section 

40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) when 

deciding 

whether to serve an Enforcement Notice, 

whether any 

contravention 

has caused or is likely 

to cause any person damage. The 

Commissioner 

has decided that it is likely 

that damage has been 

caused in this instance. 

The content of the complaints 

indicates 

that 

the individuals 

felt distressed 

by the calls. 

27. In view of the matters referred 

to above the Commissioner 

hereby 

gives notice that, in exercise 

of his powers under section 

40 of the 

DPA, he requires 

RHAP to take the steps specified 

in Annex 1 of this 

Notice.
