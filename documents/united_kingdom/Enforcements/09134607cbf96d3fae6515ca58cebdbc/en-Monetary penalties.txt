("the GDPR"): regulation 

8(2) of the Data Protection,

definition: 

"'consent' 

of the data subject means any freely given, specific,

indication 

of the data subject's 

wishes by 

which he or she, by a statement 

or by a clear affirmative

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy in the electronic

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the 

purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18:  see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18.

by the 7726 spam reporting

any evidence 

held to show that the subscribers

to receiving  unsolicited 

direct

14 

61. The Commissioner 

has made the above  findings 

of fact  on the 

balance of probabilities. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

62. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those  facts 

constitute 

a contravention 

of regulation 

22  of PECR by SCL and, if so, whether the 

conditions 

of section 

SSA DPA are satisfied. 

The contravention 

63. The Commissioner 

finds that SCL contravened 

regulation 

22  of PECR. 

64. The Commissioner 

finds that the 

contravention 

was as follows: 

65. The Commissioner 

finds that between 9 December 2020 and 9  March 

2022 there were 441,830 direct marketing SMS 

messages received 

by 

subscribers. 

The Commissioner 

finds that SCL transmitted 

or instigated 

the transmission 

of those direct marketing 

messages, 

contrary 

to 

regulation 

22  of PECR. 

66. SCL, as the sender or instigator 

of the direct marketing, 

is required 

to 

ensure that it is acting in compliance 

with  the 

requirements  of 

regulation 

22  of PECR, and to ensure that valid consent to send those 

messages had been acquired. 

67. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

says "organisations 

need to be aware that indirect 

consent will not be enough for texts, 

emails or automated 

calls. 

This is because the rules on electronic 

marketing 

are stricter, 

to reflect the more intrusive 

nature of electronic 

messages." 

15 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

68. However, it does go  on  to 

say that indirect 

consent may be valid, but 

only if it is clear and specific 

enough. If categories 

of organisations 

are 

referred 

to then those categories 

must be tightly 

defined and the 

organisation 

wanting to use the consent  must 

clearly 

fall  within  the 

description. 

Consent is  not likely  to 

be valid where an individual 

is 

presented 

with a  long, 

seemingly 

exhaustive 

list of categories 

of 

organisations. 

69. For consent to be valid it is required 

to be "freely 

given", 

by which it 

follows 

that if consent to marketing 

is  a condition 

of subscribing 

to a 

service, 

the organisation 

will have to demonstrate 

how the consent can 

be said to have  been 

given freely. 

70. Consent is  also 

required 

to be "specific" 

as  to the type of marketing 

communication 

to be received, 

and the organisation, 

type of 
or specific 

organisation, 

that will be sending it. 

71. Consent will not be "informed" 

if individuals 

do not understand 

what 

they are consenting 

to. Organisations 

should  therefore  always  ensure 

that the language used is clear, easy to understand, 

and not hidden 

away in  a privacy  policy 

or small  print.  Consent  will 

not be valid if 

individuals 

are asked to agree to receive marketing 

from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic description. 

72. The Commissioner 

has considered 

the evidence 

provided 

by SCL who 

asserted 

that it purchased 

data relating 

to  individuals 

who had recently 

applied 

for loans and who had consented 

to receiving 

SMS, email 

and/or telephone 

communications 

about third party products 

or 

services. 

However, it failed to provide any evidence 

that the individuals 

16 

who received 

the messages had provided 

valid consent for SMS 

messages sent by or at the instigation 
of SCL. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

73. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

from the evidence 

he has seen 

that SCL did not have the necessary 

valid consent for the 441,830 

direct marketing 

messages received 

by subscribers. 

74. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

75. The Commissioner 

is satisfied that 

the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because between 9 December 2020 and 9 

March 2022 a confirmed 

total of 441,830 direct marketing 

messages 

were sent by or at the instigation 

of SCL. These messages contained 

direct marketing 

material 

for which subscribers 

had not provided 

valid 

consent. 

The messages resulted 

in 3,959 complaints 

to the 7726 spam 

reporting 

service 

and six complaints 

to the Commissioner. 

76. In addition, 

SCL also sent or instigated 

the sending of a further 

368,465 marketing 

messages. 

Although 

these were not received 

by 

individuals, 

it may indicate 

an attempt to send  large 

volumes of 

marketing 

messages to individuals 

without consent to do so. 

77. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA(l) DPA is met. 

17 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

78. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

SCL's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions (even if SCL did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

79. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that SCL deliberately 

set out to 

contravene 

PECR in this instance. 

80. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent. 

This consideration  comprises 

two 

elements: 

81. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether SCL knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a risk that these contraventions 

would 

occur. He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met, given that SCL relied 

entirely 

on direct marketing 

due to the nature of its business, 

it should 

reasonably 

have sought to familiarise 

itself 

with the relevant 

legislation. 

The director, 

Mr Flannery, 

has worked in the direct 

marketing 

industry 

since 2010 and one of his previous 

companies 

was 

investigated 

by the Commissioner 

in 2015 for sending unsolicited 

SMS 

messages in contravention 

of PECR. In response 

to that investigation, 

he provided 

assurances 

that he would no longer rely on generic third 

party consent. 

82. The Commissioner 

has published 

detailed 

guidance 

for those carrying 

out direct marketing 

explaining 

their legal obligations 

under PECR. 

This guidance 

gives clear advice regarding 

the requirements 

of consent 

for direct marketing 

and explains 

the circumstances 

under which 

18 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the phone, by text, 

by email, by post, or by fax. In particular 

it states that organisations 

can generally 

only send, or instigate, 

marketing 

messages to 

individuals 

if that person has specifically 

consented 

to receiving 

them. 

The Commissioner 

has also published 

detailed 

guidance 

on consent 

under the GDPR. In case organisations 

remain unclear on their 

obligations, 

the ICO operates 

a telephone 

helpline. 

ICO 

communications 

about previous 

enforcement 

action where businesses 

have not complied 

with PECR are also readily 

available. 

83. It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that SCL should have been aware 

in this area. 
of its responsibilities 

84. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether SCL 

failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the contraventions. 

Again, he 

is satisfied 

is met. 
that this condition 

85. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

makes clear that 

organisations 

acquiring 

or utilising 

marketing 

lists from a third party 

must undertake 

rigorous 

checks to satisfy themselves 

that the personal 

data was obtained 

fairly 

and lawfully, 

and that they have the necessary 

consent. 

It is not acceptable 

to rely on assurances 

given by third party 

suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper due diligence. 

86. The Commissioner 

would have expected 

SCL to have sought advice 

either from the Commissioner 

or from an independent 

legal advisor in 

relation 

direct 
to the basis on which it proposed to send its unsolicited 

marketing 

but failed to do so. SCL should also have conducted 

proportionate 

due diligence 

on the data being relied upon, including 

asking its third party data providers 

for evidence 

of the valid consent 

19 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

received 

and entering 

into appropriate, 

written 

agreements 

with the 

third party. 

87. In the circumstances, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that SCL failed to 

take reasonable 

steps to prevent the contraventions. 

88. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied that 

condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue  a monetary penalty 

89. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that there are any aggravating 

features 

or mitigating 

features 

in this case. 

90. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

is satisfied that the 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

91. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a  Notice 

of Intent, 

in which the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking 

and invited 

SCL to make 

representations. 

In accordance 

with the requirements 

65 of 
of section 

the DPA, the Notice of Intent was served on the registered 

office of 

SCL.  The 

Commissioner 

believes 

that SCL may no longer be operating 

from that address and that Mr Flannery 

has failed to inform Companies 

House. The Notice of Intent was also sent to the email address used by 

Mr Flannery 

in his communications 

with the ICO in the course of the 

investigation. 

Despite this, no representations 

were received 

from SCL 

in response 

to the Notice of Intent. 

20 

92. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

93. The Commissioner 

has considered whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

94. The Commissioner 

has attempted 

to consider 

the likely 

impact of a 

monetary penalty on SCL but has been unable to  do  so 

given the lack 

of recent publicly 

available 

information. 

SCL was invited 

to provide 

financial 

representations 

in response 

to the Notice of Intent, 

but failed 

to do so. The Commissioner 

considers 

in the circumstances 

that a 

penalty remains the appropriate 

course of action. 

95. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The sending of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
messages is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance with 

the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging in these practices. 

The issuing 

of a 

monetary penalty will reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that 

they are only messaging 

those who specifically 

consent to receive 

direct marketing. 

96. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely impact of 

the proposed 

intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely impact of the 

21 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

proposed 

intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

97. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

98. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £40,000.00 

(forty  thousand 

pounds) is 

reasonable 

and proportionate 

given the particular 

facts of the case and 

the  underlying  objective 

in imposing 

the penalty.

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner

104. The Commissioner 

will not take  action 

to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

• the period specified 

within the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid  has 

expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

• all relevant 

appeals against the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn;

variation 

of it has expired.
