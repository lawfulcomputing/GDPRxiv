Of: 3 Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 8YZ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) issues a reprimand to The 
 
Electoral Commission in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the UK General 
Data Protection Regulation in respect of certain infringements of the UK GDPR. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Summary of  Incident 

 

 

1.1 The Electoral Commission is the independent body which oversees elections 
 
and regulates political finance in the UK. They also work to promote public 
 
confidence in the democratic process and ensure its integrity.

Register, which contains the names and home addresses for approximately 
 
40,000,000 data subjects.

2. Cluster  1 

 

 

 

2.1 On 24 August 2021, an unknown Threat Actor gained access to an on-
premise Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 via the ProxyShell vulnerability chain. 
 
The vulnerability chain consisted of the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-
31207, CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-34473. A user account was 
impersonated during the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, which led to web 
 
shells being created on the system.

chain was utilised  on several  occasions during this  incident  and  the  patches1 for 
these  vulnerabilities  were  released in  April  and  May  2021. 

6.2  Furthermore,  a  report produced  during this incident  highlighted a further 
eight vulnerabilities  which  were  also  present  on the servers.  Although  not 
utilised on  this  occasion,  any one  of  them  could have  been exploited  by  a 
Threat  Actor whilst they  existed on  the relevant  systems. 

6.3  The  NCSC2 and  NIST3 have  both  produced  extensive  guidance  on  patching 
which  highlight the importance of having  an  appropriate  patching  plan  in place 
as  well as  the  actions organisations  can take. 

6.4  This  failing  is  a basic measure  that  we would expect  to  see implemented in 
any  organisation  processing  personal data  - regardless  of  potential  severity  of 
risk  or  size  of  organisation. 

7. Article 32 (1)  (b) 

•  The  Electoral  Commission  were  not ensuring the ongoing confidentiality  of 

its processing  systems  as  per  Article  32(1)(b). 

7 .1  The  Electoral  Commission did  not  have appropriate  password management 
policies in place at the  time of  the incident. During  the  Electoral  Commission's 
investigation,  they  discovered  that  one  of the compromised accounts  was  still 
using  a  password  which  was  allocated to  the  account  upon  creation.  Following 
this,

7 .2 
passwords identical  or  similar  to the ones provided  to users  by  the  Service  Desk 
upon account  creation or password reset.  An  additional 33 deactivated accounts 
with  similar  password  were  also found. Following  their audit, 
stated  that  this  practice  of  reusing passwords  makes The  Electoral 
Commission's passwords  highly susceptible  to  password guessing. 

7 .3  The  Electoral  Commission  did  not  have  a dedicated  password  management 
policy  in  place  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  The  policy  (Acceptable  Use)  which 
was  in  place  did  not  contain  any  specific  password  management  guidance,  the  only 
reference  to  passwords stated 'do not reveal or write  down  passwords'. 

7.4  The  NCSC4 and NIST5 have produced  guidance  on passwords  which

mitigations  like rate  limiting. 

7 .5  This  failing  is  a  basic  measure  that  we  would expect  to  see implemented in 
any  organisation  processing personal data  - regardless  of  potential  severity  of 
risk  or  size  of  organisation. 

8. Remedial steps taken  by The  Electoral Commission

9. Decision to issue a reprimand 

9.1  Taking  into account  the  circumstances of  this case,  including the  remedial 
steps,  the  Commissioner  has  decided  to  issue  a  reprimand  to  The  Electoral 
Commission in  relation to the  infringements of Articles  S(l)(f) and 32(1)(b) of
