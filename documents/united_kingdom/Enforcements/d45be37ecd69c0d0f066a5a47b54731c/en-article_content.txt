A reprimand is being issued to Dover Harbour Board in respect of the creation and use of a social media distribution group, initially created in WhatsApp but later migrated to Telegram. From the evidence provided to the ICO, the distribution groups were used by multiple UK police forces and international law enforcement agencies for the purpose of combatting vehicle crime. The distribution groups were created by an officer from the Port of Dover Police using his personal mobile phone without organisational oversight or compliance with data protection legislation.
