Reprimand issued to Birmingham Children’s Trust Community Interest company in respect of Article 5(1)(f) and 32(1)(b) and 2. A child protection plan containing inappropriate personal data, in the form of criminal allegations against a child, was sent to the family the plan was produced for. Although the care plan itself was authorised for the family to view, the criminal allegations were not relevant to the plan, or authorised for the family’s view. The investigation highlighted that appropriate technical and organisational measures were not in place at the time of the breach.
