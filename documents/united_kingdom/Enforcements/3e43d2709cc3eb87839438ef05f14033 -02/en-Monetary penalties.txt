for the purposes 

of 

direct marketing 

by means of  electronic

(a) where the identity 

of the person on whose behalf the 

communication 

has been sent has been disguised 

or 

concealed; 

(b) where a valid address to which the recipient 

of the

which contravene 

that regulation." 

6.  Section 122(5) of the Data Protection 

Act 2018 "DPA18" defines 

direct 

marketing 

as "the communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This 

definition 

also applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation

PECR and paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) to Schedule 

19 of the DPA18). 

7.  From 1 January 2021, consent in PECR has been defined by reference 

to the concept of consent in the UK GDPR as defined in section

Article 

Information 
4(11) of the UK GDPR sets out the following 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Office 

definition: 

"'consent' 

of the data subject 

means any freely given, 

specific, 

informed 

and unambiguous 

indication 

of the data subject's 

wishes by which he or she, by a statement 

or by a clear affirmative 

action, 

signifies 

agreement 

to the processing 

of personal 

data relating 

to him or her''. 

8.  Recital 

32 of the UK GDPR materially 

states that "When the processing 

has multiple 

purposes, 

consent should be given for all of them". Recital 

42 materially 

provides 

that "For consent to be informed, 

the data subject 

should be aware at least of the identity 

of the controller". 

Recital

materially 

states that "Consent

9.  "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a living 

individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

10. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

11. "Electronic

voice, sound or image message sent over a public electronic 

communications 

network which can be stored in the network or in the 

recipient's 

terminal 

equipment  until 

it is collected 

by the recipient 

and 

includes 

messages sent using a short message service". 

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended)  states:

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty if 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 
that -

(a) there has been a  serious 

contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC 

Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 by the person, 

(b) subsection 

(2) or (3) applies. 

(2) This subsection 

applies 

if the contravention 

was deliberate. 

(3) This subsection 

applies 

if the person 

-

(a) knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that the 

contravention 

would occur, but 

(b) failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the 

contravention." 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties) 

(Maximum Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed fS00,000. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's  fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner  will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights.

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

Background 

to the case 

16. Mobile users 

can report the receipt 

of unsolicited marketing text 

messages to the Mobile UK's Spam Reporting Service 

by forwarding 

the 

message to 7726 (spelling 

out "SPAM"). 

Mobile UK is an organisation 

that represents 

the interests 

of mobile operators 

in the UK. The 

Commissioner 

is provided 

with access to the data on complaints 

made 

to the 7726 service. 

17. LADH is a company in the financial  services 

sector. 

The exact nature of 

LADH's business 

is unclear 

due to its limited 

online presence. 

However, 

from the publicly 

available 

information 

on Companies 

House, LADH's 

business 

is stated as "Life Insurance" 

and in LADH's lapsed ICO 

registration, 

the nature of LADH's work is stated as "Independent 

Financial 

Adviser". 

The sole director 

of LADH is Mr Stuart Pearson (the 

"LADH Director") 

who is also listed 

on Companies 

House as LADH's 

person of significant 

control. 

18. LADH came to the attention 

of the Commissioner 

as part of a wider 

operation 

that focused on organisations 

direct 
sending unsolicited 

marketing 

messages promoting 

debt advice and debt management 

solutions. 

As part of this operation, 

was used to 

identify 

SMS complaints 

submitted 

to the 7726 service. 
ThisÂ­

identified 

48 complaints 

regarding 

SMS messages sent from the 

following 

number: +447520649718 

(the "Relevant 

Number"). 
Two 

examples of the SMS messages sent are as follows:

19. 

identified 

a further 

58 complaints 

that were received 

in relation 

to 

these SMS messages, 

but which did not identify 

the Relevant  Number 

as the sender. As a result 

the Commissioner 

identified 

a total of 106 complaints 

that were received 

by the 7726 

service. 

20. On 17 May 2022, the Commissioner 

sent a third party information 

notice to 

(the "Communications 

Service 

Provider" 

(CSP)) to 

which the Relevant 

Number was allocated. 

This notice requested the 

CSP to provide, amongst other 

things, 

information 

relating 

to: 

â¢  the identity 

and contact 

details 

of the subscriber 

to the Relevant 

Number; 

â¢  the total number of SMS messages sent by the subscriber 

during 

the periods 

of connection  including 

the number of these SMS 

messages that were successfully 

delivered; 

â¢  copies of message logs showing all SMS messages sent by the 

subscriber  since 

1 January  2022. 

7 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

21. The CSP responded 

to the Commissioner's notice 

on 14 June 2022 and 

confirmed 

the subscriber 

was LADH. The CSP also provided 

the 

message logs which showed that during the period between 14 March 

2022 and 30 April 2022 (the "Contravention 

Period"), 

LADH sent a total 

of 49,938 SMS marketing 

messages, 

of which 31,329 messages were 

delivered. 

The complaints 

sent to the 7726 service 

were cross-checked 

against (and matched) the message logs provided 

by the CSP. 

22. On 15 July 2022, the Commissioner 

sent an initial 

investigation 

letter 

to LADH by email (the "Initial 

Investigation 

Letter") 

which attached 

a 

spreadsheet 

of the 106 complaints 

and, 
sent to the 7726 service 

amongst other things, 

requested 

LADH to provide information 

on: 

â¢  the source of data used to promote LADH's business; 

â¢  for each source of data, how LADH ensured that individuals 

had 

consented 

to receiving 

SMS messages from LADH; 

â¢  evidence 

that subscribers 

to the relevant 

mobile numbers had 

consented 

to receiving 

unsolicited 

direct  marketing  messages  from 

LADH; 

â¢  any contracts 

with third parties 

from which information 

was 

purchased 

by LADH including 

details 

of any due diligence 

undertaken. 

23. The LADH Director 

responded 

to the Initial 

Investigation 

Letter on the 

same day, stating 

that LADH "is no longer trading 

since 2021". In 

response, 

the Commissioner 

informed 

of the 
the LADH Director 

information 

received 

from the CSP which,  amongst 

other things, 

confirmed 

that 49,938 SMS messages were sent to individuals 

from a 

8 

mobile number allocated 

to LADH. In view of this and the fact that 

LADH remained active on Companies 

House, the Commissioner 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

informed 

the LADH Director 

that a response 

to the Initial 

Investigation 

Letter was still required. 

However, the Commissioner 

did not receive 

a 

response 

or acknowledgement 

from the LADH Director 

by the required 

deadline. 

24. On 9 August 2022, the Commissioner 

sent another email to the LADH 

Director 

attaching 

a copy of the Initial  Investigation 

Letter and 

requesting 

a response 

within seven days. The LADH Director 

responded 

on the same day and requested 

a call to discuss 

the matter. Following 

a series of exchanges 

between the Commissioner 

and the LADH 

Director, 

a call was finally 

held on 15 August 2022. During the call, the 

LADH Director confirmed, 

amongst other things, 

that: 

â¢  he was offered 

this opportunity 

in respect 

of an SMS campaign 

under investigation; 

â¢  he had been verbally 

reassured 

that he was receiving 

'opt-in 

data' 

and went ahead to send the SMS messages; 

â¢  he had not received 
data'.

25. The LADH  Director 

did not provide  the  Commissioner 

with any 

information 

on who offered him this opportunity 

or who provided 

him 

with the 'opt-in 

data'. The LADH Director 

reassured 

the Commissioner 

that he would respond to the queries in the Initial 

Investigation 

Letter 

by 19 August 2022. 

9 

26. On 16 August 2022, the Commissioner 

sent an email to the LADH 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 
Office 

Information 

Director 

providing 

additional 

time for the LADH Director 

to respond to 

the Initial 

Investigation 

Letter (i.e. a revised 

deadline 

of 22 August 

2022). The LADH Director 

thanked the Commissioner 

and stated that 

he would "have all the answers ... and any evidence". 

However, no 

further  response 

was provided  from 

the LADH Director 

after this 

communication. 

The Commissioner 

sent a further 

chaser on 31 August 

2022 and reminded the LADH Director 

set. 
of the deadline 

27. On 19 October 2022 (following 

an unsuccessful 

attempt on 15 

September 

2022 due to postal delivery 

issues), 

the Commissioner 

served a hand delivered 

Information 

Notice to LADH's registered 

address which requested 

a response 

to the queries in the Initial 

Investigation 

Letter by 23 November 2022 and reminded LADH that 

failure 

to respond to an Information 

Notice is a criminal 

offence. 

No 

response 

was received 

from LADH by the required 

deadline. 

The 

Commissioner 

did not receive 

any further 

contact or communication 

from the LADH Director. 

28. The Commissioner 

has made the above findings 

of fact on the 

balance of probabilities. 

29. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a contravention 

of regulations 

22 and 23 of PECR by LADH and, if so, 

whether the conditions 

of section 

SSA DPA are satisfied. 

The contravention 

30. The Commissioner 

finds that LADH contravened 

22 and 23 
regulations 

of PECR. 

31. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

10 

32. The Commissioner 

finds that between 14 March 2022 and 30 April 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

2022 there were 31,329 direct marketing 

SMS messages received 

by 

subscribers. 

The Commissioner  finds 

that LADH transmitted 

those 

direct marketing 

messages, 

contrary 

to regulation 

22 of PECR. 

33. LADH, as the sender of the direct marketing, 

is required 

to ensure that 

it is acting in compliance 

with the requirements 

of regulation 

22 of 

PECR, and to ensure that valid  consent 

to send those  messages 

had 

been acquired. 

34. In this instance 

LADH was required 

to demonstrate 

that valid consent 

had been obtained 

in order to enable it to send the direct marketing 

SMS messages described 

in paragraph 

18 above. 

35. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

says "organisations 

need to be aware that indirect 

consent will not be enough for texts, 

emails or automated 

calls. 

This is because the rules on electronic 

marketing 

are stricter, 

to reflect 

the more intrusive 

nature of electronic 

messages." 

36. However, it does go on to say that indirect 

consent may be valid, but 

only if it is clear and specific enough. 

If categories 

of organisations 

are 

referred 

to then those categories 

must be tightly 

defined and the 

organisation  wanting 

to use the consent must clearly 

fall within  the 

description. 

Consent is not likely 

to be valid where an individual 

is 

presented 

with a long, seemingly 

exhaustive 

list of categories 

of 

organisations. 

37. For consent to be valid it is required 

to be "freely 

given", 

by which it 

follows 

that if consent to marketing 

is a condition 

of subscribing 

to a 

11 

service, 

the organisation 

will have to demonstrate 

Information 
how the consent can 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Office 

be said to have been given freely. 

38. Consent is also required 

to be "specific" 

as to the type of marketing 

communication 

to be received, 

and the organisation, 

type of 
or specific 

organisation, 

that will be sending it. 

39. Consent will not be "informed" 

if individuals 

do not understand 

what 

they are consenting 

to. Organisations 

should therefore 

always ensure 

that the language 

used is clear, easy to understand, 

and not hidden 

away in a privacy 

policy or small print. Consent will not be valid if 

individuals 

are asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

from "similar 

organisations", "partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic description. 

40. LADH failed to provide any evidence 

that the SMS messages sent were 

solicited 

or that the recipients 

had notified 

LADH that they had 

consented 

for the time being to receive 

such SMS messages. 

In 

addition, 

based on the specific 

by the 
SMS messages submitted 

complainants, 

the Commissioner 

found that most of the SMS messages 

did not contain 

an opportunity 

for  individuals 

to opt out. 

41. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

from the evidence 

he has seen 

that LADH did not have the necessary 

valid consent for the 31,329 

direct marketing 

messages received 

by subscribers. 

42. The Commissioner 

is further 

satisfied 

that the actions 

of LADH have 

contravened 

regulation 

23 PECR given that the only identifying 

information 

of the sender was the Relevant 

Number. The Commissioner 

was only able to link the Relevant 

Number to LADH by way of a third 

party information 

notice as explained 

in paragraphs 

20 and 21 above. 

12 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

43. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

44. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because between 14 March 2022 and 30 

April 2022, a confirmed 

total of 31,329 direct marketing 

messages 

were sent by LADH. These messages contained 

direct marketing 

material 

and LADH could not produce any evidence 

of subscribers 

having provided 

valid consent. 

45. Although 

the contravention 

involves 

a relatively 

short period of time 

(six weeks), the weekly volumes of SMS messages sent were high and 

attracted 

a total of 106 complaints. 

Further, 

the Commissioner 

also 

notes that almost 49,938 SMS messages were actually 

sent (of which 

31,329 were delivered). 

46. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

55A(l) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

47. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

LADH's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions 

(even if LADH did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

48. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that LADH deliberately set 

out to 

contravene 

PECR in this instance. 

13 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

49. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two 

elements: 

50. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether LADH knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a risk that these contraventions 

would 

occur. He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met, for the following 

reasons: 

â¢  the LADH Director 

ought to have known that there was a risk that 

the contraventions 

would occur since he has been the director 

of a 

number of companies 

since 2016. As a result, 

he should have been 

fully aware of the responsibilities 

of a director, 

including 

the 

requirement 

to comply with applicable 

legislation; 

â¢  given that LADH was also registered 

with the Commissioner, 

the 

LADH Director 

(who is named in the registration) 

should have been 

aware of the  available 

resources 

on the Commissioner's 

website, 

including 

guidance 

on PECR and direct marketing; 

and 

â¢  during a telephone 

call with the Commissioner's 

investigating 

officer 

on 15 August 2022, the LADH Director: 

(i) demonstrated 

an 

awareness 

for the need to use 'consented' 

data;  (ii) 

acknowledged 

that he should have obtained 

written 

confirmation 

from the third 

party data supplier(s) 

in relation 

to the same; and (iii) confirmed 

his awareness 

of the fines issued by the Commissioner 

in this area. 

51. The Commissioner 

has published 

detailed 

guidance 

for those carrying 

out direct marketing 

explaining 

their legal obligations 

under PECR. 

This guidance 

gives clear advice regarding 

the requirements 

of consent

for direct marketing 

and explains 

the circumstances 

under which 

organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the phone, by text, 

by email, by post, or by fax. In particular 

it states that organisations 

can generally 

only send, or instigate,

and highlights 

the difficulties 

of relying 

on indirect 

consent for 

electronic 

mail. The Commissioner 

has also published  detailed 

guidance 

on consent under the GDPR. In case organisations 

remain unclear on 

their obligations, 

the ICO operates 

a telephone 

helpline. 

ICO 

communications 

about previous enforcement 

action where businesses 

have not complied 

with PECR are also readily 

available. 

52. It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that LADH should have been 

in this area. 
aware of its responsibilities 

53. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether LADH 

failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the contraventions. 

Again, he 

is satisfied

that this condition

fairly 

and lawfully, 

and that they have the necessary 

consent. 

It is not acceptable 

to rely on assurances 

given by third party 

suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper due diligence. 

In this instance, 

the Commissioner 

found that: 

â¢  LADH failed to demonstrate 

that it had obtained 

written 

confirmation 

from the third party data supplier(s) 

that valid consent 

had been obtained 

from the relevant  individuals 

in order to enable 

LADH to send the direct marketing 

SMS messages;

â¢  LADH failed to provide any evidence 

that it had a contract 

in place

Information 

Office 

with the third party data supplier 

in relation 

to the acquisition 

of the 

third party data; and 

â¢  LADH failed to provide any evidence 

that it had conducted 

appropriate 

due diligence 

in this regard. 

SS. As a result, 

there were a number of steps that the LADH failed to take, 

including 

the following: 

â¢  having a  written 

contract 

in place with the third party data 

supplier(s) (rather 

than accepting 

verbal assurances 

that he was 

receiving 

'opt-in'  data); 

â¢  undertaking 

appropriate 

due diligence 

on the third party data 

received, 

including 

obtaining 

the relevant 

'opt-in' 

before 
information 

sending the SMS messages; 

and 

â¢  seeking advice from the Commissioner 

about PECR and direct 

marketing 

compliance. 

56. In the circumstances, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that LADH failed to 

take reasonable 

steps to prevent 

the contraventions. 

57. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue a monetary penalty 

58. The Commissioner 

has taken into account the following 

aggravating 

features 

of this case: 

16 

â¢  The LADH Director 

failed to engage and satisfactorily 

with 
cooperate 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

the Commissioner's 

investigation 

despite 

the opportunities 

given to 

him by the Commissioner's 

investigating 

officer.  Despite 

numerous 

opportunities, 

deadline 

extensions 

and assistance 

provided 

to 

LADH, the LADH Director 

to the 
did not provide any responses 

Commissioner's 

enquiries. 

This resulted 

of an 
in the service 

Information 

Notice which was not complied 

with, which is a criminal 

offence 

contrary 

to section 

47 DPA 1998. 

â¢  Although 

the contravention 

period was relatively 

short, the weekly 

volumes of SMS messages sent were relatively 

high and resulted 

in 

a significant  number 

of complaints 

(106 in total). 

59. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that there are any mitigating 

factors 

in this case. 

60. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

61. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

dated 14 

September 

2023, in which the Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

In reaching 

his final view, the Commissioner 

has taken into 

account the information  provided 

by LADH following 

of the 
service 

Notice of Intent. 

62. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

17 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

63. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

64. The Commissioner 

has attempted 

to consider 

the likely 

impact of a 

monetary penalty on LADH but has been unable to do so given the 

lack of recent publicly 

available 

information. 

LADH was invited 

to 

provide financial  representations 
in response  to 

the Notice of Intent, 

but failed to do so. The Commissioner 

considers 

in the circumstances 

that a penalty remains the appropriate 

course of action. 

65. The Commissioner's underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The sending of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing  messages 

is a matter of  significant 

public 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging 

in these practices. 

The issuing 

of a 

monetary penalty will reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that 

they are only messaging 

those who specifically 

consent to receive 

direct marketing. 

66. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely 

impact of 

the proposed 

intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely 

impact of the 

proposed 

intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

18

Office 

67. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

68. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of Â£50,000 (fifty thousand pounds) is 

reasonable 

and proportionate 

of the case and 
given the particular  facts 

the underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

the penalty. 

Conclusion 

69. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 
office by 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 13 February 2024 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

70. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

12 February 2024 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary 

penalty by 20% to Â£40,000 (forty thousand pounds). However, you 

should be aware that the early payment discount 

is not available 

if you 

decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

71. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal  (Information 

Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice.

Office 

72. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

73. Information 

about appeals is set out in Annex 1. 

74. The Commissioner 

will not take action to enforce a monetary  penalty 

unless: 

â¢ the period specified 

within the notice  within 

which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

â¢ all relevant 

appeals against 

the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn; 

and 

â¢ the period for appealing 

against 

the monetary penalty and any 

variation 

of it has expired. 

75. In England, 

Wales and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty is 

recoverable 

by Order of the County Court or the High Court. In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as 

an extract 

registered 

decree arbitral 

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff 

court of any sheriffdom 

in Scotland.
