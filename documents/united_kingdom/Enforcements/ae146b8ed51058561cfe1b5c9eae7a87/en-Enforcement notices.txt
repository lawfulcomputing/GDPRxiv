1    DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998  SUPERVISORY POWERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER  ENFORCEMENT NOTICE   To: Easylife Limited  Of: 94 Orchard Gate, Greenford, England, UB6 0QP     1. The Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) has decided to issue Easylife Limited (“Easylife”) with an enforcement notice under section 40 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The notice is being issued because of a serious contravention of regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (“PECR”).  2. This notice explains the Commissioner’s decision.           Legal framework  3. Easylife, whose registered office is given above (Companies House Registration Number: 05221840) is the organisation stated in this notice to have instigated the use of a public electronic communications service for the purpose of making unsolicited calls for the purposes of direct marketing contrary to regulation 21 of PECR.                                                                                                                                         2    4. Regulation 21 applies to the making of unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes. It means that if a company wants to make calls promoting a product or service to an individual who has a telephone number which is registered with the Telephone Preference Service Ltd (“TPS”), then that individual must have notified the company that they do not object to receiving such calls from it.  5. Regulation 21 paragraph (1) of PECR provides that:  “(1) A person shall neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where-  (a) the called line is that of a subscriber who has previously notified the caller that such calls should not for the time being be made on that line; or  (b) the number allocated to a subscriber in respect of the called line is one listed in the register kept under regulation 26.”  6. Regulation 21 paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) provide that:         “(2)   A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention    of paragraph (1).  (3)   A person shall not be held to have contravened paragraph (1)(b) where the number allocated to the called line has been listed on the register for less than 28 days preceding that on which the call is made.                                                                                                                                       3     (4)  Where a subscriber who has caused a number allocated to a line of his to be listed in the register kept under regulation 26 has notified a caller that he does not, for the time being, object to such calls being made on that line by that caller, such calls may be made by that caller on that line, notwithstanding that the number allocated to that line is listed in the said register.          (5) Where a subscriber has given a caller notification pursuant to paragraph (4) in relation to a line of his—  (a) the subscriber shall be free to withdraw that notification at any time, and (b) where such notification is withdrawn, the caller shall not make such calls on that line.”  7. Under regulation 26 of PECR, the Commissioner is required to maintain a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified them that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes on those lines. The Telephone Preference Service Limited (“TPS”) is a limited company which operates the register on the Commissioner’s behalf. Businesses who wish to carry out direct marketing by telephone can subscribe to the TPS for a fee and receive from them monthly a list of numbers on that register.  8. Section 122(5) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA18”) defines direct marketing as “the communication (by whatever means) of advertising material or marketing material which is directed to particular                                                                                                                                       4    individuals”. This definition also applies for the purposes of PECR (see regulation 2(2) PECR & Schedule 19 paragraphs 430 & 432(6) DPA18).  9. “Individual” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a living individual and includes an unincorporated body of such individuals”.  10. A “subscriber” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a person who is a party to a contract with a provider of public electronic communications services for the supply of such services”.  11. The contains enforcement provisions at Part V which are exercisable by the Commissioner. Those provisions are modified and extended for the purposes of PECR by Schedule 1 PECR.  12. Section 40(1)(a) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person has contravened or is contravening any of the requirements of the Regulations, he may serve him with an Enforcement Notice requiring him to take within such time as may be specified in the Notice, or to refrain from taking after such time as may be so specified, such steps as are so specified.  13. PECR were enacted to protect the individual’s fundamental right to privacy in the electronic communications sector. PECR were subsequently amended and strengthened. The Commissioner will interpret PECR in a way which is consistent with the Regulations’ overall aim of ensuring high levels of protection for individuals’ privacy rights.                                                                                                                                        5    14. The provisions of the DPA remain in force for the purposes of PECR notwithstanding the introduction of the DPA18: see paragraph 58(1) of Schedule 20 to the DPA18.  The contravention  15. The Commissioner finds that Easylife contravened regulation 21 of PECR.  16. The Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows:  17. Between 1 August 2019 and 19 August 2020, Easylife instigated the use of a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 1,345,732 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the number allocated to the subscriber in respect of the called line was a number listed on the register of numbers kept by the Commissioner in accordance with regulation 26, contrary to regulation 21(1)(b) of PECR. This resulted in 10 complaints being made to the TPS and 15 complaints being made to the Commissioner.  18. The Commissioner is also satisfied for the purposes of regulation 21 that these 1,345,732 unsolicited direct marketing calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who, for the purposes of regulation 21(4), had not notified Easylife that they did not object to receiving such calls.  19. For such notification to be valid under regulation 21(4), the individual must have taken a clear and positive action to override their TPS registration and indicate their willingness to receive marketing calls from the company. The notification should reflect the individual’s choice about                                                                                                                                       6    whether or not they are willing to receive marketing calls. Therefore, where signing up to use a product or service is conditional upon receiving marketing calls, companies will need to demonstrate how this constitutes a clear and positive notification of the individual’s willingness to receive such calls.  20. The notification must clearly indicate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls specifically. Companies cannot rely on individuals opting in to marketing communications generally, unless it is clear that this will include telephone calls.  21. Further, the notification must demonstrate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls from that company specifically. Notifications will not be valid for the purposes of regulation 21(4) if individuals are asked to agree to receive marketing calls from “similar organisations”, “partners”, “selected third parties” or other similar generic descriptions.  22. The Commissioner has considered the lack of evidence of any notifications obtained by Easylife and has concluded that 1,345,732 calls were made at the instigation of Easylife, in each case to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who in each case for the purposes of regulation 21(4) had not notified Easylife that they did not object to receiving such calls.  23. The Commissioner has considered, as he is required to do under section 40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) when deciding whether to serve an Enforcement Notice, whether any contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress. The Commissioner has decided that it is likely that damage or distress has                                                                                                                                       7    been caused in this instance because of the evidence of distress contained within the complaints received, including from elderly and potentially vulnerable individuals.   24. The Commissioner is also concerned by reports of continuing complaints regarding Easylife’s practices which post-date the cited investigation.   25. In view of the matters referred to above, the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the DPA, he requires Easylife to take the steps specified in Annex 1 of this Notice.  Right of Appeal  26. There is a right of appeal against this Notice to the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights), part of the General Regulatory Chamber. Information about appeals is set out in the attached Annex 2.   Dated the 4th day of October 2022.
