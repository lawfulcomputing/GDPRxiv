Between 5 May 2021 to 5 May 2022, there were 47,998 connected calls unsolicited direct marketing calls being made to subscribers who were registered with the TPS and who had not notified Pinnacle Life Limited that they were willing to receive such calls, and four complaints being submitted as a result.
Pinnacle Life Limited came to the Commissioner's attention following a review of TPS complaints from December 2021. The TPS had been unable to identify the organisation making calls following a complaint regarding a call from "Pinnacle Insurance".
The investigation demonstrated that callers were persistent, aggressive, rude at times and ignored requests from individuals not to be contacted.
