A social worker sent copies of a Child and Family Assessment report to the mother and her two ex-partners: each the father of one of her two children. The report contained sensitive personal data which should have been redacted from the copies sent to the partners.
The material disclosed related to previous domestic violence enacted on the mother and the two children. This disclosure put the mother and the two children at risk of actual physical harm and created a volatile and dangerous situation between the parties.
A reprimand has therefore been issued to Nottinghamshire County Council in relation to an infringement of Article 32(1) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).
