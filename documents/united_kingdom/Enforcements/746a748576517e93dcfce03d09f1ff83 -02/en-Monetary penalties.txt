8.  Recital 

32 of the UK GDPR materially 

states that "When the processing 

has multiple 

purposes, 

consent should be given for all of them". Recital 

42 materially 

provides 

that "For consent to be informed, the data subject 

should be aware at least of the identity

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

1 to 
to PECR cases by Schedule 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states:

them to ADS. He 

wanted the process of sending marketing

account and in

The Commissioner 

finds that of those 2,330,423

68. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA 1998 are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

69. The Commissioner 

is satisfied that 

the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because between 1 January 2021 and 31 

January 2022, a confirmed 

total of 2,330,423 

direct marketing 

messages were sent by the 

account that ADS is responsible 

for. These messages contained 

direct marketing 

material 

for which 

subscribers 

had  not provided 

valid consent. 

70. Furthermore, 

none of the SMS messages sent gave individuals 

the 

opportunity 

to opt  out 

of future marketing 

communications. 

71. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA(l) DPA 1998 is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

72. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that the 

actions 

taken by ADS which constituted 

that contravention 

were 

deliberate 

(even if ADS did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR).

76. For the above reasons, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this

was deliberate. 

77. Further 

and in the alternative, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to 

consider whether 
This consideration 

the contravention 
comprises 

two elements: 

identified 

above was negligent. 

17 

78. Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether ADS knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there 

was a risk that these 

contraventions 

would 

occur. He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met because ADS allowed its 

account to be used by its clients 

to send direct marketing 

SMS messages. 

Furthermore, 

ADS specifically 

chose not to identify 

itself 

in the 24,309 SMS messages it admitted 

it sent and failed to 

obtain any valid consent from the  recipients. 

ADS also obtained 

information 

from an organisation 

who had previously 

been fined by  the 

Commissioner. 

79. The Commissioner 

has published 

detailed 

guidance 

for those carrying 

out direct marketing 

explaining 

their legal obligations 

under  PECR. 

This guidance 

gives clear advice regarding 

the requirements 

of consent 

for direct marketing 

and explains 

the circumstances 

under which 

organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the phone, by text, 

by email, by post, or by fax. In particular 

it states that organisations 

can generally 

only send, or instigate, 

marketing 

messages to 

individuals 

if that person has specifically 

consented 

them.

of its responsibilities 

81. Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether ADS 

failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the contraventions. 

Again, he 

is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met. This is because ADS has not 

provided 

evidence 

of any steps it took to mitigate 

the risk of a breach

85. In the circumstances,

86. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied that  condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue  a monetary penalty 

87. The Commissioner 

has taken into account the following 

aggravating 

features 

of this case: 

•  Poor co-operation 
•  ADS allowed its

account to be used to facilitate 

unlawful 

direct marketing  SMS  messages 

which also failed to identify 

the 

sender of such communications; 

and 

•  Nature and context of the  SMS messages sent falsely 

claimed  to 

act on behalf of the Government in connection 

with the 

Government's 

EC03 scheme. 

88. The Commissioner 

has not identified 

any mitigating 

features 

in this 

case. 

89. For the reasons explained 

above, the Commissioner 

is satisfied that the 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

20 

90. The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

in which the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

In reaching 

his final 

view, the Commissioner 

has taken into account the representations 

made by ADS on this matter. 

91. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

92. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

93. The Commissioner 

has considered 

the likely 

impact of a monetary 

penalty on ADS. He has decided on the information 

that is available 

to 

him, that a penalty remains the appropriate 

course of action in the 

circumstances 

of this case. 

94. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective in 

imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The sending of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing messages 

public 
is  a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this  case 

should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance with 

the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses  currently 

engaging in these practices. 

of a 
The issuing 

monetary penalty will reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that 

they are only messaging 

those who specifically 

consent to receive 

direct marketing. 

95. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner has 

also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and  level 

of risks associated  with 

non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

to 
and 

21 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely impact of 

the proposed 

intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely impact of the 

proposed 

intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

96. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

97. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £65,000 (sixty five thousand  pounds)  is 

reasonable 

and proportionate 

given the particular 

facts of the case and 

the underlying  objective 
in imposing 

the penalty. 

Conclusion 

office by 
98. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 28 November 2023 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

99. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

27 November 2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary 

penalty by 20% to £52,000 (fifty 

two thousand pounds). 

However, you 

should be aware that the early payment discount 

is not available 

if you 

decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

100. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal 

(Information 

Rights) 

against: 

22 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

101. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

102. Information 

about appeals is set out in Annex 1. 

103. The Commissioner 

will not take  action 

to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

• the period specified within 

the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

• all relevant 

appeals against the monetary penalty notice and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn; 

and 

• the period for appealing 

against the monetary penalty and any 

variation 

of it has expired. 

104. In England, 

Wales and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty is 

recoverable 

by  Order 

of the County  Court 

or the High  Court.  In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as 

an extract 

registered 

decree arbitral 

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff 

court of any sheriffdom 

in Scotland.
