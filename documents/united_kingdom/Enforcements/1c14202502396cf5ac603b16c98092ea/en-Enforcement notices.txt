•

ICO. 

Information Commissioner's Office 

(b) 

either the address  of the  person or a telephone 
number on which he can be reached free of charge." 

8. Under regulation  26 

of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified 
them 

that  they 

do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

unsolicited 
ea 11s for 

direct 

marketing 

purposes 

on those lines. 

The Telephone 

Preference 

Service 

Limited 

("TPS") 

is a limited 

company which operates 
the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who  wish 

to carry 

out direct  marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to the TPS for a fee 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

9. Section 

122(5) of  the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication (by whatever means) of any advertising  material  which 
is directed to particular individuals". This definition 

also applies 

for the 

purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined 

in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a  living  individual 

and  includes an  unincorporated body of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined 

in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a  person  who is 

a  party to  a  contract with  a provider of public electronic 
communications services for the  supply  of  such  services". 

12. The DPA contains 

enforcement 

provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

Those provisions 

are modified 
and 

extended 

for the purposes 

of PECR by Schedule 

1 PECR. 

13. Section 

40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended 

and modified 

by PECR) 

provides 

that if the Commissioner is 

satisfied 

that a person has 

4 

•

ICO. 

Information Commissioner'sOttice 

contravened or is contravening  any  of the requirements of the 
Regulations,  he  may  serve him  with an Enforcement Notice requiring 
him to take  within such time as may  be  specified in the Notice,  or to 
refrain from  taking after  such  time  as may  be  so specified,  such  steps 
as  are so specified. 

14. 

PECR  were enacted  to protect the individual's fundamental  right to 
privacy in the  electronic communications sector.  PECR were 
subsequently  amended  and strengthened. The Commissioner will 
interpret PECR in a way  which is consistent with the  Regulations' 
overall aim of ensuring high levels of protection for individuals'  privacy 
rights. 

15.  The  provisions of  the DPA  remain in  force for  the purposes of PECR 

notwithstanding the introduction of  the DPA18:  see paragraph  58( 1)  of 
Schedule 20  to the DPA18. 

The contravention 

16.  The Commissioner finds  that F12 contravened  regulations 21  and  24 of 

PECR. 

17.  The Commissioner finds  that the contravention was  as follows: 

18.  Between 05  August 2021  to 20  December 2021,  F12 used a public 
telecommunications service for the purposes of making  1,346,019 
unsolicited calls for  direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the 
number allocated  to  the subscriber in respect of the called  line  was  a 
number  listed  on  the register  of numbers kept by the  Commissioner in 
accordance with  regulation 26,  contrary  to  regulation 21 ( 1 )( b)  of PECR. 
This resulted  in 26 complaints being  made to the TPS  and 41 to the 

5

ICO. 

Information 

Commissoner's 

Office 

i 

Commissioner. 

19.  The Commissioner is also satisfied for the purposes of regulation 21 

that these 1,346,019  unsolicited direct marketing  calls were  made to 

subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least  28  days prior to 

receiving the  calls, and who for  the  purposes of  regulation 21(4)  had 

not notified F12 that they  did not  object  to receiving  such  calls. 

20. 

For  such  notification  to be  valid under regulation  21(4),  the individual 

must have taken a  clear and positive action  to  override their TPS 

registration and  indicate  their  willingness  to receive  marketing calls 

from  the  company.  The notification  should  reflect the  individual's 

choice about  whether or not  they are willing to receive  marketing  calls. 

Therefore,  where signing up to use  a product or service is conditional 

upon receiving marketing  calls,  companies will need to demonstrate 

how  this  constitutes  a clear and positive  notification of the individual's 

willingness to receive such calls. 

21.  The notification  must clearly indicate the individual's willingness t o  

receive  marketing calls specifically.  Companies  cannot rely on 

individuals opting  in  to  marketing communications generally, unless it 

is clear that this will include telephone calls. 

22. 

Further,  the  notification must  demonstrate the individual's willingness 

to receive marketing  calls  from that  company specifically.  Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes of regulation 21( 4)  if individuals are 

asked to agree to receive marketing calls from "similar organisations", 

"partners", "selected third  parties" or other similar generic descriptions. 

23.  The Commissioner has considered the  lack of evidence of any 

notifications  obtained by F12 and is concerned that 1,346,019  calls 

were  made to  subscribers  who had registered with the TPS at least  28 

6 

• 

ICO. 

Information Commissioner's Office 

days  prior  to receiving the calls,  and  who  in each case  for the purposes 
of regulation  21(4)  had  not notified F12 that they did not object  to 
receiving such calls. 

24.  Further,  F12  failed,  as required by  regulation 24  of PECR,  to provide 

the recipient of the calls with the particulars specified at  regulation 
24(2)  of PECR. 

25.  The Commissioner  has  con sidered,  as  he is  required  to  do under 

section 40(2)  of the DPA  (as  extended  and  modified by  PECR)  when 
deciding whether to serve an  Enforcement Notice,  whether  any 
contravention  has  caused or is likely  to  cause any  person damage.  The 
Commissioner has  decided that  it is unlikely  that damage has been 
caused in  this instance. 

26. 

In  view of the  matters  referred  to  above the Commissioner hereby 
gives  notice that,  in  exercise  of  his powers  uneder  section  40  of the 
DPA,  he requires  F12 to take the steps specified in Annex 1 of  this 
Notice. 

Right of Appeal 

27.  There  is  a right of  appeal against this Notice to the  First-tier Tribunal 

(Information  Rights),  part of the General  Regulatory  Chamber. 
Information  about appeals is set out  in  the  attached Annex 2. 

Dated the 2 day of August 2023.
