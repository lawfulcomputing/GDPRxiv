The penalty

 

is in relation 

to a. serious  contravention 

of regulation 

21 of the Privacy

 

and Electronic 

Communications (EC Directive) 

Regulations  2003

 

(" PECR").

 

2.  This notice explains 

the Commissioner's 

decision.

 

Legal framework 

3.  SGS, whose registered 

House 
office is given above (Companies 

Registration 

Number: 12084141) 

is the organisation 

stated in this 

notice to have used a public electronic 

communications 

service 

for the 

purpose of making unsolicited 

calls for the purposes 

of direct marketing

 

contrary 

to regulation 

21 of PECR. 

4.  Regulation  21 

applies 

to the making of unsolicited 

calls for direct 

marketing 

purposes. 

It means that if a company wants to make calls

a product or service to an individual 

who has a telephone 

number  which 

is registered 

with the Telephone 

Preference 

Service Ltd 

("TPS"), 

then that individual 

must have notified 

the company that they 

do not object to receiving 

such calls from it. 

5.  Regulation 

21 paragraph 

that: 
(1) of PECR provides 

"(1) A person shall neither 

use, nor instigate 

the use of, a public 

electronic 

communications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes where-

(a) 

(b) 

the called line is that of a subscriber 

who has previously

 

notified 

the caller that such calls should not for the time being 

be made on that line; or 

the number allocated 

to a subscriber 

in respect of the called 

line is one listed in the register 

kept under regulation 

26." 

6.  Regulation 

21 paragraphs 

(2), (3), (4) and (5) provide that:

(5) Where a subscriber 

has given 

to 
a caller notification 

pursuant 

paragraph 

(4) in relation 

to a line of his-

(a) the subscriber 

shall be free to withdraw that 

notification 

at 

any time, and 

(b) where such notification 

is withdrawn,

7.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers  allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

calls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes 

on those  lines. 

The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited ("TPS") 

is a limited 

company which operates the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry 

out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to the TPS for a fee 

and receive from  them  monthly 

a list of numbers on that register. 

8.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular  individuals". 
This definition 

also 

applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18).

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications services 

for the supply of such services". 

11. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary 

penalty 

if 

the Commissioner

that -

(a) there has been a serious 

contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy

(b) subsection 

(2) or (3) applies. 

(2)  This subsection

contravention. 

12. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory  guidance  under 

section 

SSC ( 1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties) 

(Maximum Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed £500,000. 

13. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with  the 

Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

for individuals' 

privacy 

rights. 

14. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58( 1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

Background 

to the case 

15. Between 3 July 2019 and 5 October 2021 SGS was named Finesta 

Limited ("Finesta"). 

Finesta 

changed  their 

name to SGS on 5 October 

2021. 

16. On 1 October 2019 Kelvin Dean Miles was appointed 

as Finesta's 

sole

The contravention 

34. The Commissioner finds 

that SGS contravened 

regulation 

21 of PECR. 

35. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

36. Between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021 SGS used and/or instigated 

the use of a public telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of 

making 24,241 unsolicited calls 

for direct marketing 

purposes 

to 

subscribers 

where the number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of 

the called line was a number  listed 

on the register 

of numbers kept by 

the Commissioner 

in accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to 

regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. This resulted 

in one complaint 

being  made 

to  the Commissioner. 

37. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 24,241 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the  TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not notified 

SGS.  Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the 

individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company 

specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the  purposes 

of regulation

als are asked to agree to receive

calls from

or other

Commissioner's 

Offic:e 

38. 

For such  notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21(4), the individual

 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

calls 
to receive marketing 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's

 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing calls.

 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional

 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate

 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's

 

willingness 

to receive such calls.

 

39.  The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless  it

 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls.

 

40.  Further, 

the notification  must  demonstrate 

the individual's  willingness

 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications

 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations",

 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions.

 

41.  Despite being given opportunities 

to engage with the Commissioner's

 

investigation, 

SGS did not do so. Therefore, 

SGS did not assert nor 

present any evidence 

to the effect that any of the subscribers 

whose 

numbers were registered 

on the TPS had informed  them 

for the 

purposes of regulation 

21(4) that they did not, for the time being, 

object to such calls being made to those numbers

whether the conditions

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

Seriousness 

of the contraventio

n 

• 

43. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention identified 

above was serious. 

This is because there have been multiple 

breaches 

of regulation 21 by SGS arising 

from the organisation's activities 

between 1 January 

2021 and 30 June 2021, and this led to 24,241 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made to subscribers 

who were 

registered 

with the TPS and who had not notified 

SGS that they were 

willing 

to receive 

such calls, 

and one complaint 

being made as a result. 

44. Additionally, 

the Commissioner 

considers 

the contravention  serious, 

because the call  that  led 

to the complaint 

via the Online  Reporting 

Tool 

was made to an elderly 

and vulnerable 

person. 

45. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

46. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was  deliberate.  In 

this means that 
the Commissioner's view, 

SGS's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions ( even if SGS did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

47. The  Commissioner  considers 

that in this case SGS did deliberately 

contravene 

regulation 21 of PECR. SGS were given an opportunity 

by 

the Commissioner 

to respond to the investigation, 

which provided 

an

for an account to be given on its direct marketing 

operations 

and its systems and operations

PECR. However, SGS did not avail itself

to any of the Commissioner

of this opportunity 
1 s enquiries. 
In the 

and has not 

circumstances, 

the absence of any evidence 

from SGS is consistent 

with the contravention 

being deliberate. 

48.  For the above reasons, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this breach 

was deliberate.

 

49.  Further and in the alternative, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to 

consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent.

 

This consideration 
comprises 

two elements:

 

50.  Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether SGS knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a risk that this contravention 

would occur. 

He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met, for the following 

reasons:

 

51.  As a business 

that was engaged in direct marketing, 

SGS should have 

been aware of the rules 

that apply to such communications.

 

52.  Furthermore, 

the Commissioner 

has also published 

 
detailed 

guidance

for companies 

carrying 

out marketing  explaining 

their legal 

requirements 

under PECR. This guidance 

explains 

the circumstances

 

under which organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the 

phone, by text, by email, by post or by fax. Specifically, 

it states that 

live calls must not be made to any subscriber 

registered with the 

TPS, 

unless the subscriber 

has specifically 

notified 

the company that  they 

do 

not object to receiving 

such calls. 

In case organisations 

remain unclear

 

on their obligations,

communications

with PECR are also readily

53.  It is therefore  reasonable 

to suppose  that 

SGS should have been aware 

of its responsibilities 

in this area. 

54.  Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider

is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met. 

55.  The range of reasonable 

steps that SGS could have taken to prevent 

the contravention 

include 

the screening 

of telephone 

numbers against

 

the TPS register. 

Due to SGS's failure 

to engage with the 

Commissioner, 

this is no evidence 

of any steps being taken to prevent 

the contravention.

 

56.  Given the volume of calls made to telephone 

numbers registered 

on 

the TPS, it is clear  that 

SGS failed to take reasonable 

steps. 

57.  The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied that 

condition 

(b) from section

 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue a monetarv penaltv 

58.  The Commissioner has taken into account the following 

aggravating

 

features 

of this case: 

•  The purpose of the marketing 

was to increase  turnover 

and 

ultimately 

generate 

profit for the organisation.

 

13 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

•  Of the 29,771 calls that SGS made between 1 January 2021 and 30 

June 2021, 24,241  were 

to individuals 

whose numbers were 

registered 

with the TPS. This amounts to 81 % of calls made. 

•  SGS were not registered 

with the Commissioner during 

part of the 

contravention 
period.

 

59.· The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that there are mitigating 

features

 

in this case. 

60.  For the reasons explained 

above,  the 

Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA (1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

558 have been 

complied 

with. 

61.  The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

in which 

the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

In reaching 

his final 

view, the Commissioner 

has received 

no representations 

from SGS. 

62.  The Commissioner 

is accordingly entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty

 

in this case. 

63.  The Commissioner 

has considered  whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty.

 

64.  The Commissioner 

has attempted 

to consider 

the likely 

impact of a 

monetary penalty on SGS but has been unable to do so given the lack 

of recent publicly 

available 

information. 

SGS was invited 

to provide 

financial 

representations 

in response 

to the Notice of Intent but failed

 

to do so. The Commissioner 

considers 

in the circumstances 

that a 

penalty remains the appropriate 

course of action.

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in 

this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity 

to reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning  consumers  who 

are not registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically  indicate 

that they do not object to receiving 

these calls. 

66. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard 

to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely 

impact of 

the proposed intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely 

impact of the 

proposed 

intervention 

on the  wider 

business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

67. 

For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case.

The amount of the penalty 

68. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £70,000 (seventy thousand pounds) is 

reasonable 

and proportionate 

given the  particular  facts 

of the case and 

the underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

the penalty. 

Conclusion 

69. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 
office 

by 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 1 September 2023 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

70. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

31 August 2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary penalty 

by 20% to £56,000 (fifty 

six thousand 

pounds). 

However, you should 

be  aware 

that the early  payment 

discount 

is not available if you decide 

to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

71. There is a right of appeal  to 

the First-tier 

Tribunal 

(Information 

Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

72. Any notice of appeal should be  received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice.
