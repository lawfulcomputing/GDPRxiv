Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

8.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who  have  notified  them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

calls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing  purposes 

on those  lines. 

The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited ("TPS") is a limited 

company which  operates 

the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry 

out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe to the TPS for a fee 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material  which 

is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This definition 

also 

applies 

for the purposes of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a living individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider of 

public electronic 

communications  services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty if 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 
that 

-

(a) there has been a serious 

contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC 

Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 by the person, 

(b) subsection 

(2) or (3) applies.

(2) This subsection 

applies 

if the contravention  was  deliberate. 

(3) This subsection 

applies 

if the person 

-

(a)  knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that 

the contravention 

would occur, but 

(b)  failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the 

contravention. 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

that has been 
of monetary  penalties 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties) 

(Maximum Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not  exceed 

£500,000. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's fundamental 

right to 

privacy in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner  will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to  the DPA18.

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

41. The Commissioner 

has made the above findings 

of fact on 

the 

balance of probabilities. 

42. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a 

contravention 

of regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR by F12 Management 

Ltd and, if so, whether the conditions 

of section 

SSA DPA are satisfied. 

The contravention 

43. The Commissioner 

finds that F12 contravened 

regulations 

21 and 24 of 

PECR. 

44. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

Between 05 August 2021 to 20 December 2021, F12 used a public 

telecommunications service 
for the purposes 

of making 1,346,019 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the 

number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. 

This resulted 

in 26 complaints 

being made to the TPS and 41 to the 

Commissioner. 

45.  The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that  these 

1,346,019 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior  to 

12 

ICO. 

lnlormalion 

Commissioner's 

Office 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who had not notified 

F12 that they did not 

object to receiving 

such calls 

46.  For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21( 4), the individual 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect the 

individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is 

conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to 

demonstrate 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of 

the individual's 

willingness 

calls. 
to receive such 

47.  The notification 

must  clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individua

ls opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone calls. 

48.  Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company specifically.  Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic 

descriptions. 

49.  The  Commissioner 

has considered 

of any 
the lack of evidence 

notifications 

obtained 

by F12 and is concerned 

that 1,346,019 

calls 

were made to subscribers 

who had registered with 

the TPS at least 28 

days prior to receiving the 
calls, 

and who in each case for the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had not notified

Further, 

F12 failed, 

as required 

by regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

of the calls 

at regulation 
with the particulars specified 

24(2) of PECR. 

51.  The Commissioner 

has evidenced 

the breach of regulation 

24 in that 

the name of the company 'F12' was not clearly 

provided 

when making 

the calls. 

There is evidence 

of callers 

using different company 

names. 

This meant individuals were  unable 

to identify 

who was calling 

them, 

to call back and request suppression  or 

to raise a complaint 

against 

the correct 

perpetrator. 

52.  The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are  met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

53.  The  Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because there have been multiple 

breaches 

of regulations 

21 and 24 by F12 arising 

from the organisation's 

activities  between 

5 August 2021 to 20 December 2021 and this led 

to 1,346,019 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made to 

subscribers 

who were registered 

with the TPS and who had not 

notified 

F12 that they 

were willing 

to receive 

such calls,  and 67 

complaints 

being made as a result. 

54.  Further, 

the Commissioner 

considers 

serious 
the contravention 

because the complaints 

evidence 

calls of an abusive nature. 

55.  The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section SSA ( 1) DPA is met.

means that 

F12's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were 

deliberate 

actions ( even if F12 did not actually 

intend thereby to 

contravene 

PECR). 

57.  The Commissioner  considers 

that in this case F12 did deliberately 

contravene 

regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR. This is due to the nature of 

the calls 

and F12 adopting 

tactics 

to avoid detection 

and regulatory 

action. 

58.  For the above reasons, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this breach 

was deliberate. 

59.  Further 

and in the alternative, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to 

consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two elements: 

60.  Firstly, 

He has considered whether 

F12 knew or ought reasonably 

to 

have known that there was a risk that this contravention 

would occur. 

He is satisfied 

that  this 

is met. 
condition 

61.  For example, the Commissioner 

has published 

detailed 

guidance 

for 

companies carrying 

out marketing 

explaining 

their legal requirements 

under PECR. This guidance 

explains 

the circumstances 

under which 

organisations 

are able to carry out marketing over the phone, 

by text, 

by email, by post or by fax. Specifically, 

it states that live calls must 

not be made to any subscriber 

registered 

with the TPS,  unless 

the 

subscriber 

has specifically 

notified the 

company that they 

do not, for 

the time  being,  object 

to receiving 

such calls. 

In case organisations

ICO communications 

about previous

where businesses

62.  Additionally,

period.

63.  Where it is able to identify 

the organisation 

making the calls, 

it is 

standard 

practice 

on each 
of the TPS to contact that organisation 

occasion 

a complaint 

is made. The Commissioner 

has evidence 

that 

F12 would have been sent a notification 

from the TPS for a number of 

the complaints 

being made in this case. That there were a number of 

complaints 

made to the TPS alone over the period of the 

contravention 

should have made F12 aware of the risk that such 

contraventions 

may occur and were 

indeed occurring. 

64. 

It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that F12 should have been 

in this area. 
aware of its responsibilities 

65.  Secondly, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether F12 

failed to take reasonable 

steps  to 

prevent the contravention. 

Again, 

he is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met. 

66.  The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

makes clear that 

organisations 

[acquiring/utilising] 

marketing 

lists from a third party 

must undertake 

rigorous 

checks to satisfy 

themselves 

that the 

personal 

data was obtained 

fairly 

and lawfully, 

that  their 

details 

would 

be passed along for direct marketing

in the case of live calls, 

and that they have the necessary 

notifications 

for the purposes

21(4). It is not acceptable 

to rely on assurances 

given by 

third party suppliers 

without 

undertaking 

proper due diligence. 

67.  Reasonable 

steps in these circumstances 

may also have included: 

•  ensuring 

that call data was screened

•  Maintaining

on TPS who do not object to marketing

•  Providing

•  Performing

68.  Given the volume of calls and complaints, 

it is clear that F12 failed to 

take those reasonable 

steps. 

69.  The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

75.  The Commissioner 

es, he 
has considered whether,  in 

the circumstanc

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

76.  The Commissioner 

has attempted 

to consider 

the likely 

impact of a 

monetary penalty on F12 but has been unable to do so. F12 was 

invited 

to provide financial 

representations 

in response 

to the Notice 

of Intent but failed to do so. The Commissioner 

considers in 

the 

circumstances 

that a penalty remains the appropriate 

course of 

action. 

77.  The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should act as a general 

encouragement

of the Deregulation 

Act  2015;

The amount of the penalty

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £200,000 (two hundred thousand
