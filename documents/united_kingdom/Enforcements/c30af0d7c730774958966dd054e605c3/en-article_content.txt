The reprimand was issued as the South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust (the Trust) was found to have not ensured that its staff were fully trained and prepared to deal with correspondence that was particularly sensitive, and which had been referred to the Trust via legitimate but unusual channels. Staff were not provided with appropriate guidance to ensure that they could deal with sensitive correspondence in every situation. The effect of the infringement was that significant distress was caused to the family of a child patient at a time that was already particularly traumatic for the family.
