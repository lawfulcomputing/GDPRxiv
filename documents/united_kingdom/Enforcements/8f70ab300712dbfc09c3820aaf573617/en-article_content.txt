This caused significant distress to the data subject and has the potential to result in actual harm. In addition, the investigation highlighted that the process to make address changes was not properly communicated to the data subject, and that there was an absence of a written and well communicated process for dealing with correspondence in these sensitive circumstances for staff to use. In addition, the Council had not ensured that all members of staff involved in this incident had received data protection training in the twelve months prior to the incident.
