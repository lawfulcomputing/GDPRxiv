8.  Under  regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified 

them 

calls for 
that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes 

on those lines. 

The TPS is a limited 

company 

which operates 

the register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry out  direct  marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to 

the TPS for a fee and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on 

that register. 

9.  Section  122(5) 

of the DPA18 defines direct  marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

or marketing 
also 

material 

which is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This definition 

applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432( 6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a living 

individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications  services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty 

if 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that -

(a) there has been a serious contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC 

Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 by the person, 

4 

(b) subsection 

(2) or  (3) applies. 

(2) This subsection 

applies 

if the contravention 

was deliberate. 

(3) This subsection 

applies 

if the person 

-

(a) knew or ought to have  known 

that there was a risk that 

the contravention 

would occur, but 

(b) failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the 

contravention. 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC ( 1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties)  (Maximum  Penalty 

and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any penalty determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed £500,000. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring  high 

levels of protection 

for individuals' 

privacy 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

Background to the case 

16. At all material  times,  Poxell  operated  as 

a construction 

and installation 

company. They specialise 

in energy saving products 

such 
and services 

as double glazing, 

doors and solar panels as well as resin  driveways. 

5 

17. Between 31 March 2022 and 20 July 2022 ("the contravention 

period"), 

Poxell's 

sole director 

was Marcel Kellman  who 

was appointed director 

on 11 February 

2022. His  correspondence 

address is listed as -

18. The Commissioner's 

online research 

established 

that Poxell operates 

the website www.poxellhomeim

provements.co.uk. 

The website explains 

that Poxell provides 

services such as resin driveways

, windows and 

solar panels with the aim of improving 

energy efficiency 

and reducing 

household 

bills. 

19. Poxell first came to the attention of the Commissioner 

in April 2022 as 

part of  an investigation 

formed to assess and analyse complaint trends 

in relation 

to  the energy and home improvements 

sector. 

20. In May 2022, the Commissioner 

identified 

a number of complaints from 

individuals who stated they had received calls from an organisation 

about driveways 

using  several  numbers 

prefixed 

with 013027. 

21. On 19 May 2022, the Commissioner 

sent a third  party 

information 

notice to the communications 

service provider 

to obtain subscriber 

information 

about  the  numbers 

prefixed 

O 13027. 

22. In response,  confirmed 

that all of the numbers were 

assigned 

to the  subscriber  Marcel 

Kellman of Poxell Home 

Improvements. also provided 

call data records  for 

the 

contravention period. 

These records showed Poxell made a total of 

3,024,744 

connected calls. 

Of these calls, 

2,647,805 

were made to 

6 

numbers that had been registered 

with the TPS for more 

than 28 days 

at the time of the calls. 

23. 

response 

also confirmed 

that the numbers were allocatEid 

to Poxell on 24 March 2022, with  new  numbers  being 

allocated 

at 

regular intervals 

(up to two new numbers per month during the 

contravention 

period). 

24. The Commissioner 

identified 

a total of 203 complaints 

made to the TPS 

between 31 March 2022 and 20 July 2022. 

25. Within the same period, 

a total of 210 complaints 

were submitted 

via 

the Commissioner's 

Online Reporting 

Tool ("OLRT"). 

26. The  following 

complaints 

are extracts 

from the TPS and OLRT: 

"Driveway 

repairs, 

windows, 

doors, solar, insulation. 
The man 

sounded very scripted 

and was reeling 

off a lot of things that I 

potentially 

could have. When I said I 

wasn't interested 

he 

continued 

to list things." 

"Driveways. 

The frequency 

of these automated 

AI calls and types 

of calls are increasing. 

I did not consent to them and do not want 

them." 

"Automated 

call for a new driveway, 

in the area soon. Register 

and we'll call you back with an appointee 

slot. This has now been 

going on (3-4 times a week) for weeks. Not requested, 

regular 

nuisance 

call." 

7 

"Recorded 

voice -claimed to be John from The Driveway Centre. 

It could not handle an answer other than 'yes' or 'no', so it hung 

up." 

"Driveway 

improvement. 

I am not sure if it was a real person or 

a clever computer programme. 

The person appeared to answer 

my questions 

in general terms but then fell back on the same 

pattern with which they had introduced 

themselves. 

He would 

not give me the full address but said they were based in 

Southampton. 

I believe 

he was setting 

me up for remaking mv 

drive. He asked me how old the drive was." 

"Resin driveways, 

I have had over 20 calls from them in the last 

couple of months, I do not know how to stop them. It appears to 

be an automated 

salesperson 

trying repeatedly  to 

book an appointment 

that can answer your questions 
for a sales rep to co,ne 

and see me." 

"I manage the care of a vulnerable 

95 year old widow with 

severe dementia and no memory. I am trying to keep her safe, 

and worry if she answers one of these calls, 

she will give out her 

name and address." 

"I have had calls like this before and it is getting 

exceedingly 

irritating. 

I did not ask to be called by them. It is cold calling 
and 

should be banned. About half of calls received 

are scam calls and 

I have far more important 

things to do than to answer them. 

They prey on the elderly 

and vulnerable 

and in these days of 

clever people it should be possible 

to get them barred from the 

telephone 

networks." 

8 

"Driveway. 

'John' has called over 40 times. I am sure this is a 

scammer. Barring 

numbers does not work as he uses a new one. 

Is there anyway I can put a stop to this other than changing 

my 

number or individually 

keep baring each new number?" 

"A very aggressive 

man wanting to sell a resin driveway. 
Also 

called 30/05/22  at 

10.01 02/05/22 at 14.27. My elderly 

father 

received 

the call. He is also recovering 

from a stroke, 

and it 

caused him distress." 

"Hi, this is John calling from 

the Driveway 

Centre. I understand 

you have a driveway at the property. 

We're doing a promotion 
.... 

I hung up every time before the message continued 

any further. 

It was pre-recorded 

but sounded very natural 

and convincing 

as 

a real person." 

"Called 

himself 

John -Asked if I had a driveway 

and offered 

a 

promotional 

discount 

for a Show Home When asked how he 

obtained 

my number he said his company works with the 

Renewable 

Energies 

Database which recorded 

my number when I 

had home improvements 

done -But I have had none done and 

my number is unlisted. 

Have  now blocked the number." 

"'John' 

from (supposedly) 

The Driveway Centre based in 

Southampton 

called and asked if 

I still had a driveway 

(I've 

never had one). I asked where he'd got my number from, and he 

said a database 

of householders 

that had had eco-energy 

improvements. 

I asked who they'd bought that from, but he 

wouldn't 

answer and terminated the call." 

9 

27. On 13 June 2022, an initial 

investigation 
letter 

along with a 

spreadsheet 

of complaints 

was sent by email to Poxell. 

The letter 

outlined  Regulation 

powers 
19, 21 and 24 of PECR, the Commissioner's 

and requested 

further 

information 

to ascertain 

Poxell's 

compliance 

with 

the legislation. 

No response 

was received 

by the deadline 

date of 4 July 

2022. 

28. On 5 July 2022, a further 

email was sent to Poxell explaining 

the 

response 

was overdue, 

and the Commissioner 

had still not received t:he 

information 

requested. 

The Commissioner 

asked for the information 

to 

be supplied 

by 19 July 2022. 

29. On 11 July 2022, the Commissioner 

message  for the 

director, 

Marcel Kellman, 

to ascertain 

left a voicemail 
the 

if he had received 

correspondence 

and asked him to return the call as a matter of 

urgency. 

No response 

or telephone 

call was received. 

30. On 28 July 2022, the Commissioner 

sent further 

letters 

to Poxell's 

registered 

office and the director's 

correspondence 

address stating 

tt1ey 

had attempted 

to contact the organisation  on 
several 

occasions, 

and to 

date had not received 

a response. 

The letter advised  Poxell 

that an 

information 

notice could be issued as a last resort if the information 

was not provided 

by the deadline 

date. The Royal Mail tracking 

information 

showed both letters 

were delivered 

and signed for. No 

response 

was received 

to  the letters. 

31. On 15 August 2022, the Commissioner 

attempted 

to contact Poxell by 

telephone 

with no success. 

10 

32. On 25 August 2022, Information 

Notices 

were sent to Poxell's 

registered  office 

and correspondence  address 
requesting 

information 

to 

assess the organisation's 

compliance 

with the legislation. 

The  cover 

letter also reminded  Poxell  that  failure  to 

respond would amount to a 

criminal 

offence. 

Poxell failed to provide a response 

to the Information 

Notices. 

33. On 27 September 

2022, the Commissioner 

issued a third party 

information 

notice to 

to request copies of correspondence 

with Poxell. 

34. On 28 September  2022, responded 

providing 

email 

correspondence 

and the following 

payment information: 

"Poxe/1 

Limited

-The sender of this payment is 
www.poxellhomeimprovements.co.uk 

35. The email correspondence 

provided 

indicated 

that, in August 2022, 

terminated 

their agreement 

with Poxell and ceased 

providing 

services 

for failure 

to pay. 

36. On 6 October 2022,  the 

Commissioner 

sent chaser letters 

to Poxerl, 

requesting 

a response 

within seven days of receipt 

of the letter. 

The 

letter to the registered 

office was delivered 

and signed for on 7 October 

2022 by 

The letter 

to the correspondence 

address was 

returned 

to the sorting 

office and not collected 

by  the addressee. 

No 

response 

was received 

by  the deadline 

date. 

11 

37. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the 2,647,805 

calls were all made 

for the purposes 

of direct marketing 

as defined by section 

122(5) 

DPA18. 

38. The Commissioner 

has made the above findings 

of fact on the 

balance of probabilities. 

39. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a 

contravention 

of regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR by Poxell and, if so, 

whether the conditions 

of section 

SSA DPA are satisfied. 

The contravention 

40. The Commissioner 

finds that  Poxell 

contravened 

21 and 24 
regulations 

of PECR. 

41. The Commissioner 

finds  that 

the contravention 

was as follows: 

42. Between 31 March 2022 and 20 July  2022,  Poxell  used 

a public 

telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 2,647,805 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the 

number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21 ( 1 )(b) of PECR. 

This resulted 

in 203 complaints 

being made to the TPS and a further 

210 complaints 

being made directly 

to the ICO through the ICO Online 

Tool. 
Reporting 

12 

43. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that  these 

2,647,805 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not notified 

Poxell  that  they 

did not object to receiving 

such  calls. 

44. For such notification 

to be valid under regulation 

21(4), the individu21l 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive marketing 

cal.ls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive such calls. 

45. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

46. Further, the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive marketing  calls 
from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions. 

47. Poxell has not provided 

any evidence 

to indicate 

that they received 

valid notifications. 

13 

48. Further, 

Poxell failed, 

as required 

by regulation 

24 of PECR, to providle 

the recipient 

of the calls with the particulars 

specified 

at regulation 

24(2) of PECR. 

49. The Commissioner has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

50. The Commissioner is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is  because 

there have been multiple 

breachE!S 

of regulations 

21 and 24 by Poxell arising 

from the organisation's 

activities 

between 31 March 2022  and 20 July 2022, and this led to 

2,647,805 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made to subscribers 

who were registered 

with the TPS and who had not notified 

Poxell that 

they  were 

willing 

to receive 

such calls,  and 

413 complaints 

being made 

as a result. 

51. The Commissioner 

is therefore  satisfied 
that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

52. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's view, 

this means that 

Poxel l's actions 

which constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

actions 

( even if Pox ell did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

PECR). 

14 

53.  The Commissioner 

considers 

that in this case Poxell did deliberately

 

contravene 

regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR. Marcel Kellman was 

appointed 

director 

of Poxell in February 

2022, and soon after the 

organisation 

obtained 

several 

telephone lines. 

By purchasing 

several

 

telephone 

lines they were able to use a technique 

called 'snowshoeing'

 

which is used by non-complaint 

call centres to spread complaints 

over 

several numbers to evade detection.

 

54.  Poxell failed to identify 

themselves, 

allow their number ( or an 

alternative 

contact number) to be displayed 

to the person receiving 

the 

call or provide a contact address or freephone 

number if asked. 

55.  The Commissioner 

made several 

attempts 

to contact Poxell, 

includin9

 

issuing 

an Information 

Notice, 

a 
which were unsuccessful 

in eliciting 

response. 

After receiving 

the initial 

investigation 

letter, 

Poxell 

continued 

to make unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls until their accoU1nt

 

was terminated 

by their communications 

service 

provider.

 

56.  For the above reasons, 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this breact1

 

was deliberate.

 

57.  Further and in the alternative, 

the Commissioner 

has gone on to 

consider 

whether the contravention 

identified 

above was negligent.

 

This consideration 
comprises 

two elements:

 

58.  Firstly, 

he has considered 

whether Poxell knew or ought 

reasonably 

1to 

have known that there was a risk that this contravention 

would occur. 

He is satisfied that this condition 

is met, given that Poxell relied on 

direct marketing 

due to the nature of its business, 

they should 

15 

reasonably 

have sought to familiarise 

themselves 

with the relevant 

legislation 

and that Poxell failed to engage with the Commissioner's 

investigation. 

59.  The Commissioner 

has also published 

detailed 

guidance 

for companies

 

carrying 

out marketing 

explaining 

their legal requirements 

under PECR. 

This guidance 

explains 

the circumstances  under 

which organisations

 

are able to carry out marketing over the phone, by text, by email, by 
it states that live calls must not be made to 

post or by fax. Specifically, 

any subscriber 

registered 

with the TPS, unless the subscriber 

has 

specifically 

notified 

the company that they do not object to receiving

 

such calls. In case organisations

helpline. 

The Commissioner's

 

communications  about

have not complied 

with PECR are also readily 

available.

 

60.  It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose  that

in this area.

62.  The Commissioner's

guidance 

makes clear that 

organisations 

acquiring 

or utilising 

marketing 

lists from a third party 

must undertake 

rigorous 

checks to satisfy 

themselves 

that the personal

 

data was obtained 

fairly 

and lawfully, 

that their details 

would be passed 

along for direct marketing 

to the specifically 

named organisation 

in the 

case of live calls, 

and that they have the necessary 

notifications 

for 1the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21( 4 ). It is not acceptable 

to rely on assurances

 

given by third party suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper due 

16 

diligence. 

Poxell has provided 

no evidence 

to demonstrate 

that they 

undertook 

proper due diligence. 

63.  Reasonable 

steps in these circumstances 

may also have included: 

screening 

data against the TPS register 

every 28 days; maintaining 

clear records 

of notifications 

received; 

they had an

suitable 

training 

to staff; and performing 

regular 

reviews of their marketing 

databases 

to ensure that the data remains fit for purpose. 

64.  Given the volume of calls and complaints, 

it is clear that Poxell failed to 

take those reasonable 

steps. 

65. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA  is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue a monetary penalty 

66. The Commissioner  has 

taken into account the following 

aggravati

ng 

features 

of this case: 

•  Poxell appear to have deliberately 
•  Poxell used multiple 

CLis to avoid detection 

targeted 

in a  method referred 

vulnerable 

individuals. 

to as 'snowshoeing'; 

and 

•  Poxell failed to engage with the Commissioner's 

investigation. 

67. The Commissioner 

does not consider 

there to be any mitigating 

features 

of this case. 

68. For the reasons explained  above, 

the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA ( 1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

17 

also satisfied 

that the procedural 

rights under section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

69.  The latter has included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent,  dated 

22 July 

2023, in which the Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

No 

representations 

were made by Poxell in response 

to that Notice.

 

70.  The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty

 

in this case. 

71.  The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether,  in the 

circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty.

 

72.  The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty in this case should  act 

as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity

 

to reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning 

consumers 

who are  not 

registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically 

indicate 

that they do not object to receiving 

these calls.

 

73.  In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set  out 

in s108(2)(b) 

of the Deregulation 

Act  2015; 

including1: 

the nature and level of risks  associated 

with non-compliance, 

including

 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken 

by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely 

impact of 

the proposed intervention 

on the business, 

and the likely impact of the 

18 

proposed intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

74. For these  reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

75. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £150,000 (one hundred and fifty 

thousand pounds) is reasonable 

given the 
and proportionate 

particular 

facts of the case and the underlying 

objective 

in imposing  the 

penalty. 

Conclusion 

76. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 
office 

by 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 5 September 2023 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not kept by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

77. If the Commissioner 

receives  full 

payment of the monetary penalty by 

4 September 2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary 

penalty by 20% to £120,000 (one hundred and twenty  thousand 

pounds). However, you should be aware that the early payment 

discount 

is not available 

if you decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

78. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal 

(Information 

Rights) 

against: 

19 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified 

in the monetary penalty 

notice. 

79. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice. 

is set out in Annex 1. 
80. Information  about  appeals 

81. The Commissioner 

will not take action to enforce a monetary penalty 

unless: 

• the period specified 

within the notice within which a monetary 

penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the monetary 

penalty has not been paid; 

• all  relevant  appeals  against 

the monetary penalty  notice 

and any 

variation 

of it have either been decided or withdrawn; 

and 

• the period for appealing 

against the monetary 

penalty and any 

variation 

of it has expired. 

82. In England, 

Wales and Northern 

Ireland, 

the monetary penalty is 

recoverable 

by Order of the County Court or the High Court. In 

Scotland, 

the monetary penalty can be enforced 

in the same manner as 

an extract 

registered 

decree arbitral 

bearing a warrant for execution 

issued by the sheriff 

court of any sheriffdom 

in Scotland.
