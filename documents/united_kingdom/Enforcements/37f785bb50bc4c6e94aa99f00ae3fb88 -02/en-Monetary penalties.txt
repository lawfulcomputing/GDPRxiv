Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

8.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified 

them 

that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive 

ea lls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes 

on those lines. 

The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited 

("TPS") is a limited 

company which operates 

the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. 

Businesses 

who wish to carry 

out direct marketing 

to the TPS for a fee 
by telephone can subscribe 

and receive 

from them monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This definition 

also 

applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of 

PECR as "a living 

individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated body 

of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. Section SSA of the DPA (as applied 

to PECR cases by Schedule 

1 to 

PECR, as variously 

amended) states: 

"(1) The Commissioner 

may serve a person with a monetary penalty if 

the Commissioner 

is satisfied 
that -

(a) there has been a serious 

contravention 

of the requirements 

of the Privacy 

and Electronic 

Communications 

(EC 

Directive) 

Regulations 

2003 by the person,

Commissioner's 

Office 

(b) subsection 

(2) or (3) applies. 

(2) This subsection 
applies 

if the contravention 

was deliberate. 

(3) This subsection 

applies 

if the person 

-

(a) knew or ought to have known that there was a risk that 

the contravention 

would occur, but 

(b) failed to take reasonable 

steps to prevent the 

contravention. 

13. The Commissioner 

has issued statutory 

guidance 

under section 

SSC (1) 

of the DPA about the issuing 

of monetary penalties 

that has been 

published 

on the ICO's website. 

The Data Protection 

(Monetary 

Penalties) 

(Maximum Penalty and Notices) 

Regulations 

2010 prescribe 

that the amount of any  penalty 

determined 

by the Commissioner 

must 

not exceed £500,000. 

14. 

PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy in the electronic 

communications 

sector.  PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations' 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights.

 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in  force 

for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18:  see 

paragraph 

58( 1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18.

attention 

through investigations

 

into organisations 

making  unsolicited 
telephone 

calls to vulnerable

 

individuals 

about  white  goods 

maintenance 

and warranty 

products.

 

19.  During the course of the Commissioner's

linked to a TPS complaint 

made in August 

2021 in relation 

to a call 

received 

from call line identification 
("CLI") 

number 02081910873. 

The 

complainant 

made the following 

statement:

 

"My vulnerable 

mum received 

a call from a Jane at Britannic. 

selling 

her appliance 

cover on her washing machine .. My mum 

is vulnerable 

and 90 years old and suffers 

with confusion. 

Her 

number has been registered 

with the TPS for many years. It 

would appear that a company called White Goods Protection 

contacted 

my mum (although 

they said they were from 

Britannic 

Appliance 

Services) 

and got her to sign up for an 

appliance 

insurance 

product with Britannic 

Appliance 

Services 

(see details 

about this company). 

She was extremely  confused 

and unclear what was happening. 

I contacted 

White Goods 

Protection 

on 0208 191 0873 who advised that there was a 14 

day cooling off 

period and would 

cancel the contract. 
When I 

asked how they got my mum's details 

they advised it was a 

separate 

marketing 

team at White Goods Protection.  I 

can find 

no details 

about this company. I also contacted

They must have asked her to get a bank 

statement

as she has no debit card. I 

have contacted 

the company sending them my power of

them to explain 

why they

any form of direct marketing;

 

from third party businesses, 

which came with 

express opt-in consent to make the call; 

•  had not appointed 

any other business 

to conduct marketing 

on 

RHAP's behalf;

 

•  only made solicited 
calls;
•  had evidence 

 

of customer consent in all cases where RHAP has 

called someone;

 

•  typically 

contacts a 

potential 

customer following 

the customer 

making a request for a call-back 

from RHAP; 

•  would on the initial 

call-back 

call check the individual 

had 

requested 

that  RHAP  calls 

them; 

•  had not historically  screened 

telephone 

numbers against 

the TPS 

register 

as  RHAP had a specific 

request for a call-back; 

and 

•  had consent to call the individuals 

identified 

in the example 

complaints 

shared with RHAP by the Commissioner.

 

In addition, 

RHAP provided 

transcripts 

of calls purporting 

to provide 

evidence 

of consent for two of the calls that were complained  about. 

33.  On 9 December 2021, the Commissioner 

sent further 

queries to RHAP, 

which included 

unanswered 

questions 

from the initial 

investigation

 

letter. 

The questions, 

inter alia, sought to gather the following

 

 

information:
•  confirmation 

from RHAP of the CLis it used;

Information

Office 

•  the volume of calls made and connected

(i.e. obtained 

directly 

from customers 

or purchased 

from third parties); 

•  details 

of RHAP's consent gathering, 

suppression 

management 

and

processes; 

•  details 

about RHAP's relationship 

to an organisation 

called White

•  copies of scripts 

for any direct marketing 

calls made by RHAP, 

training 

materials 

for staff about lawful contact with customers 

and policies 

and procedures 

covering  RHAP's 

responsibilities 

under

•  call recordings 

in the initial

investigation 

letter and for recordings 

of a sample of calls made in 

July 2021 as selected 

by the Commissioner. 

34. On 31 December 2021, RHAP provided 

the  Commissioner with 

recordings 

sent as 
of the two calls which they had previously 

transcripts 

with their response 

dated 23 November 2021. In the call 

recordings, 

the agent calling 

on behalf of RHAP asked the call recipient 

to confirm they had consented 

to receiving the 

call through previous 

contact with "APUK" and "Appliance 

Plan UK". 

35. On 11 January 2022, a letter dated 31 December 2021 was received 

by 

the Commissioner 

from  RHAP. 

The letter reiterated 

RHAP's position 

that it had consent to make the calls. 

It also stated that it seemed 

"wholly 

disproportionate 

would 
that a small number of complaints 

trigger 

a formal investigation" 

and that RHAP was "becoming 

increasingly 

concerned 

that not only have [the 

more 
ICOJ asked for 

examples of compliance, 

but [the ICOJ also want [RHAP] to  answer 

13 

several questions 

around PECR. As previously 

stated, 

the calls [RHAPJ 

make are solicited 

therefore 

they fall outside of PECR".

Commissioner's 

Office 

36. On the 24 February 

2022, the Commissioner 

responded 

to RHAP's 

letter explaining 

that an investigation 

may start with a small number of 

complaints 

and the Commissioner 

may ask an organisation 

questions 

to understand 

the organisation's 

business 

model and compliance. 

The 

Commissioner 

also confirmed 

it  was following 

standard 

lines of enquiry. 

37. At this stage of the investigation, 

RHAP had still  not 

provided 

responses 

to all of the questions. 

The Commissioner 

therefore 

asked for a 

response 

to its questions 

by 3 March 2022. It informed 

RHAP that 

unless the information 

requested 

was provided 

the case would proceed 

on the evidence 

available. 

38. As no further 

response 

was received 

before the deadline 

of 3 March 

2022, an end of investigation 

letter was sent to RHAP on 9 March 2022. 

39. On 10 March 2022, the Commissioner 

requested  further 

information 

from RHAP in relation 

to its relationship 

with  White 

Goods Protection 

and Appliance 

Plan UK. The Commissioner 

also asked RHAP to provide 

the address that RHAP was making its calls from. 

40. On 23 March  2022, 

from

so. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the 15,288  calls 

were all made for 

the purposes 

of direct marketing 

as defined by section 

122(5) DPA 

2018. 

51.  The Commissioner 

has made the above findings 

of fact on the 

balance of probabilities.

 

17 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

52. 

The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether those facts constitute 

a 

contravention 

of Regulations 

21 and 24 of PECR by RHAP and, if so, 

whether the conditions 

of section SSA 

DPA 1998 are satisfied.

 

The contravention 

53.  The Commissioner 

finds that RHAP contravened 

21 and 24 
regulations 

of PECR. 

54.  The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows:

 

55.  Between 1 January 2021 and 31 August 2021, RHAP used a public 

telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 15,288 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

where the 
to subscribers 

number  allocated  to  the 

subscriber 

in  respect 

of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. 

This resulted 

in 4 complaints 

being made to the TPS and the 

Commissioner.

 

56. 

The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 15,288 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who  for the purposes 

of regulation 

21( 4) had 

not notified 

 
RHAP that they did not object to receiving 

such calls.

57.  For such notification 

to be valid under regulation  21(4), 

the individual

 

must have taken a clear and positive 

action to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive marketing 

calls 

from the company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's

 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive marketing 

calls.

 

18 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

how this  constitutes  a 

clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

58. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in  to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

59. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 21(4) 

if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic 

descriptions. 

60. The Commissioner 

has considered 

of any 
the lack of evidence 

notifications 

obtained 

by RHAP and is concerned 

that 15,288 calls were 

made to subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days 

prior to receiving 

the calls, 

and who in each case for the purposes 

of 

Regulation 

21(4) had not notified 

RHAP that they did not object to 

receiving 

such calls. 

61. It is the Commissioner's 

view that RHAP provided 

limited 

that 
evidence 

call recipients 

listed on the TPS had provided 

their consent to receive 

calls from RHAP. On the two call recordings 

provided 

by RHAP, one of 

its agents names a third party, "APUK" or "Appliance 

Plan UK" as 

gaining permission 

on  behalf 

of RHAP for the call. RHAP has not 

provided 

any evidence 

to demonstrate 

Plan UK 
how APUK or Appliance 

gained consent for  them 

to make the call. Further, 

RHAP has not 

provided 

any evidence 

that would 

demonstrate 

to the Commissioner 

19 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

how RHAP or any third party are notified 

by call recipients 

listed on the 

TPS that they do not, for the time being, object to calls from RHAP. 

62. Further, 

RHAP failed,  as 

required 

by Regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

of the calls with the particulars 

specified 

at Regulation 

24(2) of PECR. 

63. The Commissioner 

has gone on to consider 

whether the conditions 

under section 

SSA DPA are met. 

Seriousness 

of the contravention 

64. The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that the contravention 

identified 

above was serious. 

This is because there have been multiple 

breaches 

of Regulations 

21 and 24 by RHAP arising 

from the organisation's 

activities 

between 1 January 2021 and 31 August 2021, and this led to 

15,288 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls being made to subscribers 

who were registered with 

the TPS and who had not notified 

RHAP that 

they were willing 

to receive 

such calls, 

and five complaints 

being made 

as a result. 

65. Analysis 

of complaints 

about RHAP calls reveals that it has been 

making calls to vulnerable 

persons whose telephone 

numbers are listed 

on the TPS. 

66. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is  met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent

20 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

67. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravent

ion identified 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

RHAP's actions which 

constituted 

that contravention 

were deliberate 

( even if RHAP did not actually 

intend thereby to contravene 

actions 
PECR). 

68. The Commissioner 

considers 

that in this case RHAP did deliberately 

contravene 

Regulations 

of RHAP 
21 and 24 of PECR. The behaviours 

throughout 

the Commissioner's 

investigation 

appear to have been 

attempts 

by RHAP to conceal its operations. 

In particular, 

at the close 

of the investigation, 

questions 

put to RHAP remain 

unanswered 

and 

evidence 

demonstrating 

compliance 

with Regulations 

21 and 24 of 

PECR has not been provided. 

69. For the above reasons,  the 

Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that this breach 

was deliberate. 

70. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

that condition 

(b) from section 

SSA (1) DPA 1998 is met. 

The Commissioner's 

decision 

to issue a monetary penalty 

71. The Commissioner 

has taken into account the following 

aggravating 

features 

of this case: 

•  There has been a lack of engagement 

and attempts 

to frustrate 

the investigation. 

As noted above, at the close of the 

investigation 

questions 

put to RHAP remain unanswered 

and 

evidence 

demonstrating 

compliance 

21 and 24 
with Regulations 

of PECR has not been provided. 

In particular, 

RHAP has not 

revealed 

the source of the data it uses to identify 

and contact  call

recipients 

or how it or third parties 

gather consent from call 

recipients 

listed on the TPS to receive 

calls from RHAP. 

•  RHAP made 17,222 calls between January 2021 and August 

2021. Of the 17,222 calls made, 15,288 were to phone numbers 

registered on 

the TPS register. 

This equates to 89% of calls made 

by being to phone numbers registered 

with the TPS. The total 

calls to TPS registered 

telephone 

numbers are the equivalent 

of 

1,911 calls per month or 450 calls per week. 

72. The Commissioner 

does not find any mitigating 

factors 

in this case. 

73. For the reasons explained above, 

the Commissioner 

that the 
is satisfied 

conditions 

from section 

SSA ( 1) DPA have been met in this case. He is 

also satisfied 

that the 

procedural 

rights under section 

55B have been 

complied 

with. 

74. The latter 

has  included 

the issuing 

of a Notice of Intent, 

in which the 

Commissioner 

set out his preliminary 

thinking. 

In reaching 

his final 

view, the Commissioner 

has taken 

into account 

the representations 

made by RHAP. 

75. The Commissioner 

is accordingly 

entitled 

to issue a monetary penalty 

in this case. 

76. The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether, 

in the circumstances, 

he 

should exercise 

his discretion 

so as to issue a monetary penalty. 

77. The Commissioner 

has considered 

the likely 

impact of a monetary 

penalty on RHAP. He has decided on the information 

that is available 

to 

22 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

him, that RHAP has access to sufficient 

financial 

resources 

to pay the 

proposed monetary penalty without causing undue financial 

hardship. 

78. The Commissioner's 

underlying  objective 
in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty notice is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing  calls  is 

public 
a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty  in 

this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently  engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity 

to reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning 

consumers 

who are not registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically 

indicate 

that they do not object to receiving 

these calls. 

79. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of  the Deregulation 

Act 2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic  growth; 

the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely 

impact of 

the proposed intervention 

on the business,  and  the 

likely 

impact of the 

proposed 

intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

80. For these reasons, 

the Commissioner 

has decided to issue a monetary 

penalty in this case. 

The amount of the penalty 

81. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £65,000 (sixty five thousand 

pounds) is
