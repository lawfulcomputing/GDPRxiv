5.  Regulation 

23 of PECR states that "A person shall neither 

transmit, 

nor 

instigate 

the transmission 

of, a communication 

for the purposes 

of 

direct marketing 

by means of electronic  mail 

-

(a) where the identity 

of the person on whose behalf the 

communication 

has been sent has been disguised 

or 

concealed; 

(b) where a valid address to which the recipient 

of the 

communication 

may send a request that such 

communications  cease 

has not been provided 

(c) where that electronic 

mail would contravene 

regulation 

7 of 

the Electronic 

Commerce (EC Directive) 

2002; 
Regulations 

or 

(d) where  that 

electronic 

mail encourages 

recipients 

to visit 

websites 

which contravene 

that regulation." 

6.  Section 122(5) of the Data Protection 

Act 2018 "DPA18" defines 

direct 

marketing 

as "the communication 

(by whatever 

means) of advertising 

or marketing 

material 

which is directed 

to particular  individuals". 

This 

definition 

also applies 

for the purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) 

PECR and paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) to Schedule 

19 of the DPA18). 

7.  From 1 January 2021, consent in PECR has been defined by reference 

to the concept of consent in the UK GDPR as defined in section 
the DPA 2018(11: see regulation 

2(1) of PECR, as amended by Part 3 of 

3(10) of 

Schedule 

3, paragraph 

44 of The Data Protection,

as Regulation 

(EU) 2016/679 

of 27 
of the European Parliament 

and of the Council 

as it forms part of the law of England 

and Wales, Scotland 

and Northern Ireland 

by virtue

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

Electronic Communications 
(Amendments 

etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 

2019/419. 

Article 

4(11) of the UK GDPR sets out the following 

definition: 

"'consent' 

of the data subject 

means any freely given, 

specific, 

informed 

and unambiguous 

indication of 

the data subject's 

wishes by which he or she, by a statement 

or by a clear affirmative 

action, 

signifies 

agreement 

to the processing 

of personal 

data relating 

to him or her''. 

8.  Recital 

32 of the UK GDPR materially 

states that "When the processing 

has multiple 

purposes, 

consent should be given for all of them". Recital 

42 materially 

provides 

that "For consent to be informed, 

the data subject 

should be aware at least of the identity 

of the controller". 

Recital 

43 

materially 

states that "Consent 

is presumed not to be freely given if it 

does not allow separate 

consent to be given to different 

data 
personal 

processing 

operations 

despite 

it being appropriate 

case". 
in the individual 

9.  "Individual" 

is defined 

in regulation  2(1) 

of  PECR as "a living  individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated 

body of such individuals". 

10. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract  with 

a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

11. "Electronic 

mail" is defined 

in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "any text, 

voice, sound or image message sent over a public electronic 

communications 

network which can be stored in the network or in the 

recipient's 

terminal 

equipment 

until it is collected 

by the recipient and 

includes messages 

sent using a short message service". 

12. The DPA contains  enforcement  provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

Those provisions 

are modified 

and 

extended 

for the purposes 

of PECR by Schedule 

1 PECR.

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

13. Section 40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) 

provides 

that if the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that a person has 

contravened 

or is contravening 

any of the requirements 

of the 

Regulations, 

he may serve him with an Enforcement 

Notice requiring 

him  to take within such time as may be specified 

or to 
in the Notice, 

refrain 

from taking after 

such time as may be so specified, 

such steps 

as are so specified. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy in the electronic 

communications 

sector.  PECR  were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret  PECR 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

in a way which is consistent with the Regulations' 
privacy 
for individuals' 

high levels of protection 

rights. 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58(1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

The contravention 

16. The Commissioner 

finds that LADH contravened 

22 and 23 
regulations 

of PECR. 

17. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

18. The Commissioner 

finds that between 14 March 2022 and 30 April 

2022 there were 31,329 direct marketing 

SMS messages received 

by 

subscribers. 

The Commissioner 

finds  that 

LADH transmitted 

the direct 

marketing  messages 

sent, contrary 

to regulation 

22 of PECR. 

5 

19. LADH, as the sender of the direct marketing, 

is required 

to ensure that 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

it is acting in compliance 

with the requirements 

of regulation 

PECR, and to ensure that valid  consent 

to send those  messages 

22 of 
had 

been acquired. 

20. In this instance 

LADH was required 

to demonstrate 

that valid consent 

had been obtained 

in order to enable it to send the direct marketing 

SMS messages. 

21. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

says "organisations 

need to be aware that indirect 

consent will not be enough for texts, 

emails or automated 

calls. 

This is because the rules on electronic 

marketing 

are stricter, 

to reflect the more intrusive nature 

of electronic 

messages." 

22. However, it does go on to say that indirect 

consent may be valid, but 

only if it is clear and specific 

enough. If categories 

of organisations 

are 

referred 

to then those categories 

must be tightly 

defined and the 

organisation 

wanting to use the consent must clearly 

fall within the 

description.  Consent 
is not likely 

to be valid where an individual 

is 

presented 

with a long, seemingly 

exhaustive 

list of categories 

of 

organisations. 

23. For consent to be valid it is required 

to be "freely 

given", 

by which it 

follows 

that if consent to marketing 

is a condition 

service, 

the organisation 

will have to demonstrate 

of subscribing 
how the consent can 

to a 

be said to have been given freely. 

24. Consent is also required 

to be "specific" 

as to the type of marketing 

communication 

to be received, 

and the organisation, 

type of 
or specific 

organisation, 

that will be sending it. 

6 

ICO. 

Commissioner's

Office 

25. Consent will not be "informed" 

if individuals 

do not understand 

what 

they are consenting 

to. Organisations should therefore always ensure 

that the language 

used is clear, easy to understand, 

and not hidden 

away in a privacy 

policy or small print. Consent will not be valid if 

individuals 

are asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic description. 

26. LADH failed to provide any evidence 

that the SMS messages sent were 

solicited 

or that the recipients 

had notified 

LADH that they had 

consented 

to receiving 

such SMS messages. 

In addition, 

based on the 

specific 

SMS messages submitted 

by the complainants, 

the 

Commissioner 

found that most of the SMS messages did not contain 

an 

opportunity 

for individuals 

to opt out. 

27. The Commissioner 

is therefore 

satisfied 

from the evidence 

he has seen 

that LADH was not able to demonstrate 

that it had the necessary 

valid 

consent for the 31,329 direct marketing 

SMS messages received 

by 

subscribers. 

28. The Commissioner 

is further 

satisfied 

that the actions 

of LADH have 

contravened 

regulation 

23 PECR given that the only identifying 

information 

of the sender was the telephone 

number. The 

Commissioner 

was only able to link the telephone 

number to LADH by 

way of a third party information 

notice submitted 

to LADH's 

communications 

service 

provider. 

29. The Commissioner 

has considered, 

as he is required 

to do under 

section 

40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) when 

deciding 

whether to serve an Enforcement 

Notice, 

whether any 

contravention 

has caused or is likely to 

cause any person damage. The 

Commissioner 

has decided that it is likely 

that damage has been 

7 

ICO. 

Commissioner's 

Information 

Office 

caused in this instance. 

In particular, 

the Commissioner 

considers 
that 

the LADH's actions 

had caused (or had potential 

to have caused) 

damage or distress 

to the subscribers 

who received 

the unlawful 

direct 

marketing 

SMS messages, 

which included 

content relating 

to debt 

management, 

which could have led to financially 

vulnerable 

individuals 

being exposed to further  financial 

harm. 

30. In view of the matters referred 

to above the Commissioner 

hereby 

gives notice that, in exercise 

of his powers under section 

40 of the 

DPA, he requires 

LADH to take the steps specified 

in Annex 1 of this 

Notice.

this Notice to the First-tier
