Background to the case 

15. At all material  times 

HHA247L was an appliance 

service 

and repair 

company, offering 

service 

plans for domestic 

white  goods. 

16. HHA247L first came to the attention 

of the Commissioner 

through ani 

operation 

set up to investigate  organisations 

making unsolicited 

telephone 

calls to vulnerable 

individuals 

about white goods 

maintenance 

and warranty 

products. 

17. Two TPS complaints 

named HHA247L as 

the organisation 

that had 

made the calls that were complained 

about. These calls were made on 

with the 
15 June and 16 June 2021 to a number that was registered 

TPS. These complaints 

provided 

the  calling 

line identifier 
("CLI1') as 

"). The caller sold television 

insurance 

to the complainant, 

an elderly 

and vulnerable 

individual, 

and 

took monies on both occasions. 

The complaints 

stated that: 

Complaint 

dated 15 June 2021: "Selling 

insurance 

on TV to my 

e/dery [sic] mother who does not know what she is buying 

(hence the TPS registration). 

My mother has ended up paying 

£190 for insurance 

she does not need. Her TV is not even worth 

that amount.  Please 

note that they called  again

and charged her again for the same amount of money. So I wiJ'I

dated 16 June 2021: "Selling 

my mother (who is 

elderly 

and vulnerable

of her number)

they persuaded 

her to buy the day before! 

My mother ended up paying £380 over two days for insurance 

she does not need for a TV which is not worth a quarter 

of that 

The same company  called 

her two days in succession 

and 

persuaded her to pay both days. Disgraceful." 

18. The TPS identified 

and contacted 

HHA247L regarding 

both complaints. 

With regard to the second complaint, 
they "called

48.  The Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that between 1 June 2021 and 30

which 19,069 were made to subscribers

these calls were all made for

defined by section

whether those facts constitute 

a

of regulation

The contravention 

51.  The Commissioner finds that HHA247L contravened 

regulation 

21 of

52.  The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as  follows:

 

53.  Between 1 June 2021 to 30 November 2021, HHA247L used a public 

telecommunications  service 
for the purposes 

of making 19,069

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

where the

number allocated 

to the subscriber 

in respect of the called line was a 

number listed 

on the register 

kept by the Commissioner 

in accordance

 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

21(1)(b) 

of PECR. This 

resulted 

in two complaints 

being made to the TPS and the 

Commissioner. 

54. 

The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 19,069 unsolicited 

direct marketing calls were made

HHA24 7L that they did not object to receiving such

55. For such notification

and two complaints being 

made to 

 
the TPS and the Commissioner 

as a result.

61.  Additionally, 

the Commissioner 

considers 

the contravention 

serious,

 

made to ain 
because the calls that led to the two TPS complaints  were 

elderly 

and vulnerable 

individual 

who was negatively 

impacted 

by these 

calls. Due to the fact that the said individual  received 

two calls on two 

consecutive 

days, there is some indication 

that the said individual 

may 

have been specifically 

targeted.

 

62.  The Commissioner 

is therefore  satisfied 

that condition 

(a) from 

section 

SSA (1) DPA is met. 

Deliberate 

or negligent 

contraventions 

63.  The Commissioner 

has considered 

whether the contravention 

identified

 

above was deliberate. 

In the Commissioner's 

view, this means that 

HHA247L's  actions  which 

constituted 

that contravention 

were 

deliberate 

actions 

thereby to 
(even if HHA247L did not actually  intend

64.  The  Commissioner 

has gone on to consider  whether 

the contravention

 

identified 

above was negligent. 

This consideration 

comprises 

two 

elements:

 

65.  Firstly, 

he  has considered 

whether HHA247L knew or ought reasonably

 

to have known that there was a risk that this contravention 

would 

occur. He is satisfied 

that this condition 

is met because as a business:

 

that was engaged in direct marketing, 

HHA247L should have been 

aware of the rules that  apply 

to such communications.

 

66.  Furthermore, 

the Commissioner 

has also published  detailed 

guidance:

 

for companies 

carrying 

out marketing 

 
explaining 

their  legal

requirements 

under PECR. This guidance 

explains 

the circumstances

 

under which organisations 

are able to carry out marketing 

over the

phone, by text, by email, by post or by fax. Specifically, 

live calls must  not 

be made to any subscriber 

registered 

with the TPS, 

unless the subscriber  has 

specifically 

notified 

the company that they do 

not object to receiving 

such calls. 

In case organisations

on their obligations,

communications 

about previous 

enforcement 

action where businesses

 

have not complied 

with PECR are also readily 

available.

 

67.  Where it is able to identify 

the organisation 

making the calls, 

it is 

standard 

practice 

of the TPS to contact that organisation 

on each 

occasion 

a complaint 

is made. The Commissioner 

that 
has evidence 

HHA247L would  have 

been sent a notification 

from the TPS for each of 

the complaints 

being made in this case.  That  there  were

complaints 

made to the TPS should have made HHA247L aware of thie 

risk  that 

such contraventions 

may occur  and 

were indeed occurring. 

68. It is therefore 

reasonable 

to suppose that HHA247L should have been 

aware of its responsibilities 

in this area. 

69. Secondly,

has gone on to consider

70. The Commissioner's 

direct marketing 

guidance 

makes  clear  that 

organisations 

acquiring 

or utilising

lists from a third party 

must undertake 

rigorous 

checks to satisfy 

themselves 

that the personal 

data was obtained 

fairly 

and lawfully, 

that their details 

would be passed 

along for direct marketing 

to  the specifically 

named organisation 

in the 

case of live calls, 

and that they have  the  necessary  notifications 

for the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21(4). It is not  acceptable 

to rely on assurances 

given by third  party 

suppliers 

without undertaking 

proper  due 

diligence. 

71. Reasonable 

steps in these circumstances 

may also have included: 

asking its third-party 

data providers 

for evidence 

that the subscriber

had specifically 

notified 

that they did not object to receiving 

calls from 

HHA247L;  screening

The Commissioner's decision 

to issue a monetary penalty 

74.  The Commissioner 

has taken into  account 

the following 

aggravating

 

features 

of this case: 

•  The purpose of the marketing 

was to increase 

turnover 

and ultimately 

generate 

profit for the  organisation.

 

•  Of the 23,295 calls that HHA247L made between 1 June 2021 and 30

 

November 2021, 19,069 were made to subscribers 

registered 

with 

the TPS. This amounts to 81 % of calls made. 

•  HA24 7L purchased 

data  from 

a person claiming 

to represent 

a 

company that had been previously 

fined by the Commissioner  for

 

breaching 

PECR and that was subsequently 

placed into liquidation,

75.  The Commissioner 

does not consider 

that there are any  mitigating

 

features 

in this case. 

76.  The Commissioner 

has considered 

the likely 

impact of a monetary 

penalty on HHA247L. He has decided on the information 

that is 

available 

to him, that a penalty remains the appropriate 

course of 

action in the circumstances 

of this case.

77. The Commissioner's 

underlying 

objective 

in imposing 

a monetary 

penalty  notice 

is to promote compliance 

with PECR. The making of 

unsolicited 

direct marketing 

public 
calls is a matter of significant 

concern. 

A monetary penalty 

in this case should act as a general 

encouragement 

towards compliance 

with the law, or at least as a 

deterrent 

against 

non-compliance, 

on the part of all persons running 

businesses 

currently 

engaging 

in these practices. 

This is an opportunity 

to reinforce 

the need for businesses 

to ensure that they are only 

telephoning 

consumers 

who are not registered 

with the TPS and/or 

specifically 

indicate 

that they do not object to receiving 

these calls. 

78. In making his decision, 

the Commissioner 

has also had 

regard to the 

factors 

set out in s108(2)(b) 

of the  Deregulation  Act 

2015; including: 

the nature and level of risks associated 

with non-compliance, 

including 

the risks to economic growth; the steps taken by the business 

to 

achieve compliance 

and reasons for its failure; 

the willingness 

and 

ability 

of the business 

to address non-compliance; 

the likely  impact 

of 

the proposed 

intervention 

on the  business, 

and the likely  impact 

of the 

proposed 

intervention 

on the wider business 

community, 

both in terms 

of deterring 

non-compliance 

and economic  benefits 

to legitimate 

businesses. 

79. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner 

has decided 

that a penalty in the sum of £55,000.00 

(fifty five thousand 

pounds) is reasonable 

and proportionate 

facts of 
given the particular 

the case and the underlying 

objective

Conclusion 

81. The monetary penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's 
office by 

BACS transfer 

or cheque by 4 September 

2023 at the latest. 

The 

monetary penalty is not  kept 

by the Commissioner 

but will be paid into 

the Consolidated 

Fund which is the Government's 

general bank account 

at the Bank of England. 

82. If the Commissioner 

receives 

full payment of the monetary penalty by 

3 September 

2023 the Commissioner 

will reduce the monetary penalty 

by 20% to £44,000 (Forty four thousand pounds). However, youi 

should be aware that the early payment discount 

is not available 

if you 

decide to exercise 

your right of appeal. 

83. There is a right of appeal to the First-tier 

Tribunal (Information  Rights) 

against: 

(a) the imposition 

of the monetary penalty 

and/or; 

(b) the amount of the penalty specified  in 

the monetary penalty 

notice. 

84. Any notice of appeal should be received 

by the Tribunal 

within 28 days 

of the date of this monetary penalty notice.
