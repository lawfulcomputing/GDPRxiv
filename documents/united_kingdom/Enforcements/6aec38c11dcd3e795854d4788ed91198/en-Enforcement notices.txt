8.  Under regulation 

26 of PECR, the Commissioner 

is required 

to maintain 

a register 

of numbers allocated 

to subscribers 

who have notified 

them 

that they do not  wish, 

for the time being, to receive 

ea lls for 
unsolicited 

direct marketing 

purposes  on 

those lines. 

The Telephone 

Preference 

Service Limited 

("TPS") is a limited 

company which operates 

the 

register 

on the Commissioner's 

behalf. Businesses  who  wish 

to carry 

out direct marketing 

by telephone 

can subscribe 

to the TPS for a fee 

and receive from them  monthly 

a list of numbers on that register. 

9.  Section 122(5) of the DPA18 defines 

direct marketing 

as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of any advertising 

material 

which 

is directed 

to particular 

individuals". 

This definition 

also applies 

for the 

purposes 

of PECR (see regulation 

2(2) PECR & Schedule 

19 paragraphs 

430 & 432(6) DPA18). 

10. "Individual" 

is defined in regulation 

2( 1) of PECR as "a living 

individual 

and includes 

an unincorporated  body 

of such individuals". 

11. A "subscriber" 

is defined in regulation 

2(1) of PECR as "a person who is 

a party to a contract 

with a provider 

of public electronic 

communications 

services 

for the supply of such services". 

12. The DPA contains 

enforcement 

provisions 

at Part V which are 

exercisable 

by the Commissioner. 

Those provisions 

are modified 

and 

extended 

for the purposes 

of PECR by Schedule 

1 PECR. 

13. Section 40(1)(a) 

of the DPA (as extended 

and modified 

by PECR) 

provides 

that if the Commissioner 

is satisfied 

that a person has 

contravened 

or is contravening 

any of the requirements 

of the 

4 

ICO. 

Information 

Commissioner's 

Office 

Regulations, 

he may serve him with an Enforcement 

Notice requiring 

him to take within such time as may be specified 

in the Notice, 
or to 

refrain 

from taking after such time as  may be so specified, 

such steps 

as are so specified. 

14. PECR were enacted to protect 

the individual's 

fundamental 

right to 

privacy 

in the electronic 

communications 

sector. 

PECR were 

subsequently 

amended and strengthened. 

The Commissioner 

will 

interpret 

PECR in a way which is consistent 

with the Regulations'

 

overall 

aim of ensuring 

high levels of protection 

privacy 
for individuals' 

rights.

 

15. The provisions 

of the DPA remain in force for the purposes 

of PECR 

notwithstanding 

the introduction 

of the DPA18: see paragraph 

58( 1) of 

Schedule 

20 to the DPA18. 

The contravention 

16. The Commissioner 

finds that CAL contravened 

regulations 

21 and 24 of 

PECR. 

17. The Commissioner 

finds that the contravention 

was as follows: 

18. Between 1 January to 31 December 2021, CAL used a public 

telecommunications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 511,499 

unsolicited 

calls for direct marketing 

purposes 

to subscribers 

where the 

number allocated 

to the subscriber  in 

respect of the called line was a 

number listed on the register 

of numbers kept by the Commissioner 

in 

accordance 

with regulation 

26, contrary 

to regulation 

2l(l)(b) 

of PECR. 

This resulted 

in nine complaints 

being made to the TPS and the 

5 

ICO. 

lnform;ition 

Commissioner's 

Office 

Commissioner. 

19. The Commissioner 

is also satisfied 

for the purposes 

of regulation 

21 

that these 511,499 unsolicited 

direct marketing 

calls were made to 

subscribers 

who had registered 

with the TPS at least 28 days prior to 

receiving 

the calls, 

and who for  the 

purposes 

of regulation 

21(4) had 

not notified 

CAL that  they 

did not object, 

for the time being, to 

receiving 

such calls. 

20. For such notification to 

be valid under regulation 21(4), 

the individual 

must have taken 

a clear and positive action 
to override 

their TPS 

registration 

and indicate 

their willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls 

from  the 

company. The notification 

should reflect 

the individual's 

choice about whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product or service 

is conditional 

upon receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will need to demonstrate 

how this constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the individual's 

willingness 

to receive such calls. 

21. The notification 

must clearly indicate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing calls 

specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

individuals 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

22. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the individual's 

willingness 

to receive marketing 

calls from that  company 

specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation 

21( 4) if individuals 

are 

asked to agree to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic descriptions.

Commissioner's 

Ottice 

23.  The Commissioner 

has considered 

the response 

from CAL about how 

notifications are obtained 

and is concerned 

that in each case there 

are 

issues regarding 

whether they comply with requirements 

of regulation

 

21(4) 

24. 

Further, 

CAL failed, 

as required 

by regulation 

24 of PECR, to provide 

the recipient 

at regulation 
of the calls with the particulars specified 

24(2) of PECR. 

25. The Commissioner 

has considered, 

as he is required 

to do under 

section 

40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified 

by PECR) when 

deciding 

whether to serve an Enforcement 

Notice, 

whether any 

contravention 

has caused or is likely 

to cause any person damage. The 

Commissioner 

has decided that it is unlikely 

that damage has been 

caused in this instance. 

26. In view of the matters referred 

to above the Commissioner 

hereby 

gives notice that, in exercise 

of his powers under section 

40 of the 

DPA, he requires 

CAL to take the steps specified 

in Annex 1 of this 

Notice. 

Right of Appeal 

27. There is a right of appeal  against 

this Notice to the First-tier 

Tribunal

 

(Information 

Rights), 

part of the General Regulatory 

Chamber. 

Information 

about appeals is set out in the attached 

Annex 2.
