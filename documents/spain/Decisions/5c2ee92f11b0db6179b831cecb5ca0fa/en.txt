It was considered by the then ***PUESTO.1, appropriate to transfer the full text of the

local and regional.

These facts suppose the commission of the defendant of an infraction of article 6.1 of the
RGPD that indicate the legitimate bases for the treatment:
"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data for one
or several specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is
part or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;

d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the
responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that said interests are not
prevail the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party that
require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party is a child.”
The defendant, a party to the civil judicial proceeding, establishes the technical and
organizational and decides as responsible to enable access to the judgment in full with
all personal data when adding it to your website and on FACEBOOK. Probably
was not properly deindexed and is accessible through search engines,
throwing the same literal as when the links existed. The sentence treats the data of the
claimant in relation to the challenge of the disciplinary sanction imposed by the
claimed, sports association. The (...) of the Club that succeeded that of the claimant, detected
a series of irregularities and initiated the aforementioned disciplinary file. The judgment reviews
the actions of the imputed claimant reproaching him for his conduct in the management of the
Club affairs. It refers to the right of association and the private disciplinary sphere and the
application and statutory legitimacy of the Club.

The defendant is the one who exposed it in the open, not only for the partners, the sentence.

  He argues in the transfer of the claim that there was in his day, as a legitimizing basis, the
article 6.1.f) of the RGPD considering that your right to information and
has a legitimate interest in communicating the facts to the general public, (...), adding that

In this case, the concurrence of two fundamental rights recognized in the
Constitution: the fundamental right to the protection of personal data of the
people whose data appear collected in the judicial resolutions, mainly the
claimant and the fundamental right to freedom of information of the association, the Club
that publishes collide and the defendant considers that he has the right to the aforementioned
exposition. However, the relevance of the position and responsibility of the claimant is not

question whether said purpose of informing can be feasible without exposing personal data
contained in a sentence in which one has been a claimed party and at the same time
disciplinary instructor, and if this is in accordance with the principle of proportionality and
adequacy in the use of the data.

On the other hand, this prevalence among rights must be based on exceptions to the
application of data protection regulations “only to the extent that they result
necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing the freedom of
expression and information. In this sense, and expressing ourselves in the terminology
established in the LOPDGDD, the exceptions to the application of said rule must
be understood as manifestations of the principle of proportionality, enshrined in the
Article 5.1 c) of the Organic Law, according to which "Personal data will only be

adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the scope and purposes
determined, explicit and legitimate for which they have been obtained”. Does this mean that
The disclosure of information containing personal data should be considered lawful.
in the cases and areas in which said disclosure is adequate, pertinent and
not excessive in relation to the free exercise of freedom of information. In this way, the
information to be disclosed should be that which is necessary so that information
are relevant to the interests of the association can be known by their
members, understanding public relevance as that which serves the general interest in the
information and does so by referring to a public matter such as facts or events that
affect all citizens.

However, this is not about expressing information or communicating facts that are not
discussed are real, but a document, the sentence integrates in open, with all the
details, not aspects or comments of it, which are exposed outside the circle of
Club members, to whom the Statutes are applicable, and in pdf format which means more
versatility in sending, downloading and forwarding. The information of the management of the association,

sense of it. The respondent indicates that since many of the partners do not reside in the
municipality, and that the integrated publication contributes to the objectivity of the information, being
reasons for exposure. It is not disputed that it may be important and that they are the
partners who must be informed and could have had knowledge, although it could be

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of a fine
to impose in the present case for the infringement of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, of which
holds the claimed party responsible, they are considered concurrent as aggravating
following factors that reveal greater unlawfulness and/or culpability in the conduct of the

Originally, the entire sentence, despite the possibility of being able to appeal, appeared
exposed at the same time in two links, the web and the FACEBOOK page, not implementing
ultimately an effective data removal mechanism.

-Article 83.2.b) GDPR. “Intentionality or negligence in the infringement”: Aspect that
relates the execution of the action to the subject, in the sense of not only imputability of
the infraction to its responsible, but the fact of being able to aggravate or reduce the sanction according to the
degree of guilt. Regarding the imputability to the responsible subject, the principle of
guilt, prevents the admission in the sanctioning administrative law of the
strict liability, although it is also true that the absence of intentionality
It is secondary since this type of infraction is normally committed by a
guilty or negligent action which is sufficient to integrate the subjective element of the
fault. What is valued in this section is its analysis for the graduation of the sanction (art.
40 LRJPAC), observing the specific diligence displayed in the action by the
responsible, which excludes the imposition of a sanction, solely based on the mere
result, that is to say to the principle of strict liability. The succession in the (...)s does not exempt
of the administrative responsibility for the actions produced in the preceding ones, nor
may suppose an eventual change, a blur in the enforceability of behaviors that have been
produced and recognized. Having the claimed the possibility of having acted
differently than you did, the claim was moved and not all links were removed
to the sentence, proving lack of diligence.

-Article 83.2.c) “any measure taken by the data controller or data processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties” Failing to eliminate
of the data, it follows that it did not have adequate and effective measures to eliminate the
data.

Considering the exposed factors, the valuation reached by the fine for the im-
putada is 6,000 euros, without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure.
