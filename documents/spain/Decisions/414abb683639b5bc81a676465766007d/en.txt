PROPOSED RESOLUTION OF SANCTION PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST: D.A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) on February 28,
2022 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against Mapfre España Insurance and Reinsurance Company,
S.A. with NIF A28141935 (hereinafter, the claimed party or Mapfre). The reasons in
on which the claim is based are as follows:

The claimant states that, in June 2021, it requested the
Mapfre company that will provide you with the data they had about you, in their
databases.

Subsequently, after more than two months without receiving a response, he contacted the
claimed via email and they informed him that they had answered his request,
providing him with a copy, which was sent to an address that was not his.

He adds that he appears as the holder of nine policies and as responsible for three
claims, when you have never formalized any contract with Mapfre, any insurance, or
He has given no accident report.

of your data. In addition, he requested that they provide him with the documents that supposedly
would have signed to contract said policies, to give the parties, and to authorize the
treatment of your data.

Thus, Mapfre told him that his data had been blocked and
later they send you a letter informing you that your data was
provided by him or generated as a result of the management or development of his
relationship with Mapfre.
  
And, among other things, it provides the following documentation:

For clarification purposes, it should be noted that, based on the information we have been able to
know, the claimant provided his professional services as a manager or
collaborator of the company FURCORENT, S.L., policyholder of said policies, and
intervened on his behalf and for the management of the policies contracted with my
represented multiple times.

Taking into account the foregoing, it is appropriate to indicate that, as my client has
tried to clarify to the claimant one of the policies - specifically, the number *** POLICY.1-
was signed by the claimant as policyholder, a circumstance that the interested party
cannot be ignored given that, although the request for quotation was promoted by the
company FURCORENT, S.L., it was the claimant himself who directly sent
copy of your ID, driver's license and other documentation necessary to
formalize the policy to my represented.

We attach as document no. 7 a copy of the email sent by D. A.A.A.
to the mediator of the policy, accompanying a copy of your ID and driving license.

The remaining policies were subscribed by FURCORENT, S.L., which included the
claimant as habitual driver of the insured vehicles, a fact that is not
the claimant may be unaware given that, based on what was declared to us at the time
and subsequently confirmed by the mediator of the policies, had intervened in the
subscription process and development of said contracts as manager of said
company to which he provided his services.

In this sense, from the analysis of the background information related to the facts to which
that the claim refers to, it has been verified that all the personal data
related to the claimant were obtained by my client directly from
claimant or through the company FURCORENT, S.L. to which he had been lending his
services as a manager, and treated within the framework of contractual relations in the
that the claimant was listed, either as a policyholder, or as a regular driver,
respecting at all times the regulations on the processing of personal data and
without harming their rights and freedoms in this matter.

In any case, once my client receives the request for deletion
made by the claimant, the appropriate measures have been adopted for the
deletion and blocking of your personal data, attending at all times your
rights and without causing any harm to the interested party>>.
 
THIRD: In accordance with article 65 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(LOPDGDD), when submitted to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
(hereinafter, AEPD) a claim, it must evaluate its admissibility for processing,
must notify the claimant of the decision on the admission or non-admission to
procedure, within three months from the date the claim was entered into this
Agency. If, after this period, there is no such notification, it will be understood
that the processing of the claim continues in accordance with the provisions of Title
VIII of the Law. Said provision is also applicable to the procedures
that the AEPD would have to process in the exercise of the powers assigned to it
attributed by other laws.

The claim has been admitted for processing on May 28, 2022, having elapsed
three months from the time it entered the AEPD.

FOURTH: On September 9, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in
Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

FIFTH: Notified of the aforementioned start-up agreement in accordance with the rules established in
Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations in which, in summary, it states that: "First, MAPFRE ESPAÑA
has a sufficient legal basis for the processing of the personal data of the
claimant. This basis of legality is based on the contractual relationship established with
the policyholder, FURCORENT company, and consequently with all the
figures involved in this, as indicated in article 99 of Law 20/2015,
management, supervision and solvency of insurance companies and
reinsurance companies (LOSSEAR), where it is stated: "insurance entities
may process data of policyholders, insured, beneficiaries or third parties
injured parties, as well as their successors without the need for their
consent for the sole purpose of guaranteeing the full development of the
insurance contract and compliance with the obligations established in this Law and
in the development provisions”. The contractual relationship is established with the
company FURCORENT through the issuance of the different policies and the
perfection of the contract through the payment of the first premium of these
according to the article. 15 of Law 50/1980, of October 8, on Insurance Contracts
(LCS).

MAPFRE ESPAÑA as required by articles 10, 11, 12, 93 and 94 of the LCS,
Prior to entering into the contract with FURCONRENT, you must request
certain information of the policyholder that allows him to assess the risk
(risk statement). This declaration is effective for the entire life of the
contract (aggravations, risk reduction, exclusions, inaccurate statements,
falsehood, etc.). At this point the FURCONRENT policyholder was aware of his
obligation to declare true data knowing that the factors related to the
policyholder, owner, drivers and the vehicle are taken into account for the
risk assessment and premium calculation. Consequently, in the event of
reserve or inaccuracy in your statement the insurer's benefit will be reduced
proportionally to the difference between the agreed premium and that which would have been
applied if the true entity of the risk was known. that have been omitted
due to bad faith, MAPFRE ESPAÑA will be released from the payment of the benefit.
Document 1 This information includes, but is not limited to, the statement of the following
figures, which the company FURCORENT identifies as follows: • Taker of
the policy: the company FURCORENT. • Owner of the asset to be insured: the company
FURCORENT. • Policy payer: the company FURCORENT. • Regular driver

It is the POLICYHOLDER who has the obligation to inform and obtain the

In relation to the allegations made by the claimed party, that the mediator
has a treatment manager contract with Mapfre and that in this case, it has
breached the issuance and contracting technical instructions established by
Mapfre, in relation to policy 0***POLIZA.101, in which the claimant not only

1. For the purposes provided in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, as well as in
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27
of 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons with regard to the

Agency agreement.

In the case examined, the regulations set forth and the statements
made by the claimed party, it can be inferred that the latter acts as the party responsible for the
treatment.

In article 4.8 of the GDPR, the person in charge of treatment is defined as the person
physical or legal entity, public authority, service or other body that processes data
personal on behalf of the data controller.

All processing of personal data carried out by a manager must be governed by a
contract or other legal act under Union or State law

9/18

members entered into between the person in charge and the person in charge, as stipulated in the
Article 28, paragraph 3, of the GDPR.

In this regard, Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of "responsible for the
treatment" and "in charge of the treatment" in the RGPD, adopted by the CEPD, on 7
July 2021, detail the following:

"Although the elements provided for in Article 28 of the Regulation constitute its
essential content, the contract must serve so that the person in charge and the person in charge
clarify, by means of detailed instructions, how these will be applied in practice
fundamental elements. Therefore, the treatment contract should not be limited to
reproduce the provisions of the GDPR, but must include more information
specific and specific information about how the requirements will be met and the degree of
security that will be required for the processing of personal data object of the
treatment contract. Far from being a merely formal exercise, negotiation and
stipulation of the conditions of the contract serve to specify the details of the
treatment."

They add that “In general, the treatment contract establishes who is the party
determinant (the controller) and who, the party that follows the
instructions (the person in charge of the treatment)”. Now, "If a party decides in the
practice how and why personal data is processed, that part will be the
responsible for the treatment, even if the contract stipulates that it is the person in charge”

To determine the responsibility of the claimed party, it is necessary to take into account
that, if a processor infringes the Regulation when determining the purposes and
means of treatment, will be considered responsible for the treatment with respect to
said treatment (article 28, paragraph 10, of the GDPR).

Regarding the "Ends and means" the aforementioned guidelines include the following
considerations:

"(...)

Dictionaries define the word end as an "anticipated result that is pursued
or that guides the planned action" and the word medium as the "way in which
obtains a result or achieves an objective"

(…)

The determination of ends and means is equivalent to deciding, respectively, the
why and how of treatment: in a particular treatment operation, the
The controller is the party that determines why the processing takes place.
treatment (i.e. “for what purpose” or “for what”) and how this objective will be achieved
(ie, what means will be used to achieve it). A natural or legal person who
thus influences the processing of personal data participates, therefore, in the
determination of the purposes and means of such treatment in accordance with the
definition provided for in article 4, point 7, of the GDPR.
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/18

The data controller must decide both on the end and on the means
treatment, as described below. Consequently, it cannot
limit itself to determining the end: it must also make decisions about the means of the
treatment. In contrast, the party acting as processor can never determine
the end of the treatment. In practice, if a data controller uses a
person in charge to carry out the treatment on behalf of that person, the person in charge
You will usually be able to make some of your own decisions about how to do this. He
CEPD recognizes that the person in charge of the treatment can enjoy a certain margin of
maneuver to make some decisions about treatment. In this sense, it is
necessary to clarify what degree of influence on the "why" and "how" entails that
an entity is considered responsible for the treatment and to what extent can the
person in charge of treatment to make their own decisions.

(…)”

In this case, taking into account the above, it can be concluded that the
The mere fact that the data processor fails to comply with Mapfre's instructions does not
release the defendant from liability. It has not proven that the
person in charge of the treatment was acting as the person in charge, since the
Treatment has been carried out following the instructions of the person in charge.

Thus, the claimed party violated article 6.1 of the GDPR, since it made the
treatment, without proving that he had contracted legitimately, had
of your consent for the collection and subsequent processing of your data
personal, or there is some other cause that makes the treatment carried out lawful.

Consequently, it has processed the personal data of the party
claimant without having proven that he has the legal authorization to do so.

Article 6.1 of the GDPR states that processing "will be lawful if it is necessary for the
performance of a contract to which the interested party is a party.

It was therefore essential that the claimed party accredit before this Agency that the
claimant had taken out said policy.
The claimed party has contributed to this Agency the issued policies: *** POLICY.2;
*** POLICY.3; 2***POLICY.4; *** POLICY.5; *** POLICY.6; *** POLICY.7; *** POLICY.8;
*** POLICY.9, in which all of them appear as policyholder the
company FURCORENT and as their habitual driver the claimant
identifying as an employee.

However, Mapfre certifies that the policy 0***POLIZA.101 contains the part
claimant as policyholder.

In its defense, the requested entity has stated that the mediator has with Mapfre
a treatment manager contract and that, in this case, has breached the
technical instructions for issuance and contracting established by Mapfre, providing the
custom treatment contract

11/18

Well, the responsibility falls on the data controller (Mapfre), not
on the person in charge (the agent) except in the case of article 28.3 of the
GDPR in which the person in charge was acting as responsible

Therefore, it is considered that the claimed entity has violated article 6 of the GDPR,
for carrying out a processing of personal data without legitimacy.

II

Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data.

"1. Processing will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person.

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

On this question of the legality of the treatment, Recital 40 also affects
of the aforementioned GDPR, when it provides that "For the treatment to be lawful, the
Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on
some other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in the present
Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation
applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract with
to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the

concerned prior to the conclusion of a contract."

It should be noted that in one of the insurance contracts, as acknowledged by the party
claimed, the claimant party appears as the policyholder, and did not consent to the contracting
therefore, there is no legitimizing basis for those included in article 6
of the GDPR.

The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as "personal data":
any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");
An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social of said person.

Hence, the claimant's data was processed without a legitimizing basis.

IV.

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
