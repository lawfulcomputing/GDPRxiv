On 01/31/2022, the firm was presented with an Informed Consent that

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the DGGC, so that
proceed to its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements established in the regulations of
Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on 06/14/2022 as stated in the
acknowledgment of receipt in the file.

On 06/27/2022, this Agency received a written response indicating:

"The General Directorate of the Civil Guard has protocolized as a measure, both for
citizens as well as for the civil guards themselves, who, when there is a
medical leave with a diagnosis of mental illness, the withdrawal of the
weapons, both official and private, that in his capacity as a member of the Armed Forces
and State Security Bodies of which they may be in possession.
With the foregoing, an attempt is made to prevent the state of mental alteration that he presents
causes both harmful actions against third parties and self-injurious behaviors of a nature
suicidal, which redounds to the benefit not only of society, but also of the
own member of the Body as a human being.

In order to put the foregoing into effect in the case at hand, an email was sent
email on October 13, 2021, from the Medical Service of the Command

from ***LOCATION.1 to ***COMPANY.1 and ***POINT.2, with the following
text:

<<Today the assistance service has learned
of this Unit, of the medical leave related to the Civil Guard D.A.A.A.
(XX.XXX.XXX), bound for ***POINT.1.
Likewise, it is agreed that said Civil Guard must appear at the
Office of Psychology of the Command to the object of recognition on the day
11/18/XX at 09:00.
Proceed to the withdrawal of official and private weapons possessed by said
Civil Guard>>

In the text of said email, as can be seen, no reference is made
any diagnosis or other health data. The fact that it is mentioned that he is of
low for the Service is nothing new, since the Hierarchical Superior who
receives already knows this, since the Civil Guard itself has to communicate it to
effects of not being named Service until registration occurs (regardless of the
type of sick leave) as in the case of any worker, an issue that will be
known by the rest of the classmates by the simple observation of his absence in the
I work without the need for you to communicate anything.

In this way, it cannot be accepted, as indicated by the claimant, that
there has been indiscriminate communication of their situation in the absence of adoption
of security measures. The only thing that has been communicated is the administrative fact
of your Temporary Work Incapacity, which is necessary for the name of the person to know
the daily service, not to count on it.

We understand that the necessary confidentiality measures have been kept in the
as possible, knowing only those who had a “need to know” and
insofar as they had it."

THIRD: On August 12, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the
LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the claimant party was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: On October 25, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,
for the alleged infringement of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.4 of the
GDPR.

Once the Initiation Agreement was notified, the DGGC submitted a written statement of allegations, in which
synthesis stated:

-That the reason for the communication made by email, sent by the
Medical Service of the Command of ***LOCATION.1 and the ***COMPAÑÍA.1 and the
***POINT.2, it was not only to notify who appoints daily service the medical leave of
the complaining party, in order that no service be indicated, as indicated in the
response to the transfer of the claim that the AEPD made at the time, in the
which textually specify:

  "In the text of said email, as can be seen, no reference is made
any diagnosis or other health data. (...) The only thing that has been communicated is the
administrative fact of your Temporary Work Incapacity, which is necessary for
know who appoints the daily service, so as not to count on him”,

but also, the purpose of said email was to indicate that "the claimant
must go to the psychology office on the mentioned date to be submitted to the
mandatory recognition according to internal procedures", because they do not understand that
"There is no other way to let you know but to send a communication to your destination at
in order to be informed of it", given that "according to article 23 of the Organic Law
11/2007 of October 22, Regulating the Rights and Duties of the Members of
the Civil Guard, nominated for psychophysical examinations, the Civil Guards have the
obligation to submit to the necessary psychophysical examinations to
determine their fitness for service.

In this regard, this Agency observes that the purpose
initial communication of an absence due to IT, for the purpose of not appointing
service to the person who is on leave, with the addition in the letter of
allegations, to also communicate in the same email that
must notify the civil guard on discharge of their obligation to
undergo an examination, "since according to article 23 of the Law
Organic 11/2007 of October 22, Regulating the Rights and Duties of
the Members of the Civil Guard, nominated for psychophysical examinations, the
Civil Guards have the obligation to submit to examinations
psychophysical tests necessary to determine his fitness for service.

This Agency does not share the criteria that said
communication to the ***COMPANY.1 and the ***POINT.2, given that, the Law
29/2014, of November 28, of the Civil Guard Personnel Regime
indicates in its article 103: (the underlining corresponds to the AEPD)

1. In the Health of the Civil Guard are included the medical services and the
health inspection and will have the support of psychological care.

2. Corresponds to the Health of the Civil Guard, regardless of the
health benefits to which Corps personnel are entitled for their
belonging to the Special Regime of the Social Security of the Forces
Armed:

a) Determine the existence of the precise psychophysical conditions for the
admission to educational training centers and for the loss of status
student, in accordance with the provisions of article 35.2 and article 48.1
b).

b) Carry out the follow-up and control of the temporary absences of the personnel of the
Civil Guard Corps, and advise and report on this matter to the Chiefs
unit, center or organism.

c) Assess and confirm, where appropriate, temporary leave that have been
issued by physicians unrelated to Body Health whose recovery
has not occurred before the tenth day after they were issued.

28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

5/9

d) Arrange that those who are on temporary leave be
subjected to the psychophysical examinations deemed appropriate.

e) Issue opinions directly or through medical-expert bodies,
detailing in them the diagnosis of the disease or pathological process and the
degree of disability that corresponds to determine the aptitude for the
stakeholder service.

f) Issue the mandatory opinions determined by the class legislation
liabilities of the State, for the purpose of determining, where appropriate, in accordance with the
established in article 98, the limitation to occupy certain destinations or
the retirement pass as a consequence of the fact that the affected person is disabled
totally for the performance of the functions of the Civil Guard.

For the development of its powers, the Health of the Civil Guard may
establish contracts or collaboration agreements with certain
medical professionals or public or private entities.

3. The services referred to in the first section of this article are
authorized to access the reports and diagnoses related to the
situations of temporary leave of the members of the Corps, in order to exercise the
functions entrusted to them, with the limits established by the
Current regulations regarding the treatment and protection of personal data
staff.

In accordance with section 3 of article 103 of the aforementioned legal text, the
reports and diagnoses related to situations of temporary leave does not have
to be known neither by hierarchical superiors nor by people
in charge of setting daily the services to be performed by the staff
assigned to the corresponding unit.

Therefore, this Agency confirms the criterion that the summons to the Cabinet of
Psychology is a piece of information that is not pertinent, adequate or necessary in communication
made of the situation of temporary leave of the complaining party.

It is considered more appropriate to make such a summons to the affected person
directly, and not across your entire target drive.

FIFTH: On November 14, 2022, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
impose on D.G. OF THE CIVIL GUARD, with NIF S2816003D, for an infraction of the
Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR a penalty of
warning.

Notified of the resolution proposal, no allegations have been presented to it.

In view of all the proceedings, by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

<<Today the assistance service has learned

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

Article 5, "Principles relating to processing" of the GDPR establishes:

II

"1. Personal data will be:
(…)
c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");"

It must be clarified that this article does not limit the excess of data, but the need. Is
In other words, the personal data will be "adequate, pertinent and limited to the need",
for which they were collected, in such a way that, if the objective pursued can
achieved without excessive data processing, this should be done at all
case.

Similarly, recital 39 of the GDPR indicates that: "Personal data only
should be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by
other media." Therefore, only the data that is "adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are obtained or processed”. The
categories of data selected for processing must be those strictly

necessary to achieve the stated purpose and the controller must
strictly limit data collection to information that is directly
related to the specific goal that is intended to be achieved.

In this case, the email sent by the Medical Service of the
Command of ***LOCATION.1 to ***COMPANY.1 and ***POSITION.2, in which
it is specified that the complaining party "should appear in the Cabinet of
Psychology of the Command to the object of recognition" contains excessive data
for the intended purpose.

Although it may be considered necessary, as stated by the DGGC, to send the
information of the claiming party's medical leave to his hierarchical superior, including
the fact that it is necessary to communicate, likewise, that it should be
proceed to the withdrawal of weapons, it is totally unnecessary to add medical data
specific, such as the appointment in the Psychology cabinet, since, to know that
the complaining party is not available for the service due to being in a situation of
Work Incapacity, it is not essential to explicitly cite the reason given
place to said medical leave or the tests that must be submitted.

From the instruction carried out in this proceeding it is concluded that the
DGGC has violated the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, by sending an email
email to the unit of destination of the complaining party, in which, in addition to
communicate that you are on leave, which must be taken into account to
not assign him service, it is indicated that he must report to the psychology office,
This last fact is unnecessary to add.

Article 83.5 of the GDPR, under the heading "General conditions for the taxation
of administrative fines”, provides:

II

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that:

"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very
serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

Article 83 paragraph 7 of the GDPR provides the following:

IV.

Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under
of Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether
can, and to what extent, impose administrative fines on authorities and bodies
public establishments established in that Member State.”

Likewise, article 77 “Regime applicable to certain categories of
responsible or in charge of the treatment" of the LOPDGDD provides the following:

"1. The regime established in this article will be applicable to the treatment of
who are responsible or in charge:

(…)
c) The General State Administration, the Administrations of the communities
autonomous entities and the entities that make up the Local Administration.
(…)

2. When the managers or managers listed in section 1 commit
any of the offenses referred to in articles 72 to 74 of this law
