The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

The Data Inspectorate's decision
The Data Inspectorate states that the upper secondary school board in Skellefteå municipality
by using face recognition via camera for presence control of
students have processed personal data in violation of
Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation1 by dealing with pupils
personal data in a more intrusive way for personal privacy
way and included more personal data than is necessary for
the stated purpose (attendance check),
Article 9 by processing sensitive personal data
(biometric data) without a valid treatment
exceptions to the ban on the processing of sensitive personal data and
Articles 35 and 36 by failing to meet the requirements of a
impact assessment and not having submitted one
prior consultation with the Data Inspectorate.
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of ch. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act2 and
Articles 58 (2) and 83 of the Data Protection Ordinance that the Upper Secondary School Board in
Skellefteå municipality must pay an administrative sanction fee of 200,000
kronor.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Upper Secondary School Board in Skellefteå municipality
is likely to infringe Articles 5 and 9 with the continued use of
face recognition for presence control.
The Data Inspectorate therefore decides to give the Upper Secondary School Board in Skellefteå
municipality a warning under Article 58 (2) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation.

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has, through information in the media, been made aware that
The upper secondary school board in Skellefteå municipality (hereinafter the upper secondary school board) in one
pilot project at Anderstorps gymnasium in Skellefteå has used

1

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General
Data Protection Regulation).
2 The Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation

face recognition to record students' attendance in a class during some
weeks.
The purpose of the supervision has been to review the upper secondary school board's
processing of personal data by face recognition for
attendance control has been in accordance with the data protection rules.
The Data Inspectorate has examined the personal data processing that
the upper secondary school board has carried out in the current project and also taken
position on any future treatments. The Data Inspectorate has within
in the framework of this supervision has not made any assessment regarding safety or
the duty to provide information in connection with the treatments in question.
The review has revealed that the upper secondary school board has for three weeks
processed personal data through face recognition to check
the presence of 22 high school students and that the high school board is considering that
in the future process personal data through the use of face recognition
for attendance control. The purpose has been to in a simpler and more efficient way
register attendance at high school lessons. To register attendance at
a traditional way takes according to the high school board 10 minutes per lesson and
by using face recognition technology for presence control it would
according to the board save 17,280 hours per year at the current school.
The Upper Secondary School Board has stated that the face recognition has been carried out
in that the students were filmed by a camera as they entered a classroom.
Images from the camera surveillance have been compared with pre-registered ones
pictures of each participating student's face. The information that has been registered is
biometric data in the form of facial images and first and last names. The information
has been stored on a local computer without an internet connection stored in one
locked cabinet. Express approvals have been obtained from guardians and
it has been possible to waive the registration of personal data with
biometric data.
The supervisory case began with a supervisory letter on 19 February 2019. Answer to
The supervisory letter was received on March 15, 2019, with the addition of appendices on
April 2, 2019. Later additions from the high school board came in on the 16th
August and 19 August 2019.

Justification of decision
The responsibility for personal data
The Upper Secondary School Board has stated that the board is responsible for personal data for them
personal data processing that has taken place within the framework of the project with
face recognition for attendance control at Anderstorps gymnasium in
Skellefteå municipality. The Data Inspectorate shares this view.
Trial project
The current personal data processing has taken place within the framework of one
pilot project. The Data Inspectorate finds that the Data Protection Ordinance
does not contain any exceptions for pilot or pilot activities.
The requirements of the regulation therefore also need to be met in order to implement them
types of activities.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data (Article 6)
Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation states that processing is only lawful
if one of the conditions specified in the article is met.
Consent as a legal basis
The Upper Secondary School Board has in its opinion received by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on
March 15, 2019 p. a. stated that consent has been given to the treatment that has
occurred within the framework of attendance management.
The upper secondary school board's opinion states, among other things: a. the following.
“Ie. the students' guardians receive information about the project's purpose and
which personal data processing will take place and may give its
express and voluntary approval for the processing of personal data.
Students who do not want to participate do not need to participate, attendance is checked then
according to previous routines. Students also receive information that they reach as
preferably can withdraw their approval for the processing of personal data.
(p. 6). ”
Article 6 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation states that a
personal data processing is legal if the data subject has left his
consent to the processing of his personal data for one or more specific
purpose.

4 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

Consent of the data subject is defined in Article 4 (11) of the Data Protection Regulation
such as any kind of voluntary, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will,
by which the data subject, either by a statement or by a
unequivocal affirmative action, accepts the processing of personal data relating to
him or her.
Recital 43 of the Data Protection Regulation further states the following.
“To ensure that consent is given voluntarily, it should not constitute
valid legal basis for the processing of personal data in a specific case
where there is significant inequality between the data subject and the data subject
personal data controller, especially if the personal data controller is one
public authority and it is therefore unlikely that the consent has
provided voluntarily in respect of all circumstances such as this particular
situation includes. "
This means that the assessment of a consent has been given voluntarily not only
shall take place on the basis of the freedom of choice that prevails, but also the relationship that
exists between the registered person and the person responsible for personal data.
The scope for voluntary consent in the public sphere is therefore
limited. Within the school area, it is clear that the student is in a position of dependence
to the school in terms of grades, study grants, education and thus the opportunity to
future work or further studies. It is also often a question of children.
The Education Data Inquiry made the assessment that it is still possible to
for certain personal data processing use consent also in
the relationship between a child's guardian and a preschool and a pupil
guardian or the student himself depending on age and a school. An example
on when consent could be the appropriate basis for
personal data processing is prior to photographing students for the purpose of creating
electronic school catalogs or photography to document
the activities in preschool and school, not least for the purpose of being able to account for
the one for the children's guardians. (SOU 2017: 49 EU Data Protection Regulation
and the field of education p. 137)
Attendance control is a public law regulated obligation for
school activities and the reporting of attendance are of significant importance for

5 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

eleven. This treatment is therefore not comparable to it
personal data processing that can be done to administer school photography.
During attendance checks, the student is in such a position of dependence that it prevails
significant inequality. The Data Inspectorate therefore assesses that consent does not
may constitute a legal basis for the processing of personal data such as this
supervision includes.
The treatment is necessary to perform a task of general interest
The Upper Secondary School Board has also stated that the legal basis for the
personal data processing that has taken place within the framework of the project with
face recognition is the administrative law's requirement for efficient case management,
the Education Act's requirements for measures in the event of absence and the obligation for
high schools to report invalid absences to Central
the Student Aid Board (CSN).
According to Article 6 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation, processing is lawful if it is
necessary to perform a task of general interest or as part of it
exercise of personal data controllers' authority.
Article 6 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation states, inter alia, that Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt
the application of the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation in order to comply
point e of the same article. According to Article 6 (3), the task shall be of general interest
in accordance with Article 6 (1) (e) be determined in accordance with Union or national law
Right.
According to ch. Section 16, first paragraph of the Education Act (2010: 800) requires a student in
high school participate in the activities organized to provide the intended
the education, if the student does not have a valid reason for not attending.
If a student in upper secondary school is absent from that activity without a valid reason
arranged to provide the intended education, the principal shall ensure that
the student's guardian is informed on the same day that the student has been
absent. If there are special reasons, the student's guardian does not need to
be informed on the same day (Chapter 15, Section 16, second paragraph of the Education Act).
The personal data processing that usually takes place to administer students
attendance at school should be considered necessary due to the role of the principals
according to ch. 15 Section 16 of the Education Act and thus constitutes a task of general interest

6 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

pursuant to Article 6 (1) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation. In some parts it can even
there is a legal obligation under Article 6 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation.
According to the preparatory work for the Data Protection Act (Bill 2017/18: 105 New Data Protection Act p.
51), however, increases the requirements for complementary national regulation
regarding precision and predictability when it comes to a more tangible
infringement. It is also stated that if the infringement is significant and involves
monitoring or mapping of the individual's personal circumstances is required
in addition, special legal support according to ch. 6 and 20 §§ form of government.
The Data Inspectorate can state that there is a legal basis for that
administer students' attendance at school, but that there is no explicit
legal support to perform the task through the treatment of sensitive
personal data or in any other way that violates privacy.
Sensitive personal data (Article 9)
The facial recognition that has taken place in the case in question has meant that
Attendance checks have been done by biometric personal data about children
have been processed to uniquely identify these.
According to Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, a processing of
biometric personal data to uniquely identify a natural person a
processing of special categories of personal data (so-called sensitive
personal data). The starting point is that it is forbidden to treat such
tasks. In order to process sensitive personal data, a
exemption from the prohibition under Article 9 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation is applicable.
As stated above, the upper secondary school board has agreed to consent from
the guardians have been given in connection with the current treatments that
supervision refers to.
According to Article 9 (2) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, the processing of sensitive data
personal data may be permitted if the data subject has expressly provided his
consent to the processing of this personal data for one or more
specific purposes, except in the case of Union or national law
the law provides that the prohibition in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject.
As previously reported, there is generally a significant inequality
relationship between the high school board and the students and attendance control is one

7 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

unilateral control measure where this inequality prevails. Consent can therefore not,
as previously stated, is considered to be provided voluntarily within the framework of
school activities. Consent is therefore not possible to apply as an exception
from the ban on the processing of sensitive personal data in the present case.
The Upper Secondary School Board also refers in its opinion to the rules of the Public Administration Act
efficient case management and the school law's rules on handling absence.
It follows from Article 9 (2) (g) of the Data Protection Regulation that the prohibition on processing
sensitive personal data does not apply if the processing is necessary for reasons of consideration
to an important public interest, on the basis of Union law or
national law of the Member States, which shall be proportionate to it
sought purpose, be consistent with the essential content of the right to
data protection and contain provisions on appropriate and specific measures for
to ensure the data subject's fundamental rights and interests.
National supplementary provisions concerning the exemption if important
public interest has i.a. a. introduced in ch. § 3 of the Data Protection Act.3
According to ch. Section 3, first paragraph 2 of the Data Protection Act states that sensitive
personal data may be processed in accordance with Article 9 (2) (g) of the Data Protection Regulation if this is necessary in the interests of the public interest;
and the processing is necessary for the handling of a case.
In the preparatory work (Bill 2017/18: 105 New Data Protection Act) it is stated, among other things. a. the following.
“The Government's view, however, is that the concept of the case in most cases
is relatively clear (see Bill 2016/17: 180 pp. 23–25 and p. 286).
The term is used as a delimitation for the Public Administration Act
scope and should, in the Government's view, also be used

3

Individual school principals' processing of sensitive personal data has
regulated in Chapter 26 a. Section 4 of the Education Act (2010: 800), which corresponds to Chapter 3 § 3
the Data Protection Act. As this supervision refers to a municipal school and it is missing
sector-specific rules regarding the treatment of sensitive
personal data in this type of school activity is ch. Section 3 of the Data Protection Act
applicable.

here. The provision should therefore be applicable in the handling of a
matter. (p. 87) ”
Furthermore, the following is stated in the preparatory work for the Public Administration Act
(Bill 2016/17: 180 A modern and legally secure administration - new administrative law).
The term processing includes all measures taken by an authority
takes from the time a case is initiated until it is closed. The expression
case is not defined in the law. Characteristic of what constitutes a
case is, however, that it is regularly concluded by a statement from
the side of the authority intended to have actual effects on one
recipient in the individual case. A case is closed by a decision of
some kind. In assessing the question of whether an authority
position is to be regarded as a decision in this sense it is
the purpose and content of the statement that determines the nature of the statement, not its
external form (p. 286). "
The Data Inspectorate states that the attendance check that takes place through
facial recognition does not constitute a case handling without it being a question
about an actual action. The provision in ch. § 3 first paragraph 2
The Data Protection Act is therefore not applicable to the processing of personal data
which the upper secondary school board has carried out in connection with face recognition
attendance control of students.
Of ch. 3 Section 3, first paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act states that sensitive
personal data may be processed by an authority if the data has been provided
to the authority and the processing is required by law. Regarding this
provision appears, among other things. a. the following of the preparatory work (prop.2017 / 18: 105 New
data protection law).
“The provision clarifies that it is permitted for authorities to perform
such processing of sensitive personal data as is required in
the activities of the authorities as a direct consequence of, above all
the provisions of the Public Access and Secrecy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act
on how public documents are to be handled, for example by requiring
record keeping and obligation to receive e-mail. Treatment of sensitive

9 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

personal data on the basis of this paragraph may only be made about the data
has been submitted to the authority. (p. 194) ”
The Data Inspectorate states that ch. Section 3, first paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act
is not relevant for the current processing of personal data.
According to ch. Section 3, first paragraph 3 of the Data Protection Act, authorities may also in other respects
case process sensitive personal data if the processing is necessary with
consideration of an important public interest and does not unduly infringe
the personal integrity of the data subject.
In the preparatory work (Bill 2017/18: 105 New Data Protection Act) it is stated, among other things. a. the following.
"The provision is not intended to be applied casually in it
ongoing operations. It is required that the data controller, in it
individual case, make an assessment of whether the treatment involves one
undue invasion of the data subject's privacy. If
the treatment would involve such an infringement, it may not take place in accordance with
this provision. To determine if the intrusion is improper must
the authority to make a proportionality assessment where the need to
carry out the processing is weighted against the data subjects' interest in
the treatment does not take place. The assessment of the data subjects' interest in
the treatment does not take place should be based on the interest of privacy protection that
the registrants typically have. The personal data controller must
thus not making an assessment in relation to each individual concerned. At
the assessment of the invasion of the individual's personal integrity shall be important
added to i.a. the sensitivity of the data, the nature of the processing, the
attitude the data subjects can be assumed to have to the processing, the spread
the information may be obtained and the risk of further processing for others
purpose than the collection purpose. This means e.g. that the provision
can not be used as a basis for creating privacy-sensitive
compilations of sensitive personal data. (p. 194) ”.
Attendance management is a comprehensive and central task in the school system and
takes place casually in the day-to-day operations. The Data Inspectorate
therefore considers that ch. § 3 first paragraph 3 of the Data Protection Act can not
applied to the personal data processing that takes place for attendance management.
The provision can thus not be applied to the personal data processing

1 0 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

which the upper secondary school board has carried out. In addition, the Data Inspectorate considers that they
the current personal data processing has entailed an undue invasion of
the privacy of the registered as the high school board through camera surveillance in
the students' everyday environment has processed sensitive personal data concerning
children who are in a dependent position in relation to
the upper secondary school board for the purpose of attendance management.
Against this background, the Data Inspectorate finds that the national
supplementary provisions concerning the exemption in 9.2 g i
the Data Protection Ordinance on important public interest which has been introduced in ch. 3
§ first paragraph of the Data Protection Act are not applicable to those
personal data processing covered by this supervision.
In addition, it appears from ch. § 3 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that it is
prohibited from performing searches that take place on the basis of ch. § 3 first paragraph in
purpose of obtaining a selection of persons based on sensitive personal data.
Since the purpose of facial recognition is to identify students, can
The Data Inspectorate states that the attendance check presupposes searches
based on sensitive personal data. The latter means that the current
the treatments covered by this supervision have also been in breach of 3
Cape. Section 3, second paragraph, of the Data Protection Act.
In summary, the Data Inspectorate assesses that the exception in 9.2 g in
the Data Protection Regulation does not apply to the current processing of
personal data. Because what has emerged in the case is not either
means that any of the other exceptions in Article 9 (2) (i)
the Data Protection Ordinance may become relevant, the Data Inspectorate considers that
the upper secondary school board has lacked the conditions to process biometrics
personal data to uniquely identify students for attendance management such as
has been. These personal data processing has thus taken place in violation of
Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Basic principles for the processing of personal data (Article 5)
It can be stated that the personal data controller according to Article 5 (2)
the Data Protection Regulation is responsible for compliance with the Regulation and shall
be able to show that the basic principles are followed.
Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation states, among other things: a. that the personal data shall
collected for specific, explicit and justified purposes and not

1 1 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

later treated in a manner incompatible with those purposes
(purpose limitation). In addition, personal data processed must be
adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to the purposes for which
which they are processed (data minimization). It follows from recital 39 that personal data
may be treated only if the purpose of the treatment can not be achieved on one
satisfactorily with other methods.
On the question of how the upper secondary school board has made the proportionality assessment
regarding the current personal data processing, the board has provided
following response in its opinion received on 15 March 2019.
“It is important to have a secure identification to know who the students are
present and meet the requirements contained in the Education Act for action then
students have high absenteeism. The method of face recognition is assessed
needed to know for sure that the presence is registered correctly.
Face recognition is also a clear increase in quality compared to
the previous manual handling which on inspection proved to have deficiencies
in such a way that it is not always correct. Of the various alternative methods
tested, facial recognition was judged to be the best method
meets the requirements both from the legislation and from the purpose of the project. "
The Data Inspectorate has previously found that the personal data processing
which this supervision covers has involved the treatment of sensitive
personal data concerning children who are dependent on i
relation to the upper secondary school board and that these treatments have taken place
through camera surveillance in the students' everyday environment. The Data Inspectorate
assess that these treatments - even if it is a question of relatively few
students and a relatively limited period of time - has meant a large
invasion of student integrity.
The Upper Secondary School Board has stated that the purpose of these treatments has been
attendance control. Attendance control can be done in other ways that are smaller
violating the privacy of students. The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that
the method, to use face recognition via camera for presence control, has
been too extensive and implemented for one for the privacy of
intervening manner and thereby been disproportionate to
the purpose. The Upper Secondary School Board's proceedings have thus been carried out in combat
with Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation.

1 2 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

Impact assessment and prior consultation (Articles 35, 36)
According to Article 35, a data controller shall make an assessment of a
planned processing consequences for the protection of personal data, in particular
whether a treatment is to be carried out with new technology and taking into account its nature,
scope, context and purpose are likely to lead to a high risk of
rights and freedoms of natural persons.
On the question of whether the upper secondary school board has made an impact assessment according to
Article 35 prior to the start of the project in question, the upper secondary school board has in its
response received on 15 March 2019 referred to a risk assessment performed.
The following is clear from the assessment made.
“Face recognition is admittedly biometric data and according to
the Data Protection Regulation sensitive personal data which requires special
decision to be handled. However, the information is not classified either
if they are sensitive. The students' guardians also give their consent
the processing of personal data and there is legal support for
the treatment both in the Public Administration Act and in the Education Act. The handling
described by the provider for handling the sensitive data
such as that there is no mains connection of the equipment that handles
information that only authorized staff have access to
personal data that only the target group is handled, that those who
registered gives his consent and that the data will be deleted after
the test period means that the handling is judged to be within the framework of
the Data Protection Regulation. Overall, no special is required
risk assessment to handle sensitive personal data without what
needed is that the upper secondary school board approves in its register list
the handling of biometric data and also the entry of a
reason to use the data. Head of Administration for
the upper secondary school office has a delegation to make decisions on approval of
handling of personal data and also sensitive personal data. (p. 4) ”.
In its response, the Board also referred to the appendix “Skellefteå municipality -
The classroom of the future ”. The appendix (p. 5) states that an advantage of
face recognition is that it is easy to mass register a large group
such as a class. The disadvantages are stated to be that it is a technically advanced
solution that requires relatively many pictures of each individual as well as that camera

1 3 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

must have a clear view of all students present and that any headgear / shawl
may cause identification to fail.
Article 35 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation states that at least the following shall:
included in an impact assessment. A systematic description of it
planned treatment and the purposes of the treatment, an assessment of the need
of and the proportionality of the treatment in relation to the purposes, a
assessment of the risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms referred to in
paragraph 1, and the measures planned to address the risks, including:
safeguards, security measures and procedures to ensure the protection of
personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, taking into account
to the rights and entitlements of data subjects and other persons concerned
interests.
The Data Inspectorate states that the upper secondary school board has made one
risk assessment. In the risk assessment, it has been concluded that the legal aid
one refers to and the security the treatment is covered by means that no one
special risk assessment needs to be made regarding the sensitive ones
personal data.
According to the Data Inspectorate's assessment, the current treatments have
included a number of factors that suggest that an impact assessment according to
Article 35 should have been done before the proceedings began. The treatments have
happened with camera surveillance which is a systematic surveillance and they have
included sensitive personal data about children in an environment in which they are
dependency. Face recognition is also a new technology. Requirements for one
impact assessment under Article 35 can therefore be based on those assessments
which preceded the current use.
The Data Inspectorate assesses that the high school board's risk assessment
reported lacks an assessment of the risks that exist for them
registered rights and freedoms as well as a statement of
the proportionality of the treatment in relation to its purposes why the requirements
in Article 35 can not be considered fulfilled.
According to Article 36 of the Data Protection Regulation, a personal data controller shall:
consult with the regulatory authority on an impact assessment
data protection under Article 35 shows that the processing would lead to a high risk
unless the data controller takes measures to reduce the risk.

1 4 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

Based on what has emerged in the case, the upper secondary school board has not
submitted a prior consultation to the Data Inspectorate. The inspection
assesses that there have been a number of factors that make it high
risk to individuals' rights and freedoms with the treatments. For example
these treatments include new technology relating to sensitive personal data
concerning children who are dependent on the upper secondary school board
and that these treatments have taken place through camera surveillance in the students'
everyday environment. Because the risk assessment the high school board has provided
lacks an assessment of current risks to data subjects' rights and
freedoms with the treatments, the upper secondary school board has also not been able to show
that the high risk provided for in Article 36 has been reduced. The Data Inspectorate states
because the current treatments should have caused one
prior consultation with the Data Inspectorate in accordance with Article 36 before processing
initiated. The proceedings have thus also taken place in breach of Article 36.
Permit according to the Camera Surveillance Act
The Camera Surveillance Act contains national provisions regarding camera surveillance which, in accordance with section 1, supplement the Data Protection Ordinance. Of § 2
The Camera Surveillance Act states that the purpose of the law is to meet the need
of camera surveillance for legitimate purposes and to protect natural persons
against undue invasion of privacy during such surveillance.
The definition of camera surveillance in section 3 of the Camera Surveillance Act entails
among other things that it must be a question of equipment used on such
means involving permanent or regular repeated personal surveillance.
According to section 7 of the Camera Surveillance Act, a permit for camera surveillance of a person is required
place to which the public has access, if the surveillance is to be conducted by one
authority.
The Data Inspectorate states that this has been a permanent and regular issue
repeated personal surveillance when the upper secondary school board has used
camera surveillance with face recognition technology in conjunction with its
attendance control projects over a three-week period.
The Upper Secondary School Board is an authority and must therefore be based on it
permission to camera-monitor a place to which the public has access. The question is
then if the public is considered to have access to the place provided by the upper secondary school board

1 5 (20)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-2221

camera-monitored using facial recognition technology in
in connection with the registration of students' attendance. Practice shows that the concept
"Place where the public has access" must be interpreted broadly (see Högsta
the decision of the Administrative Court RÅ 2000 ref. 52).
In general, a school is considered a place to which the public does not have access,
however, there are certain areas of a school where it is believed that the public has
access. Examples of such areas are main entrances and corridors such as
leads to the principal's office. The investigation shows that the students
were registered using face recognition each time they entered one
classroom. A classroom is not to be considered a place where the public has
access.
In the light of what has emerged about the location of the surveillance assess
The Data Inspectorate that it is not a question of a place where the public has
access. There is thus no requirement to apply for a permit. To
However, the camera surveillance is unlicensed does not have to mean that it is one
permitted surveillance. If camera surveillance includes
personal data processing, the data protection rules must be followed, e.g. the obligation to
clearly inform about the camera surveillance.
Risk that the regulations will be violated in the event of planned further treatment
Based on what has emerged in the case, the upper secondary school board has considered
to re-process personal data in the future through face recognition
for attendance control of students. The Data Inspectorate has found above that
the upper secondary school board's proceedings have been in violation of Articles 5 and 9
the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that
the upper secondary school board risks violating the said provisions even at
planned treatments.

Choice of intervention
Article 58 of the Data Protection Regulation lists all the powers that:
The Data Inspectorate has. According to Article 58 (2), the Data Inspectorate has a number
corrective powers, e.g. a. warnings, reprimands or restrictions
of treatment.

According to Article 58 (2) (i) of the Data Protection Regulation,
the supervisory authority shall impose administrative penalty fees in accordance with
with Article 83. Pursuant to Article 83 (2), administrative penalty fees,
depending on the circumstances of the individual case, applied in addition to or in
instead of the measures referred to in Article 58 (2) (a) to (h) and (j)
Article 83 (2) (n) the factors to be taken into account in administrative decisions
penalty fees in general shall be imposed and in determining
the size of the fee.
Instead of penalty fees, in certain cases according to recital 148 to
data protection regulation a reprimand is issued instead of penalty fees
if it is a matter of a minor infringement. However, consideration must be given
circumstances such as the nature of the infringement, the severity and
duration.
For authorities under Article 83 (7), national supplementary
provisions are introduced regarding administrative sanction fees. Of ch. 6 § 2
The Data Protection Act states that the supervisory authority may charge a penalty fee
by an authority in the event of infringements referred to in Article 83 (4), 83 (5) and 83 (6) i
the Data Protection Regulation. In that case, Article 83 (1), (2) and (3) of the Regulation shall apply
apply.
Penalty fee
The Data Inspectorate has above assessed that the upper secondary school board in the relevant
the processing of personal data has infringed Article 5, Article 9, Article 35
and Article 36 of the Data Protection Regulation. These articles are covered by article
83.4 and 83.5 and in the event of a violation of these, the supervisory authority shall
consider imposing an administrative penalty fee in addition to, or instead of,
other corrective actions.
In view of the fact that the personal data processing provided by this supervision
has involved the processing of sensitive personal data concerning children
who is in a dependent relationship with the upper secondary school board and that
these treatments have taken place through camera surveillance in the students' everyday lives
environment, it is not a matter of a minor infringement. There is thus no reason
to replace the penalty fee with a reprimand.

No other corrective action is relevant for that treatment either
as happened. The Upper Secondary School Board must thus be charged with administrative
penalty fees.
Determination of the amount of the sanction
According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall:
ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual
cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
According to Article 83 (3), the administrative penalty fee may not exceed
the amount of the most serious infringement in the case of one or the same
data processing or interconnected data processing.
For authorities, according to ch. 6 § 2 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that
the penalty fees shall be set at a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 at
infringements referred to in Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation and up to
SEK 10,000,000 in the event of infringements referred to in Article 83 (5) and (6).
Violations of Articles 5 and 9 are subject to the higher penalty fee
under Article 83 (5), while infringements of Articles 35 and 36 are covered by it
lower maximum amount in accordance with Article 83 (4). In this case, it is a question of the same
data processing, which is why the amount may not exceed SEK 10 million.
Article 83. 2 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out all the factors that must
taken into account when determining the size of the penalty fee. In the assessment of
the size of the penalty fee shall include a. account is taken of Article 83 (2) (a)
(nature, severity and duration of the infringement), b (intent or
negligence), g (categories of personal data), h (how the breach came about
The Data Inspectorate's knowledge) and k (other aggravating or mitigating
factor such as direct or indirect financial gain)
the Data Protection Regulation.
In the Data Inspectorate's assessment of the penalty fee, account has been taken of the fact that
there have been infringements concerning several articles of the Data Protection Regulation,
whereby infringement of Articles 5 and 9 is to be judged as more serious and
covered by the higher penalty fee. Furthermore, it has been taken into account that
the violation has concerned sensitive personal data, concerning children who have been
in a position of dependence in relation to the upper secondary school board. The treatments have
has taken place to streamline operations, the treatment has thus taken place
intentionally. These circumstances are aggravating.

Account has also been taken of the fact that the treatment has taken place
The Data Inspectorate's knowledge via information in the media.
Mitigating circumstances take into account that the treatment has been ongoing during
a limited period of three weeks and has only included 22 students.
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that
The upper secondary school board in Skellefteå municipality must pay an administrative fee
penalty fee of SEK 200,000.

a personal data controller or personal data assistant if planned

use face recognition for student attendance. These
treatments will similarly violate the provisions of
the Data Protection Regulation. Due to the risk of future violations in
in connection with the planned treatments, a warning is now given in accordance with
