The Data Inspectorate's decision
The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University


has sent sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data through
unencrypted e-mail and via open network to the Police Authority on 5
February 2019. The university has therefore processed personal data in
contrary to Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation1 by not having taken appropriate technical measures
measures to ensure an appropriate level of safety in
relation to the risk.



has not reported the personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate and
not documented the circumstances surrounding the incident then
the university became aware of it. The university has therefore
acted in breach of Article 33 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Regulation.



in the processing of sensitive and privacy-sensitive personal data
in the cloud service Box, during the period May 25, 2018 to spring 2019, no
have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to:
prevent unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to
personal data. The university has therefore treated
personal data in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation.

Administrative penalty fee
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of Articles 58 (2) and 83 i
the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act (2018: 218) to Umeå
the university must pay an administrative sanction fee of SEK 550,000.

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General
Data Protection Regulation).

Report on the supervisory matter
Background
The Data Inspectorate began inspecting Umeå University on 29 August 2019.
The inspectorate had received information that the university had sent sensitive
personal data to the Police Authority via unencrypted e-mail. To
the information was attached to the Police Authority's letter; Information about
shortcomings in handling documents.
The purpose of the supervision is to investigate whether the personal data processing as
described in the Police Authority's letter meets the requirements for security as
set out in Articles 5.1.f and 32 of the Data Protection Regulation.
The Data Inspectorate has also examined whether Umeå University has followed
the provision of Article 33 of the Data Protection Regulation, as inter alia
is about the personal data controller's obligation to report to a
personal data incident.
Furthermore, the Data Inspectorate has investigated the handling of sensitive
personal data in the cloud service Box made in accordance with
data protection rules.
The Data Inspectorate's supervision will take effect from 25 May 2018 then
the Data Protection Regulation came into force. The inspection therefore has not
examined the incident that occurred before that date.
The supervision has been carried out through written communication.
What has emerged in the case
Letter from the police authority
The Police Authority's letter states, among other things, the following.
A research group at Umeå University requested all of them
preliminary investigation report concerning rape against men in Sweden from 2014.
On 18 July 2016, the Police Authority released the documents by courier.

Page 3 of 23

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

In connection with a request for supplementation via email attached
research group, 19 November 2017, unintentionally one of the
preliminary investigation report previously issued by the Police Authority. The police authority then contacted the research group and pointed out the inappropriateness of
to send sensitive material over unprotected email channels. The research group
regretted what had happened and referred to the human factor.
In connection with another request for supplementation attached
the research group, on 5 February 2019, again the same
preliminary investigation report. When the Police Authority contacted once again
the research group about this was admitted that this time too it was unintentional
attached the sensitive material in an email.
Information from Umeå University
Umeå University was responsible for personal data when the email was sent to
The police authority.
The principal researcher left his employment at Umeå University
on 31 August 2018 for employment at Uppsala University. Because it
the principal researcher changed employer and the workplace has the project
also changed residence. However, this happened after the current events.
The financier Forte2 decided to change the principal on 13 March 2019 and
The Ethics Review Authority approved the change, which involved a change
research principal at Uppsala University on 10 May 2019.
The research project at Umeå University has been approved by
The ethics review authority and the preliminary investigation protocols have been received
and stored on the basis of a public interest that allows
personal data processing.
The course of events
In August 2016, the research group received the preliminary investigation protocols that
requested. The documents were sent in paper form to Umeå University.
All police reports and preliminary investigation reports from 2014
scanned in and stored on a password-protected file surface. A physical version
locked in an archive room. The preliminary investigation protocols contain information
2

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

about, among other things, suspicion of crime, name, social security number and
contact information. In addition, these protocols contain information on
sexual life and health, ie sensitive personal data.
In a request for supplementation made in 2017, the intention was not to
attach the minutes among the other documents sent to
The police authority. After what happened, the research group has, among other things, introduced
a routine of scanning sensitive material separately.
The research group has not been able to explain why the group, on 5 February 2019,
once again attached the minutes in an email to the Police Authority.
Security when sending out the preliminary investigation protocols
The incorrect handling has been limited to two occasions. Otherwise have
project routines to lock in physical documents, to separate administrative
documents from research data and to password protect digital documents
followed. Only two researchers from the university have had access to the current
the material.
The university has, among other things, regulations and instructions to ensure
that the processing of personal data at universities complies with the requirements set out in
Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation. The university has had a clear since 2014
rule that sensitive personal data may not be sent by e-mail, in accordance
with the document E-mail service at Umeå University. Employees get
continuous training and information on the subject. The university is also planning
to direct a special information effort on the processing of personal data in
e-mail to all employees at the university.
The university has made a mistake by sending sensitive
personal data via e-mail to the Police Authority.
The personal data processing in question can therefore not be said to meet those requirements
provided for appropriate security measures in accordance with Article 32 of
the Data Protection Regulation.
The personal data incident
Umeå University became aware that sensitive personal data had been sent
by e-mail in connection with the authority receiving the Data Inspectorate's
letter of supervision, 30 August 2019.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

On September 2, 2019, the university conducted an analysis of the events and
then came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that the personal data incident would
may pose a risk to data subjects. The university has
documented the events in the Data Inspectorate's form for reporting
personal data incident. The university has stated in the form, among other things
following.
The university has decided that no report should be submitted to the Data Inspectorate. (…) The 2nd
September, a registered letter was received from the Swedish Data Inspectorate containing information about
the incidents. Umeå University's assessment is that it is unlikely that the incident resulted
high risk to individuals' freedoms and rights. There is no indication that anyone has occurred
actual damage or that any unauthorized person has accessed the information when the protocol in question has
sent to the authority that established it and to the administrator who had the task
to handle and provide the university with the same type of information.

Storage and access in the cloud service Box
The university has scanned in 108 preliminary examination protocols from 2014 as
saved locally on a personal computer and then uploaded to
cloud service provider Box.
The user can access the stored data in Box by logging in
via a web interface internally via the university's network with
single factor authentication (ie username and password).
It is also possible to log in externally via the internet on the university's website
umu.se. The login then takes place via any equipment / network. The user states
first their email address and then their college ID (username) and
password.
User accounts in Box are integrated and linked to university ID as in
in turn are integrated with SWAMID. With SWAMID, a safe is obtained
identification because passwords are neither saved nor sent to Box.
The authentication takes place before, by sending a "ticket" to Box som
confirms the authorization.
All communication is encrypted with 256 bit SSL encryption (https).
All information is stored with 256-bit encryption. This means that
the information is not available if someone without authorization would have access

Page 6 of 23

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

to it. Backups are also encrypted. Box stores the encryption keys separately
from data.
The research project includes two researchers and only the two have had
access to and access to the file area provided by Box. Since
access has been restricted, no special procedures have been established.
The university has a personal data assistant agreement with SUNET (Swedish
University computer Network) which, among other things, applies to storage of
preliminary investigation protocols. SUNET has in turn hired the Deputy Assistant Box.
Box stores the information in the United States and is connected to the Privacy Shield and has
signed binding corporate regulations.
The preliminary investigation protocols are covered by secrecy in accordance with ch. § 1 and 11
Cape. Section 3 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009: 400), OSL. Starting point
is thus that confidentiality applies to the information.
Information that sensitive personal data should not be stored in Box has
published on the university's intranet in September 2016.
The university has made the assessment that there are legal and
safety conditions for storing both sensitive and
confidential information in Box. However, the university has in connection with its
risk and vulnerability analysis for precautionary reasons judged that this should not happen.
The university has assessed that the file surface maintains a satisfactory level of safety.
The assessment has been based on security measures such as access, access and
authorization and security in communication.

Justification of decision
Applicable rules
The responsibility of the personal data controller
The Data Protection Regulation is the primary legal regulation in processing
of personal data.

Page 7 of 23

7 (23)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

The person responsible for personal data is responsible for being able to show that they
the basic principles of Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation are complied with (Article
5.2).
The person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate technical information
and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that
the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall
carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment
and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for
freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated
if necessary. This is stated in Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Legal basis
Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation states the following.
A treatment is only legal if one of the conditions specified in the article is
met (paragraph 1).
A processing is legal if it is necessary to perform a task of
public interest (paragraph 1 (e)). Research purposes are considered a task of
public interest.
The task of general interest must be established in accordance with Union law
or national law (paragraph 3). For state universities and colleges are
the research task established in ch. the Higher Education Act (1992: 1434).
As a general rule, it is forbidden to process sensitive personal data
for example, personal data on health and sexual life. However, there are a number
derogation from the prohibition in Article 9 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. Of Article 9 (2) j
in the Data Protection Regulation it follows that the processing must be necessary for
research purposes and shall be subject to appropriate safeguard measures for it
rights and freedoms of data subjects in accordance with Article 89 (1) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation.
In addition, the exemption from this prohibition requires that national law contain
provisions on appropriate and specific measures to ensure it
registered privacy. One is established in the Ethics Review Act3
3

The Act (2003: 460) on ethical review.

DI-2019-9432

appropriate and specific action required in the treatment of sensitive
personal data for research purposes. Also provisions on secrecy in
OSL is an example of such an appropriate and special measure.
Article 89 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out specific conditions for processing
of personal data for research purposes. It states that
the treatment shall be subject to appropriate protective measures in accordance with
Regulation.
The requirement for security in the processing of personal data
A basic principle for the processing of personal data is the requirement
security in accordance with Article 5 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, which states that:
personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate
security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized use
treatment and against loss, destruction or damage by accident,
using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
It follows from Article 32 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation that
the person responsible for personal data and the personal data assistant shall take appropriate steps
technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security
which is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment. That too
taking into account recent developments, implementation costs and
the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment and the risks, of
varying degrees of probability and severity, for the rights of natural persons and
freedoms.
When assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration shall be given to them
risks posed by the treatment, in particular from unintentional or illegal
destruction, loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized
access to the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise
treated. This is stated in Article 32 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Recital 75 of the Data Protection Regulation states that various factors must be taken into account in
the assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Among
otherwise, personal data covered by the duty of confidentiality, data on
health or sexual life. Furthermore, consideration must be given to whether the treatment applies
personal data about vulnerable natural persons, in particular children, or about
the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large
number of registered.

Recitals 39 and 83 also provide guidance on the more detailed meaning of
the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation for security in the processing of
personal data.
If the personal data controller hires a personal data assistant to
carry out a processing, the data controller shall only use
personal data assistants who provide sufficient guarantees to implement
appropriate technical and organizational measures. It should be done in such a way
that the processing meets the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation and that it
data subjects' rights are protected. It is clear from Article 28 (1) and recital 81 in the preamble
the Data Protection Regulation. These provisions also state how the relationship
between the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall be regulated.
Obligation to report and document personal data incidents
According to Article 4 (12) of the Data Protection Regulation, a personal data incident is a
safety incident leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or
change or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the
personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed. According to
Article 29 Group Guidance WP2504 may be unauthorized or illegal
processing include the disclosure of personal data (or access to
these) to recipients who are not authorized to receive (or access)
the data, or any other form of processing that is contrary to
the Data Protection Regulation.
Article 33 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation states that
the person responsible for personal data, in the event of a personal data incident, must report
the incident to the supervisory authority without undue delay, and if so
possible not later than 72 hours after learning of it. If it is
it is unlikely that the personal data incident entails a risk to natural persons
rights and freedoms need not be notified. About one
the person responsible for personal data does not act quickly and it becomes obvious that one

Article 29 - Working Party on Data Protection, WP250rev.01; Guidelines for notification of
personal data incidents according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679; adopted on 3 October 2017; last
reviewed and adopted on February 6, 2018; adopted by the European Data Protection Board, EDPB,
during the first plenary session on 25 May 2018; pp. 11–12. The working group was set up
pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 95/46 / EC and was an independent EU advisory body in matters
concerning data protection and privacy.

incident has taken place, this can be considered as a failure to act in
in accordance with Article 335.
The following is stated in recital 85.
A personal data incident that is not quickly remedied appropriately can for natural persons
lead to physical, material or intangible damage, such as loss of control over one's own
personal data or to limit their rights, discrimination, identity theft
or fraud, financial loss, unauthorized revocation of pseudonym, damage to reputation,
loss of confidentiality in respect of personal data covered by the obligation of professional secrecy, or
to another economic or social detriment to the natural person concerned. As soon as one
personal data controller becomes aware that a personal data incident has occurred, it should
personal data controllers therefore report the personal data incident to the supervisory authority
without undue delay and, if possible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of
this, unless the person responsible for personal data, in accordance with the principle of responsibility, can demonstrate that
it is unlikely that the personal data incident will entail a risk of physical
rights and freedoms of persons.

According to the Article 29 Working Party, a data controller shall be deemed to have received
knowledge of the incident when the data controller is reasonably certain
that a security incident has taken place which has resulted in personal data
endangered. The data controller shall, in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation,
take all appropriate technical protective measures and all appropriate organizational
measures to immediately determine whether a personal data incident has taken place
room and promptly inform the supervisory authority and the data subjects.
Recital 87 of the Data Protection Regulation states the importance of being able to establish one
incident, assess the risk to individuals and then report the incident if so
required.
Article 33 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation regulates the obligation to:
document personal data incidents. The person responsible for personal data shall
document all personal data incidents, regardless of whether the incident should
reported to the Data Inspectorate or not. The documentation must contain
information about the circumstances surrounding the personal data incident, its
effects and the corrective measures taken. The documentation must
enable the supervisory authority to monitor compliance with
Article 33 of the Data Protection Regulation.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

The documentation obligation in Article 33 (5) is also linked to
liability in Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, ie
the person responsible for personal data must be responsible for and be able to show that they
the basic principles of data protection are complied with. There is also one
link between Article 33 (5) and the provision on liability for
data controller in accordance with Article 24 of the Data Protection Regulation.6
It may be added that the Article 29 Working Party's guidelines state that it
personal data controllers need to have routines to detect and remedy
incidents involving personal data, which is the meaning of Article 33 (5).
In addition, it shows the ability to quickly detect, remedy and report
an incident should be seen as important elements in the appropriate technical and
organizational measures referred to in Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Transfer of personal data to third countries
Chapter V of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the possibilities for:
transfer personal data to a third country (a country outside the EEA).
Personal data may be transferred if the European Commission has decided to do so
there is an adequate level of protection in the recipient country or if there is one
appropriate safeguards, for example through contractual clauses or binding
company regulations.7
For recitals 101 and 116 of the Data Protection Regulation, the risk is emphasized when
personal data are transferred to countries outside the Union and the importance of:
the level of protection will not be lower in such transfers. This is especially true in
question of the protection against unauthorized use or unauthorized disclosure of
this information. Furthermore, the person responsible for personal data and
the personal data assistant's responsibility to ensure that the regulation is complied with.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
Personal data responsibility
The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University is
personal data controller for the processing of personal data that

updated in the case until the project was transferred to Uppsala
university in the spring of 2019.
Processing of personal data in unencrypted e-mail and open network
The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University, within the framework of
research project, has sent a preliminary investigation report concerning
rapes of men in an unencrypted e-mail via an open network to
The police authority. Something that the university has also admitted.
The preliminary examination report contains information on health and sexual life
which are sensitive personal data. Processing of sensitive personal data can
involve significant risks to personal integrity and are therefore required
strong protection in the processing of such data.
The preliminary investigation report also contains information on suspicion
about crimes and social security numbers that are so-called privacy-sensitive
personal data. The processing of this type of personal data is therefore off
such that the data must have strong protection. That means if about these
personal data sent by e-mail, they must be protected in such a way that
unauthorized persons cannot take part in them. Personal data can, for example
protected by encryption.
Sending information with unencrypted e-mail means that other than that
the intended recipient can access the information in the e-mail. Thus
it is not ensured that only the intended recipient takes part
personal data.
The university has also sent the personal data via an open network. One
open network, such as the internet, is characterized by others being able to take part in it
information communicated on the network. This means that unauthorized persons have been able to
gain access to the personal data transferred by the university.
As the person responsible for personal data, Umeå University must ensure that the technical and
the organizational measures ensure a level of security that is appropriate in
in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which
the treatment entails (Article 32 (1)). The personal data that is processed must
for example, protected against unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access.
What is the appropriate level of safety varies according to the risks,
the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. At

Page 13 of 23

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

the assessment must therefore, for example, take into account what type it is
personal data processed.8
The university must identify the possible risks for those registered
rights and freedoms and assess the likelihood of risks occurring
and the consequences in such cases.
In this case, it is a question of both sensitive and privacy-sensitive ones
personal data. Processing this type of data requires a strong
protection based on the nature of the treatment.
Overall, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University has processed
personal data in violation of the Data Protection Ordinance by the University
have not taken appropriate technical safety measures to protect
the personal data in the e-mail based on the sensitivity of the data and
how they were communicated unencrypted over open network. The treatment has therefore
in breach of Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation.
The personal data incident should have been documented and reported
According to Umeå University, the university became aware of being sensitive
personal data sent via unencrypted e-mail by the university
received the Data Inspectorate's supervisory letter on 30 August 2019. According to
the university also documented the incident, on September 2, 2019, in
The Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incidents.
As regards the knowledge of the incident, the Data Inspectorate states that it is off
The police authority's letter dated 3 April 2019, states that
The police authority in contact with the university pointed out the inappropriateness of that
send sensitive personal information via unencrypted e-mail. The Data Inspectorate
therefore considers that the university must have become aware of the current situation
the incident before 30 August 2019 and at least no later than 3 April 2019.
With regard to the documentation, the Data Inspectorate thus finds that
the university did not document the circumstances surrounding
the personal data incident immediately after becoming aware of it. This
makes it difficult to monitor compliance with Article 33 of the
8

See recitals 75 and 76 of the Data Protection Regulation.

Page 14 of 23

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

the Data Protection Regulation. That the university has subsequently filled in
The Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incidents changes
not the assessment that the university should have documented the incident already
when the Police Authority contacted the university.
Furthermore, the Swedish Data Inspectorate states that the university has not been admitted
with a report of a personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate. According to
the university was due to the fact that it was unlikely that the incident would
entail a high risk for individuals' freedoms and rights. The Data Inspectorate wants
emphasize that there is always a risk that unauthorized persons may take part in it
the personal data if it is sent unencrypted via the open network. As
The Data Inspectorate previously stated that the mailing applies to both sensitive and
privacy-sensitive personal data. The risk for the data subjects' freedom and
rights are therefore high if this type of personal data is processed in one
in such a way that they, for example, benefit from unauthorized persons.
All in all, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University has failed
to act in accordance with Article 33 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Storage of sensitive personal data in a cloud service in third countries
Umeå University has used the cloud service Box to store 108
preliminary investigation report on rape of men.
A cloud service is an Internet-based IT service provided by an external party
supplier. The service can include storage but also other functions, there
these are wholly or to some extent outside the internal operations of the company
it environment9. In this case, the storage is outside the university's internal IT environment. Via the personal data assistant SUNET, Umeå University is hired
Deputy Assistant Box.
The Data Protection Regulation does not only require that it
the person responsible for personal data shall ensure appropriate security for
personal data. The regulation also requires that it
the person responsible for personal data ensures that the personal data assistant fulfills one
security level when processing personal data for it
on behalf of the data controller.

The person responsible for personal data is also responsible for ensuring that the person who
the personal data assistant in turn hires meets the requirements in
the Data Protection Regulation.
Box is supplied by a US company that stores the information in the US.
According to the university, Box was connected to the Privacy Shield and had signed
binding corporate rules.
Personal data may be transferred to third countries only if the conditions in Chapter V of
the Data Protection Regulation are complied with. This applies provided that it
the personal data controller and the personal data assistant can ensure that it
the level of protection afforded to natural persons by the Regulation is not undermined.
According to a decision by the European Commission10, it has been allowed for
personal data controllers in the EU to transfer personal data to recipients who
has joined the Privacy Shield.
In the so-called Schrems II case11 of 16 July 2020, however
The European Court of Justice that the Privacy Shield agreement between the EU and the US does not provide
adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred to the United States. The
means that EU data controllers are no longer allowed to:
with the support of Privacy Shield transfer personal data to the United States.
The Schrems II target may also affect transfers of
personal data that takes place with the help of binding company regulations. The
as the legislation of a third country may affect the protection afforded
through these provisions. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it is
personal data controller who must assess the level of protection required according to
EU law is complied with in the third country concerned.
The Data Inspectorate states that Umeå University ceased to process
the current personal data in the cloud service Box in the spring of 2019. Then it was
allowed by the European Commission decision to transfer personal data to the United States

case stating that Box is said to have been connected to the Privacy Shield
at that time and that the treatment at the university had ended before
The Schrems II goal.
In addition to the person responsible for personal data having support to transfer
personal data to third countries, the person responsible for personal data is also responsible
for the personal data assistant to process the data in a way that
ensures adequate security.
That personal data, like the personal data assistant, is located in a third country
may increase the risk that natural persons will not be able to exercise their
data protection rights, in particular to protect against unauthorized access
use or unauthorized disclosure of this information.12
In this case, it is a matter of information that is protected by confidentiality.
In order to be allowed to process sensitive personal data, the Data Protection Ordinance sets
requirement that national law contain provisions on appropriate
and special measures. The provisions on secrecy to protect it
individuals is such regulation that protects the integrity of individuals in handling
of public documents.13 This means that secrecy is one
privacy protection measure such as the personal data controller and
the personal data assistant has to follow. When the personal data is stored with a
actor who is not covered by secrecy, this means weaker privacy protection
for the data, as a statutory duty of confidentiality that is
punitive sanctions provide stronger protection than an agreed duty of confidentiality.14
Since Box is an actor that is not covered by OSL, the personal data is given one
weaker privacy protection.
There are also technical weaknesses in the selected storage.
To gain access to the preliminary examination protocols in Box, the university has
used a so-called single factor authentication. In this case, college ID
(username and password.

The authentication is used so that the person responsible for personal data can see
that only authorized users have access to personal data.
Single-factor authentication is a weak form of authentication. The risk of someone
can get access to username and password is great. Besides, it is not
surely the one who has been robbed will discover that this has happened
if someone comes across username and password through for example so
called phishing.
Stronger authentication should make it harder for unauthorized people to get over them
necessary login information needed to be able to authenticate.
Stronger authentication can be achieved by using more than one
factor (something you know, something you have and something you are). For example, can
"Something you know" can be a username or password, "something you have" can
be a smart card or mobile phone and "something you are" can be one
fingerprints or facial features.
The user can access the stored data in Box by logging in
via a web interface internally via the university's network with
single factor authentication (ie username and password). The
can also log in externally via the internet on the university's website umu.se.
The login then takes place via optional equipment and optional network and the user
first states his e-mail address and then his college ID (username)
and password (that is, with single-factor authentication).
Because access to the current data can be via the open network is
the exposure area to unauthorized persons is very large, which entails the risk of
the data will unauthorized to part increases.
Umeå University has stated that the communication and storage of
the information in the preliminary investigation protocols has been encrypted in Box.
However, the Data Inspectorate does not consider that this means that the information is
adequately protected against unauthorized access. For example, it may be illegal
come across usernames and passwords pretending to be authorized and thus
take part of the information in clear text.
As previously stated, the person responsible for personal data must ensure a suitable one
safety in relation to the risk of treatment. This also applies when

the personal data is processed by a personal data assistant. The
personal data controllers must therefore make an assessment of the risks that
may occur during treatment. When the personal data controller
processes personal data in a cloud service, the person in charge needs to implement
a suitability assessment that includes a risk analysis. That way, it gets
personal data controller a basis for being able to make decisions about which
appropriate technical and organizational measures that are needed or should be
required by the personal data assistant. It also provides the person responsible for personal data
an opportunity to ensure an appropriate level of security.
When assessing the security level when storing and transferring
personal data shall be given special consideration if the processing entails a risk of
unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access.
Umeå University has stated that the university in connection with its risk and
vulnerability analysis judged that sensitive personal data should not be stored in Box
for precautionary reasons. This information was published at the university
intranet in September 2016. Despite the university scanned in
pre-investigation protocols and stored them in Box.
The preliminary investigation protocols concern rapes against men and personal data
in them are both sensitive and privacy-sensitive. The information is covered
in addition to secrecy. The Data Inspectorate's assessment is that the processing of
this type of personal data involves a high risk to the privacy of individuals
if the personal data is disclosed or if an unauthorized person gains access to it.
The treatment is therefore of such a nature that it requires a high level of safety.
The Data Inspectorate states that it has been a question of a treatment of
personal data in a cloud service in the United States that is not covered by the regulations
in OSL, and that security has not been high enough to prevent
unauthorized access to the data. In addition, the Data Inspectorate states
that the university in 2016 assessed that the processing of sensitive personal data
in Box was not appropriate.
In summary, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University does not have
have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent
unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the sensitive and
privacy-sensitive personal data stored in Box. The university has
thereby not ensuring a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to

Page 19 of 23

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-9432

the risk of processing the personal data in question in the case.
Umeå University has thus processed the personal data in violation of
Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Choice of intervention
Legal regulation
In the event of violations of the Data Protection Ordinance, the Data Inspectorate has a number
corrective powers, including reprimand, injunction and
penalty fees. It follows from Article 58 (2) (a) to (j) of the Data Protection Regulation.
The Data Inspectorate shall impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of
other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2),
the circumstances of each individual case.
Member States may lay down rules on whether and to what extent
administrative penalty fees may be imposed on public authorities.
This is stated in Article 83 (7) of the Regulation. Sweden has accordingly
decided that the Data Inspectorate shall be allowed to charge sanction fees by authorities.
For violations of, among other things, Articles 32 and 33, the fee shall amount to
a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. For infringements of, inter alia, Article 5 i
According to the ordinance, the fee shall amount to a maximum of SEK 10,000,000. It appears from
Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Article 83 (4) and (5) i
the Data Protection Regulation.
If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with respect to
on one or the same or interconnected data processing, intentionally
or through negligence violates several of the provisions of this Regulation
the total amount of the administrative penalty fee may not exceed it
amount determined for the most serious infringement. It appears from
Article 83 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative
penalty fees in each individual case are effective, proportionate and
deterrent. This is stated in Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a
administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect
the size of the penalty fee.

The size of the penalty fee
The university has sent a preliminary investigation protocol with personal data
about, among other things, health, sexual life and suspicion of crime via unencrypted email and through open network. The personal data processed is both
sensitive and privacy sensitive and covered by regulations on
secrecy.
The police authority sent the information to the university via courier, which should
made the university aware of the data value of the data. Despite this
failed the university to take appropriate technical safety measures.
The personal data was thus not protected from the risk of being exposed to, among other things
other unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access. The Data Inspectorate finds that
no other assessment can be made than that the infringement took place through
negligence.
In addition, Umeå University has stored a large number, 108 pieces,
preliminary investigation protocols with sensitive and privacy sensitive
personal data in the cloud service Box. This without the university ensuring
an appropriate level of security to be able to store this type of personal data in
Box. The university thus also failed in this part to take appropriate
technical safety measures. The university also did not ensure that
personal data were covered by such appropriate organizational measures
required by the data protection regulations.
Contrary to its own risk and vulnerability analysis, the university stored them
sensitive personal data in Box. The Data Inspectorate considers this to be one
factor that must be taken into account when assessing the size of the penalty fee.
Furthermore, the university has failed to report the personal data incident as
occurred at the time of sending the e-mail to the Data Inspectorate. Nor
the circumstances surrounding the incident were documented when the university became
paid attention to it.
Against this background, the Data Inspectorate finds that Umeå University through
the personal data processing in question has violated Article 5 (1) (f), Article
32 (1) and (2) and Article 33 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Regulation.
The Data Inspectorate therefore considers that Umeå University should be applied
administrative penalty fees for the said infringements.

The Data Inspectorate finds that the treatments via e-mail and storage in
Box refers to two interconnected data processing operations in accordance with Article 83 (3) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation. This is because the treatments are the same
personal data within a research project and refers to violation of the same
provisions, ie Article 5 (1) (f) and 32 (1) and (2) of the Regulation.
When determining the size of the penalty fee, the Data Inspectorate takes into account
the above circumstances and that the administrative penalty fee
shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. That Umeå University does not
has met the security requirements is serious when it comes to personal data
of such a type that the data require strong protection based on the processing
species.
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that Umeå
universities must pay an administrative sanction fee of a total of 550,000
kronor. For the mailing in the e-mail and the storage in the cloud service Box
the university must pay a fee of SEK 450,000. For the university
failure to report the personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate
and for not having documented the incident, the university must pay a fee
of SEK 100,000.
This decision was made by the Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after
presentation by lawyer Linda Hamidi. In handling the case has
lawyer Caroline Cruz Julander participated. At the final processing
The unit managers Katarina Tullstedt and Malin Blixt and the IT security specialists Johan Ma and Ulrika Sundling have participated.
