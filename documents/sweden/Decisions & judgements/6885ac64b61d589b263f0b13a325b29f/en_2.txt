MAG Interactive AB has mainly stated the following. The company first received a request
on deletion of the complainant's account on the company's services on 29 November 2018 (on
first request). Because the request came from a different email address than the one that
linked to the account, the company requested that the complainant return with evidence to
proof of his identity, which the complainant did not do. On May 29, 2019, a new one was added
request for deletion of the complainant's account, but then by post and with the required
evidence to prove the identity of the complainant (the second request). The company deleted
the complainant's information manually on 15 June 2019 in accordance with the request, in addition to the
information needed to show that the request has been processed. Due to oversight
however, the complainant was not informed of the outcome of the request in connection with that

request was processed. It instead took place only in connection with a review before answers in
this supervisory matter, ie on 6 November 2020.
The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it is a
cross-border complaints, the IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation
and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected
regulators have been the data protection authorities in Norway, Ireland, France,
Austria, Denmark, Poland and Germany.

Justification of decision
Applicable regulations
According to Article 12 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller shall:
request without undue delay and in any case no later than one month after
to have received the request to provide the data subject with information on the actions taken
taken in accordance with Article 17. This period may, if necessary, be extended by a further two
months, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number received
requests. The person responsible for personal data must notify the data subject of a
such extension within one month of receipt of the request and state the reasons
to the delay.
According to Article 12 (6), the controller may, if he has reasonable grounds for:
question the identity of the natural person submitting a request under Article 17;
request that additional information necessary to confirm the data subject's
identity is provided.
According to Article 17 (1) (a), the data subject shall have the right of the personal data controller
without undue delay have their personal data deleted and it
the person responsible for personal data shall be obliged to delete without undue delay
personal data if the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which
which they have collected or otherwise treated. According to Article 17 (3) (b), this shall not be the case
apply to the extent that the processing is necessary to comply with a legal
obligation requiring treatment under Union law.
According to Article 57 (1) (f), each supervisory authority in its territory shall be responsible for:
process complaints from a data subject and, where appropriate, investigate the matter
to which the complaint relates.

The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment
Regarding the first request, IMY states that MAG Interactive AB was reasonable
reasons to doubt the identity of the appellant and thus justifiable to request that the appellant
provided further evidence, which the appellant did not do. IMY considers against this
background that the company has not been obliged to take any further measures
due to that request.
With regard to the second request, IMY notes that the company deleted the complainant's
information, in addition to the information required to demonstrate that the request has been processed, within
16 days from the company receiving the request on May 29, 2019. IMY believes that the company has
deleted the complainant's information without undue delay within the meaning of Article
17 Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the company was justified in retaining the information

needed to demonstrate that the request has been processed in accordance with
the Data Protection Regulation.
However, the company first informed the complainant of the outcome of the second request
6 November 2020. Since the personal data controller according to Article 12 (3) without
unnecessary delay and in any case no later than one month after receipt
request, with an exception not applicable here, shall inform the data subject of the
measures taken pursuant to Article 17, MAG Interactive AB has violated Article 12 (3)
the Data Protection Regulation.
The company has stated that the reason why the complainant was not informed of the result
of the request was due to an oversight. According to the company, this was mainly caused by
that the request was handled manually because it was received by mail and that the company normally
handles requests in a system where notifications of actions taken are sent
automatically. Due to what happened, the company has stated that it will see
over their routines so that what happened is not repeated. The company will, among other things, put
set up a separate log for manual cases to ensure that all steps are followed, including
that the user is notified in the manner he has requested.
IMY states that it is of course important that the person responsible for personal data notifies
the data subject on what measures have been taken in connection with his
request, even in cases where the request is fully complied with to the extent that may be required.
In light of the circumstances regarding the infringement that the company has highlighted
- and the measures that the company has stated that it has taken and will take - considers
however, IMY that the substance of the complaint has been investigated to the extent appropriate
Article 57 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Against this background, the case is closed without action.

This decision has been made by Catharina Fernquist, Head of Unit, after a presentation by
lawyer Olle Pettersson.
