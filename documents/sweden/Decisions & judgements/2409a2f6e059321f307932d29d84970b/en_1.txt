mail, but it has not worked either. Against this background, she believes that
the company has breached its obligations under Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Rebtel Networks AB has mainly stated the following.
The company received a request for deletion from the complainant on September 18, 2019. I
subsequently, however, it can be stated that it was not handled as a request for deletion
under the Data Protection Regulation, even if certain data were deleted. This is
the reason for further e-mail in the form of a reminder of a survey for
customer survey has been sent to the complainant. This has happened during the period up to
and with October 1, 2019, that is, not after the deadline of one month as
applies in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation to comply with a request for deletion.
Remaining data was deleted on November 9, 2020, except for those that are
necessary to be able to handle the current supervisory matter. The company informed
complainant about this on 20 November 2020.
Due to this supervisory matter, the company has taken special measures to
strengthen their established processes and procedures for identifying a request under
the Data Protection Regulation. This includes above all that further training of its
customer service agents. The company has further improved its so-called data triggers in its
customer service tools. The company's investigation of the complainant's case showed that it did not
had been flagged as a matter under the Data Protection Regulation as the data application did not
perceived any reference to the Data Protection Regulation in Spanish.
The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it applies
cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation
and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected
regulators have been the data protection authorities in Spain, Germany, Norway,
Italy and France.

The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment
Has there been a breach of the Data Protection Regulation?
The company has stated that the reason for the complainant's request for deletion of the 18th
September 2019 was not handled until November 9, 2020 due to the company not
perceived it as a request for deletion.
In the IMY's view, however, it has been made clear in the request that it
registered wanted to exercise their right to deletion. Because some data was deleted
only on 9 November 2020 did Rebtel Networks AB process personal data in violation
with Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation by not without undue delay first it
9 November 2020 delete the personal data requested by the complainant on 18 November
September 2019. However, the company has been justified in retaining the information needed for
to be able to show that the request has been handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation.
The company has stated that no further e-mails have been sent since October 2, 2019
and that this is within the time limit of one month provided for in Article 12 (3) and (17)
the Data Protection Regulation. However, the company was incorrect in its reply to the complainant on 22
September 2019 stated that the information had been deleted and that the complainant would not receive
a few more mailings. Rebtel Networks AB thereby violates Article 12 (3)
the Data Protection Regulation provided incorrect information on what measures - that the data
had been deleted - which has been taken as a result of the complainant's request.
Despite the fact that the company, on 22 September 2019, informed the complainant that no more emails would be sent about customer satisfaction, the complainant has received four more
such mailings. The four mailings were made on 22 and 25 September and on 1 and 2
October 2019. However, the IMY notes that this is a relatively short time after that
request for deletion was made and considers that it is within the time limit
the company had undertaken to take action if the request had been handled correctly.

Choice of intervention
Article 58 (2) (i) and Article 83 (2) state that the IMY has the power to impose
administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Subject to
the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees shall be imposed
in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article 58 (2), such as:
injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account
taken into account when deciding whether to impose administrative penalty fees and at
determining the amount of the fee. In the case of a minor infringement, IMY
as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee issue one
reprimand pursuant to Article 58 (2) (b). Account shall be taken of aggravating and mitigating circumstances
circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement
as well as previous violations of relevance.
The company has stated that the reason for the complainant's request for deletion is not
was handled correctly mainly due to a mistake in the company's customer service and
customer service tools. Due to what happened, the company has stated that it has taken action
specific organizational and technical measures to strengthen their established
processes and procedures for identifying a request under the Data Protection Regulation.
In an overall assessment of the circumstances, the IMY finds that it is a question of less
infringements within the meaning of recital 148 and that Rebtel Networks AB therefore

shall be reprimanded in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation for those found
