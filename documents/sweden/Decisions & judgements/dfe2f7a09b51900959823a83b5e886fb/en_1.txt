(1973: 1173) Yellow-Belly Decision Systems AB's (org. No. 556912-4885)

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate noticed in December 2018 that the company Nusvar
AB (Nusvar) launched the website www.Mrkoll.se (Mrkoll). On the website
information was published on all persons registered in Sweden.
The Mrkoll website is covered by such a publishing certificate as regulated in 1
Cape. Section 5 of the Freedom of Expression Act. A constitutionally protected website
are not normally covered by the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). The Data Inspectorate noted, however, that it concerns some of the
registered there was information i.a. that "x has no payment remarks".
Against this background, the Data Inspectorate judged that Mrkoll can be adopted
covered by the provisions of the Credit Information Act. The Data Inspectorate
initiated against this background supervision under the Credit Information Act against
Nusvar den 18 december 2018, DI-2018-22737. It emerged in connection
thus that much of the information that Nusvar published on Mrkoll
had been obtained from Yellow-Belly Decision Systems AB (the company). The company has
not applied for the Data Inspectorate's consent to transfer or
provide its credit information register to Nusvar. The Data Inspectorate began
due to this, supervision of the company on January 9, 2019.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-298

The Data Inspectorate has obtained an opinion from the company. The Data Inspectorate has
also carried out an inspection at the company. The company has in the opinion and in
in connection with the inspection stated the following, among other things.
The company is part of the Nodeus Group AB group. The company is
personal data controller for his own credit information database. The company has
no other registers.
At the end of 2018, the company carried out a basic lift of basic data from its database
to Nusvar's database. Thereafter, the company has provided Nusvar deliveries
on any changes (incremental delivery) of basic data (name,
address, type of dwelling and, where applicable, company) every 14 days in Sweden
population over 18 years. That information is used to create the search service
Mrkoll. That delivery also includes aggregated information on income and
payment remarks. The financial information is aggregated in
cluster of at least 30 people. Financial information and information about
payment remarks are thus not disclosed at the individual level.
Aggregations are pre-prepared or pre-prepared. When the company made the clusters
the company generates a file as an excel list and Nusvar imports it into its own
database. The company does not know how Nusvar reads information that Nusvar collects
from the company's server. The company has not received an indication that Nusvar has anything
problems retrieving the data. It does not happen in real time. File transfer
between the company and Nusvar is encrypted.
According to the specification, the company discloses the following information to Nusvar;
Personal data:
For example, information on social security number, population registration date, name,
population registration address, social security number for spouse, spouse registered partner.
Household data:
For example, information on different address types such as a single-family address,
multi-family address about a tenant-owner association or other, members of the household
contains a list of ID numbers.
Board involvement:
For example, information on social security number of the board member and function
in the board.

Company name:
For example, information on social security number of board member, postcode,
post office, turnover, company status today.
Aggregations area:
Is a table produced by the company that contains social security numbers and which
area to which the person belongs.
Area data:
Based on the company's developed clusters and contains aggregations of data,
i.a. financial data including the presence of payment remarks, for
an area. The clusters consist of e.g. maximum income, average income,
minimum income, median income for residents in the area.
Clusters refer to mathematical statistics based on postal code and street code,
combined to ensure that the content of the cluster is large enough
with spreading dimensions.
The company does not consider that the company has transferred or leased its
credit information register to Nusvar. The company only delivers
cluster information and address information to Nusvar. The company believes that
the company does not transfer credit information but de facto creates another
register, which is sent to Nusvar. These are thus different registers.
The company has therefore not applied for any consent in accordance with section 13, first paragraph
the Credit Information Act.
In supervisory case DI-2018-22737, Nusvar has provided information that confirms
what the company has stated about the parties' business relationship. The cooperation agreement between
the company and Nusvar were terminated on April 8, 2019 with immediate effect.

Reason for the decision
Applicable regulations
Section 13, first paragraph, of the Credit Information Act states that registers such as
used in credit information activities may be transferred or leased to another
only with the consent of the Data Inspectorate.

Section 17 of the Credit Information Act states that in that case the person who has a permit
conducting credit reporting activities violates a provision of
the Credit Information Act, the Data Inspectorate may order him to take
correction or issue a condition. If no correction can be made on anything
otherwise the Data Inspectorate may revoke the permit. The same applies, if
the conditions for the permit in general no longer exist.
According to section 19, first paragraph 2 of the Credit Information Act, anyone who intentionally can
or by negligence violates § 13 first paragraph is sentenced to a fine or
imprisonment for a maximum of one year. Section 20 states that a credit information register can
is declared forfeited if the register has been transferred or leased in violation of section 13
the first paragraph.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the company through the basic lifting of basic data from
has transferred its credit information register to Nusvar's database
credit information register to Nusvar. The company has since leased its
credit information register to Nusvar through deliveries of updates and
information every 14 days from November 2018 to April 2019.
A certain part of the disclosure has been intended for information in clustered form.
The Data Inspectorate considers that this is irrelevant with regard to the issue of
the company's credit information register has been provided or not. All information
on natural and legal persons as a credit reporting company
treats for credit information purposes are covered by the provisions of section 13
the Credit Information Act, regardless of how the information is organized. It is not
possible to circumvent the provisions of section 13 by temporarily separating certain
credit information from a credit record and place
the information in a separate register which is then called something other than
"Credit information register". The current information is retrieved from
the credit information register even if the company processes the information in accordance with
Nusvar's wishes before it is forwarded to Nusvar. It is thus moving
not about two different registers.
The company has by transferring and lending its credit information register to
Nusvar without first obtaining the Data Inspectorate's consent acted in
in violation of section 13, first paragraph, of the Credit Information Act. The plot is that
considered serious because the Data Inspectorate would probably have refused
an application for consent if one had been made.

The Data Inspectorate has on previous occasions refused
credit reporting companies' request for consent to transfer or sublease
credit information registers for companies that provide
credit information on websites only with the support of
certificate of release. A company whose activities are covered by constitutional protection
does not need the Data Inspectorate's permission to conduct
credit reporting activities. This circumstance means that
The Data Inspectorate cannot assess whether the company's operations can be assumed to be
conducted in an expert and judicious manner. The Data Inspectorate is missing
in addition, the opportunity to decide on conditions in accordance with the Credit Information Act for
such companies. The Data Inspectorate's refusal decision has been established by a judgment in
Court of Appeal in Stockholm, Case no. 8023-08.
Revocation of permit
The company has acted in violation of section 13, first paragraph, of the Credit Information Act
by transferring and lending its credit information register to Nusvar
without the consent of the Data Inspectorate. The Data Inspectorate considers it to be one
material negligence which is irreversible and which can not be remedied by
an injunction to make a correction or by imposing a new condition
announced. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds reason to revoke the permit.

How to appeal
If you want to appeal the decision, you must write to the Data Inspectorate. Enter i
the letter which decision is being appealed and the change you are requesting.
The appeal must have been received by the Data Inspectorate no later than three weeks from
the day you received the decision. The Data Inspectorate sends the appeal
on to the Administrative Court in Stockholm for review, if the inspection does not
yourself change the decision in the way you have requested. The Chancellor of Justice also receives
appeal against the decision in the public interest. The time for
However, an appeal to the Chancellor of Justice is counted from the date of the decision
was announced.
Provided that the appeal does not contain any privacy concerns
personal information or information that may be covered by confidentiality, you can e-mail
the appeal to datainspektionen@datainspektionen.se.
