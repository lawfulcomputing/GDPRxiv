REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. With a procedural submission dated January 7, 2020, the complainant submitted that

In addition to checking the validity of the lift ticket for access control, a photo is also taken

2. With a statement dated March 6, 2020, the Respondent, represented by counsel, led

that it is correct that, for the purpose of access control, a reference photo of the

Lift ticket holder when first stepping through the equipped with a camera

Turnstile at the valley station of the Z***bergbahn I and at the valley station of the *** gondola

This access control is permissible, especially since it is only at special entry points, namely the

As a result, access control with image comparison protects those who are authorized

Lift tickets, which is why there are no violations of the GDPR or the DSG.

3. With Opinion dated April 15, 2020

led the complainant - if

relevant to the procedure - from the fact that in the best case it would require twice the financial effort,

to cover a day's skiing with hourly tickets, which is why the complainant did not

recognize proportionality. It can also be expected from the classic skier that this

spend at least one day on the slopes. The references given are only at or

shortly before passing through the relevant turnstile. Because of the big

Andrangs it is then no longer possible to decide otherwise and is not one of them

It can be assumed that no photo capture will take place at other turnstiles. Be on the trail map

not shown at which points a photo was taken. The use of the

ski area is also without the *** gondola lift as the central connection point of the ski

area impractical. The complainant denied that the access controls with

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the complainant, the object of the complaint is whether

the Respondent informed the complainant by processing his image data for the

Purpose of access control to cable car and ski lift systems in the period from 27. to

December 29, 2019 violated his basic right to secrecy according to § 1 paragraph 1 DSG

Due to the large crowds, it was not possible to turn back.

2. The complainant has for the period from December 27 to 29, 2019

Purchased ski day tickets from the Respondent for the Z***berg and the facilities of

Respondent used. On the respective day ticket has - in accordance with the

Tariff provisions of the Respondent – the indication that the ski pass is not

Tariff regulations as posted apply.

This information is shown as follows (excerpts) on the ski pass:

cannot be represented in the RIS.]

As described above, a reference photo was taken for the purpose of access control

as well as subsequently control photos of the complainant to the appropriate

turnstiles made. The reference and control photos were compared using a

of the turnstile deleted.

Assessment of evidence: The findings that the complainant is the subject

has used the facility and that the ski passes are not transferable are based on the

undisputed information provided by the complainant and the submitted photos of the ski passes

from December 27th and 28th, 2019 and the ski pass number from December 29th

2019. The findings made on the handling of the control and reference photos

based on the credibly presented statements of the Respondent.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. § 1 para. 1 DSG stipulates that everyone, in particular with regard to respect

of his private and family life, right to secrecy of those concerning him

The affected data of the complainant (photographs) are undisputed

However, the fundamental right to data protection is not absolute, but may be

According to § 1 para. 2 DSG, a restriction of the right to secrecy in

Interpretation of the right to secrecy must be taken into account in any case (cf. the

Notice of July 4, 2019, GZ: DSB-D123.652/0001-DSB/2019).

2. The complainant sometimes justified his complaint with the fact that he had no free

would have had a choice and to use the appendices of the Respondent in the

had to consent to data processing. He also explained that, as with e-mail

Registrations, an “opt-in procedure” is used. That's what he's pointing to

Complainant states that consent to data processing within the meaning of Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit

DSGVO has not occurred voluntarily or can never occur voluntarily, since the

Use of the facilities is linked to the consent. According to recital 42 of

DSGVO should only then be assumed that consent is voluntary

considered if the data subject has a genuine and free choice and is able

to refuse consent without suffering any detriment. On this subject has

However, these considerations can be left aside, especially since the Respondent

Fundamental freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data,

24 November 2011, C-468/10 and C-469/10 [ASNEF and FECEMD] para. 38) (cf. the

Data processing system essentially the same as those under the designation

"PHOTOCOMPARE - access control in connection with the use of personal (image) data

of ski lift card users” by the Data Protection Authority until the end of May 25, 2018 in

Data processing register in accordance with §§ 17 ff in conjunction with §§ 8 Para. 1 Z 4 (mainly authorized

interests), 8 Para. 3 Z 4 (performance of contract), 6 Para. 1 Z 5 and § 24 DSG 2000 registered

became.

In the course of these registrations, the existence of overriding legitimate interests

of those responsible affirmed, which is why the complainant's complaint is already settled

for this reason proves to be unfounded.

5. The details are as follows:

On the one hand, the complainant has a legitimate interest in keeping his information secret

to concede data, specifically his photograph. If the complainant submits

that sensitive personal data are affected by the image recording is dem

to counter that the processing of photographs only has a special category

of personal data if this differs from the definition of the term

"biometric data" is collected; in other words, if those with special technical

Means are processed that uniquely identify or authenticate a

Data Protection Committee, version 2.0, page 17 para. 62). A simple digital photo that like

stored here for visual comparison purposes only and displayed on a screen

without being subjected to "special technical processes" therefore does not meet any

Fact of the processing of special data categories according to Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO.

On the other hand, the Respondent has a legitimate interest in it

recognize that their contractual partners behave in accordance with the contract and are therefore in their own interest

that compliance with the tariff conditions is monitored by controls in order to

unauthorized transfer of the ski pass, which - as stated - is expressly prohibited

Complainant recognizes - are more cost-effective than hourly tickets. Is to

is to be regarded as more negligible due to the shorter period of validity than with (multiple)

day tickets. Accordingly, the complainant's argument that no

into the void. That from the

is quite suitable, an effective

to ensure access control and therefore to fulfill their purpose. Due to the

established facts that the acquisition of reference or control images only

two important hubs of the system takes place as well as the storage period only in this way

long as necessary, the measures taken turn out to be not

overly intrusive. Furthermore, the control is carried out exclusively by authorized persons

Employees, which is why the respective photographs do not have a significant group of recipients

get.

It must also be taken into account that according to recital 47 first sentence GDPR

reasonable expectations of a data subject regarding the use of their

data is to be considered as an important factor when weighing up interests

(cf. Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation Comment2 [2018] Art. 6

para. 28). It should be noted that access control systems, such as those used by the Respondent

starts, at least – like the numerous registrations mentioned above in the former

data processing register - are now not uncommon (cf. the

Considerations of the data protection authority in the decision of July 4th, 2019 already cited, GZ: DSB-

D123.652/0001-DSB/2019, number plate recognition). In addition, the complainant had

infer that the complainant had already sent an email dated December 24, 2019 - hence

before using the Respondent's facilities - inquired whether the acquisition of a

ski pass without image capture is possible. If the complainant submits that

The answer given by the Respondent's employee was incorrect, since it was obviously possible

insisted on purchasing hourly tickets for which no photographs were taken

to counter that this was not part of the complainant's request.

Apparently he had only asked about ski passes and not about hourly tickets.

6. Based on the above, the Data Protection Authority concludes that

here the legitimate interests of the respondent are those of the complainant

predominate, which is why the Respondent is right to rely on its legitimate

Interests as the basis for the lawfulness of the processing in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1

lit. f GDPR. The Respondent therefore does not have the Appellant in its

violated the right to secrecy.

It had to be decided accordingly.
