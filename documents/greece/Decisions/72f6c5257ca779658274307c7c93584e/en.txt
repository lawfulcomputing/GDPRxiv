Martsoukou. they also attended the meeting by order of the President, without
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to vote, E. I. Tsakiridou, lawyer – expert scientist, as assistant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rapporteur, who left after the debate and before the conference and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision-making, and E. Papageorgopoulou, an employee of the Department
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Administrative Affairs, as secretary.
  

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority took into account the following:
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

With no. prot. C/EI /1967/12-03-2018 document by Eurobank
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ergasias A.E. submits a treatment request against the no. 98/2017 of its Decision

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                              

Principle. specifically, the Authority with the aforementioned decision examined

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                              

those with no. prot. G/EI /1161/24-02-2015, G/EI /1163/24-02-2015, G/EI /4494/18-

 

 

 

 

 

 

07-2016, G/EI /5599/15-09-2016, G/EI /8175/12-12-2016, G/EI /1107/13-02-2017
 

 

 

 

complaints against Eurobank Ergasias A.E., which were forwarded
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Authority from the General Secretariat of Trade and Consumer Protection. The
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



2
 

complainants claimed that they were unlawfully harassed in the context of information
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors and that Eurobank Ergasias A.E. did not inform them about
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing their details to Debtors Information Companies.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, with the no. 98/2017 Decision, rejected the above complaints
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and addressed to the applicant a recommendation regarding the manner of its fulfillment
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation to inform its debtors, whose details are available at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Debtor Information Companies. In more detail, the Authority decided that henceforth
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant, as lender and controller, should proceed with a special
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual information of its debtors about the availability of their data to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each specific Debtor Information Company, to provide a reasonable
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period (e.g. indicatively, 10-15 days) before being available to exercise the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights of access and objection and to ensure that this information
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be done in any convenient way, e.g. with integration of the relevant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information on the copies of accounts and in a conspicuous place thereof or through them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic mail (email), in all cases in which this
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes possible, and especially since the relevant data has been granted to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controller from the data subjects. By the same decision
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was further clarified that the lender, as controller, must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

updates again, in accordance with the above, every time their data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his debtors are available to a different Debtor Information Company.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With the present application, Eurobank Ergasias A.E. requests its withdrawal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the contested decision, complaining that with the aforementioned decision
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were enacted, with incorrect interpretation and application of article 4 par. 4 n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3758/2009 in combination with Article 11 of Law 2472/1997, disproportionate obligations in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden of itself and the other creditors. The reasons for revocation of the offended party
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Authority's decision, as claimed by the applicant, are mainly the following:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A) Incorrect interpretation and application of article 4 par. 4 of Law 3758/2009 in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination with Article 11 of Law 2472/1997. Debtor Reporting Companies do not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are "third parties" within the meaning of article 2 paragraph i of Law 2472/1997, and therefore
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no question of application of paragraph 3 of article 11 of Law 2472/1997, but
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 1 of the same article applies, according to which it is sufficient for the bank to

inform data subjects about the recipient or the category
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipients. Likewise, the article refers to recipients or categories of recipients
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 consequently, the contested regulations are in direct conflict with it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of paragraph 1 of article 11 of law 2472/1997, given that illegitimately
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose on the applicant, as controller, the obligation to inform
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the data subjects, not only for the category of recipients
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their data (the EEOs), but precisely and each time specifically for each one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific company, to which it assigns its debtor information. According to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant, this regulation of the contested decision is based on an error
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation and application of article 4 par. 4 of Law 3758/2009, in combination with par.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 and 3 of article 11 of law 2472/1997. Not much rather, when the above method
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the provisions deviates from the observations that the Authority itself had
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit to the proposed amendments of Law 3758/2009 from 05-08-2011 (see the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with no. prot. C/EX/5417/05-08-2011 document of the Authority, in particular the comment of the Authority
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the proposed regulation of article 4 par. 5 of Law 3758/2009, according to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whereby, in view of the fact that Debtors Information Companies act as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you were performing the processing on behalf of the lenders, the Authority clarifies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that "The lender may assign the information to the company that owes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to inform the debtor of this transfer at the latest before the first
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication with him"). With the said observations, it was enough for the Authority to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of achieving the goal of adequately informing the debtor about the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

availability of his data, his updating by the Company itself
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notification of Debtors. According to the claims of the applicant, none
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely justified, the Authority, with the contested decision, deviated drastically
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from her said position, which reinforces the incorrect and unjustified
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the offending regulations. And the relevant requirements of the laws
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997 and Law 3758/2009 are fully satisfied with the updating of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors for the said category of recipients (EEO), in any convenient way
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e.g. through movements of their accounts).

 

 

 

 

 

    

B) The conditions set by the contested decision are not suitable for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debtors are duly and promptly informed about the availability of the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to Debtor Information Companies, while it has no practical difference for

the debtor the information about the name of the specific Company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Debtors' Update, given that even before the specific update they have
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility to exercise all the rights provided by Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, the increased obligation to inform the offended parties
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations, is not specifically justified in relation to current market data,
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the basis of which debtors are now fully aware of the market practice in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in relation to the assignment of debtors' information by lenders to Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notification of Debtors. The relevant publicity is fully guaranteed by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kept Register of the specific companies, which is a public book
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and is kept at the Ministry of Development in electronic form, and access to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is done free of charge (Article 7 of Law 3758/2009, see the website of the Greek Tax Agency).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C) The conditions imposed by the contested decision are unnecessary and
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disproportionate to the intended purposes, as they require the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment of sufficient human resources on the part of the lenders and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the same time the development of new systems (systemic changes), with enormous
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost for the bank, in order to produce the absolutely specific and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeated/permanent information that the Authority's decision imposes.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The applicant finally points out the high percentage of customers who, due to non
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

updated information is not possible to locate and therefore n
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informing them becomes practically impossible. It also claims that the natural
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons may have different contractual relationships with the same bank (e.g.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor, guarantor), for a multitude of products (e.g. housing, consumer,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit cards) and that the fact that banks divide debts into
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buckets and carry out continuous exchanges of EEOs with multiple criteria
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(buckets, product, etc.), makes it practically impossible to continuously update them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors from the banks for each company to which they assign it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informing the debtor. Since these products are monitored by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different addresses of the banks, it is not even possible in practice
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(systematically) to make at least one centralized update per bank for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all banking products, moreover, not even the debts are settled at the same time
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

super days. With these data, according to the claims of the applicant, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contested decision establishes a regulation of a disproportionate nature in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in relation to the intended purpose of fully informing the debtors according to

article 4 par. 4 of Law 3758/2009.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, with the no. prot. C/EX/1958/13-03-2019 call to hearing, called
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eurobank Ergasias A.E. to support her application. He also called
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Hellenic Banking Association to present its views. its meeting
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beginning on 04-02-2019 (postponed from 03-19-2019), they were legally present from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of Eurobank Ergasias A.E. Petros Frangiskos (with AM D A
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

…), Maria Hatzimina (with AM D A …) and A, […] of Operational Management
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Risk of Retail Banking Product Delays, on its part
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Hellenic Union of Banks, Ioannis Mourgelas (with AM D A ...) and ofia
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fotopoulos (with AM D A ...) and on behalf of Alpha Bank SA. (similarly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member of EET) Elina Georgili (with AM D A ...).
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsequently, Eurobank Ergasias A.E. also submitted a written memorandum (with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no. prot. G/EI /3015/22-04-2019), in which he further developed the following:
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. The obligation to provide increased/specialized information to debtors about the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making their data available to a specific information company is against it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in articles 10-12 of Directive 95/46/EC, 11 Law 2472/1997 (and the guidelines
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines on the issue of transparency of the Article 29 Working Group),
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 par. 2 of no. 1/1999 of the Regulatory Act of the Authority, of which
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is inferred that the obligation in question consists of informing in relation to them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipients or the categories of recipients, even in the event that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to exercise the right of access by requesting additional information
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the processing of his personal data. In addition, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GDPR which repeals the previous Directive 95/45/EC, apart from the above,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledges the obligation of compliance by the file controller only
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the categories of recipients to whom they are to be personally communicated
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data (see article 30 par. 1 para. d GDPR). Based on the current legislation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework, therefore, the bank informs the debtors accordingly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the application and signing of loan contracts, while at the same time on its website
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is an information form regarding the processing of personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of data, which also includes information on the provision of data to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Debtor Information Companies. The bank sent this form to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1-3 Kifisias St., 11523 Athens, Tel: 210 6475600, Fax: 210 6475628, contact@dpa.gr / www.dpa.gr

its customers by e-mail message, while a corresponding post
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was included in e-Banking, in other relevant parts of the website, as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during ATM transactions. Besides, it is impossible to update about
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the specific recipient of personal data when signing a loan
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract, as the task of informing debtors is directly intertwined with the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of time during which the latter become overdue, interval at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the recipients working with the bank may be
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from those with whom he collaborated at an earlier stage. e
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any case the data subjects may have access to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

names and in the details of the EEOs, through the special Registry of article 7 of Law.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3758/2009, while the same law (article 6 par. 2) introduces an obligation in the said
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies to inform debtors about their full details already
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the first contact with them.
  

 

 

 

 

 

2. The obligation imposed on the bank by its contested decision
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Authority, to provide the data subject with the details of the specific company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

update 10-15 days before making his data available to them,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to be able to exercise access rights and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection, is contrary to articles 11 n. 2472/1997, 2 and 5 thereof with no. 1/1999
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulatory Act of the Authority, and 13 GDPR, according to which the information
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is carried out during the data collection stage and not at a later stage,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless of the possible characterization of the information companies as third parties.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Further information is provided only in the case of processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data for a different purpose, which is not the case in this case,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since the provision of the data to the EEO constitutes processing for the same purpose,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e. the execution of the loan agreement and the collection of the debts that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

derive from it.
  

 

 

3. The obligation of the companies to wait for a reasonable period of time before the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their communication with the data subjects on the one hand contravenes article 4
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

par. 4 of Law 3758/2009, according to which the telephone communication with the EEO for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debtor is allowed to be informed after 10
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days from the day it became overdue, on the other hand it is against the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle of clarity, since it does not specify the exact time period according to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the bank must wait for, on the contrary, it defines a range of days as well

indeed indicatively, ignoring the strict regulation of the briefs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadlines within which the EEOs act.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. The obligation introduced by the contested decision contradicts the principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of proportionality, because it is neither convenient nor necessary for the service
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the intended purpose, which it exceeds. cutting the protectors
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of the European and national legislation on personal data are
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect the subject from the uncontrolled by the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing availability of his data to third parties and to be aware of them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in advance who will be the recipients of his data, so that he can judge whether
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

desires their disposition and to understand for what purpose the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of his data. However, it is common knowledge that her assignment
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication with the debtor in EEO is a standard policy of all banks, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is followed with the knowledge of the data subject, in case
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overdue debt to safeguard the interests of the financial institution
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution. The debtor has been informed of the possibility of disposing of the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of him in EEO, if he becomes overdue in the repayment of the debts
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, already from the signing of the loan agreement and subsequently repeatedly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any convenient way (updates on the movement of accounts, updates
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during a transaction, website updates, etc.). The need
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assignment by lenders (in this case banks) to EEO of the update
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the debtors for the existence of their and her overdue debts
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiation of their repayment terms, which of course presupposes the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposal of the relevant data of the debtors, has also been recognized by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislator with the issuance of Law 3758/2009. He is known to the debtor and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of processing his data (see article 3 par. 3 Law 3758/2009).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 consequently, the knowledge on the part of the debtor of the specific EEO each time, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which becomes the recipient of his personal data, lacks importance and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal consequences, because an EEO makes no difference for the debtor
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the other EEO.
  

 

 

 

The disputed measure, in so far as it obliges the bank to provide to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors a reasonable period of 10-15 days from notification to disposition
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the data, for exercising the rights of access and objection, no
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is neither convenient nor necessary. Because, right of objection at the disposal of

data in EEO cannot be validly exercised, while the right of access
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists and can be exercised at any time by the subject against him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controller from the start of the processing until its end,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a fact about which the debtor has been repeatedly informed. Besides, in n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3758/2009, further safeguards are foreseen (specific framework for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legal update of EEOs). The determination of additional deadlines for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of the above rights is manifestly unnecessary. Furthermore, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination of the obligation to wait for the above period of time from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

update until the availability of the debtors' data in EEO is too early
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intended purpose, as it leads to burdening the debtors with interest, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which run, during the above period of time, given that the debt has
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become overdue.
  

 

5. Also, the obligation to wait during the above period of time may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has incalculable consequences for their management and collectability
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of bad loans, given that a good part of the debtors do not have or do not have
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have declared an e-mail address to the bank. Also, only n
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay during the above period of time, the exact duration of which is
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unstated, it can make it difficult to collect the loan. Finally, it will
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make it impossible to transfer cases between partners
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEO, which is carried out on the basis of their evaluation on specifics
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quantitative and qualitative criteria.
  

 

 

 

6. The obligation established by the contested decision implies a huge one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizational and financial costs for the bank.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7. Finally, following the above, the applicant Bank to replace him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed with the contested act of measure, proposes the following: a) to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posted in the personal data section of its website
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

update with the following information: i) that the details of overdues are available
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors in EEO and
 

 

 

 

ii) the names of those cooperating with it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution EEO, b) to reform the messages in the periodicals
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

updates, so that the collaborating EEOs are notified and c) to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly reform the letters of delay sent by the bank to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors. The applicant also informs that she has already posted on her website
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the collaborating Debtors Information Companies and that it has taken measures

improvement of the system of notifying customers to the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above direction.
  

 

 

In addition, the Hellenic Banks Association filed the no. prot. G/EI /3029/22-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

04-2019 reminder of third party intervention in favor of Eurobank Ergasias A.E. -
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the apparent legitimate interest he has from article 1 par. 4 b' thereof
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its Statute to represent the interests of all its members - and against it
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the contested decision of the Authority (with no. 98/2017). the memo in question
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EET developed the following claims:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. The Debtors Information Companies of Law 3758/2009 are widespread as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the national as well as in the European legal order, already before the economic one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crisis, when their operation was more limited. According to the above legislation,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these are mainly public limited companies that have as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive purpose of out-of-court informing the debtors of the existence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overdue debts. The supervision of these companies belongs to the Ministry
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Development (see also Decision no. 49/2001 of the Authority) and for the legal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for their operation, their previous registration in the specialist is necessary
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Register kept in the aforementioned Ministry. Furthermore, the simultaneous assignment of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the same debt to different companies is prohibited in contrast to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its successive assignment to several companies. The obligation, then, that introduces
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the contested decision to inform customers regarding the specific one
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company that will take over their case in case of overdue debts
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not only in terms of the absolutely specific category (Government Law n. 3758/2009, see
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special Register of the Ministry of Development), is contrary to the regulatory framework
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the protection of personal data, which recognizes the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation to disclose only the categories accepted even in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of exercising the right of access (articles 10-12 of Directive 95/46/EC
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 41 of its preamble, 6 in combination with article 11 of Law 2472/1997, with no.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1/1999 Regulatory Act of the Authority, recommendation of the Authority with no.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

G/EX/4744/12.7.2013, 13-15 GKPDI).
  

 

 

2. specifically, since 1995, when Directive 95/46/EC was adopted until today
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the GDPR, the position on the content of the update is permanent,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of both the EU and the national legislator: for his information

10
 

subject for the recipients of his personal data, the reference is sufficient
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the recipient category.
  

 

 

 

3. Also, according to the above legislation, the obligation to inform is not one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuous update, but has a specific time point of fulfillment that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the stage of collecting personal data. When one is drawn up
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long-term agreement (such as a loan or credit agreement), the borrower
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is updated during the collection of its data, and an update is carried out
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and through periodical letters. However, these updates are also issued
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reports are sent, i.e. their status is reflected in them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due on the date of issue of each information note. after all,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is not possible for the bank, like any lender, to know if and when it will
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default occurs, before the actual payment date has passed.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Informing subjects about the category/s of recipients of their data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is absolutely sufficient (see relevant provisions of the Directive, Law 2472/1997 and GDPR).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After all, the exact same choices were made in the law and regarding the right
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access (see article 12 par. 2 b of Law 2472/1997, article 12 par. a of the Directive
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

96/46/EC, par. 41 of the preamble of the Directive). Even when the subject of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data requests additional information on the processing carried out
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his personal data in order to ensure in particular their accuracy
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the lawful character of their processing, the legislator again considered that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference to recipient category is sufficient. And under the strictest framework
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the GDPR, no changes have been made to the information of subjects regarding
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the recipients of their data. Even when the subject exercises the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of access to be more fully informed about its features
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of his personal data, the data controller is sufficient to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of notifying the recipients or categories of recipients, to whom
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal data has been disclosed or is about to be disclosed
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(article 15 par. 1 c) GDPR). That is, according to the Regulation, the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, even if it has already disclosed the subject's data,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and therefore their recipients can be absolutely specific, when it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to exercise the right of access it is sufficient to inform the subject about it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category or categories thereof and not necessarily for acquaintances
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific recipients. These settings are valid throughout time, were and are

11
 

completely conscious choices of the legislators that are consistent with the transactions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices and the functioning of the economy and cannot be changed by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the national legislature, directly by provision of law or indirectly by means of a mandate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement.
  

4. The purpose of protecting customers' personal data in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific case is served by clarifying the category
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted in such a way that the subject understands the scope and content
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her. and the case under consideration, the category of recipients, GEO n. 3758/2009,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is absolutely specific. It is about
 

 

 

 

for specific ones, absolutely
 

 

 

specified companies, which in order to operate must be included in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public Register, which is kept at the Ministry of Development and is accessible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from anyone.
  

 

5. The justification of the selective, significantly restrictive, application of the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

updating the relevant provisions of the law and now of the GDPR with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking that the activity of the EEOs is considered more burdensome for the debtors,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on an arbitrary criterion. In addition, the subjects in the specific
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case they have breached obligations, which they assumed, and became
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overdue, and informing them verbally, by telephone, for the purpose of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their awareness, under the guarantees of Law 3758/2009 is the mildest action
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the lender. EEOs were the first of the tools legislated for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to strengthen the arsenal in the fight to limit the underserved
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of loans and credits, which is not only ongoing, but its happy outcome is
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more urgent than ever. The exemption of the country's banking system from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excessive collateral is a condition for financing the economy
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and therefore for economic development.
  

 

 

 

 

 

6. The reasonable waiting obligation introduced by the contested act
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of time financially burdens the bank, but also the debtor,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whereas it contradicts article 4 par. 4 of Law 3758/2009. Further, as to the exercise
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the rights of the subject there is no time limit, the right does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection is exercised in this case only against the bank (which observes all
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data in relation to the debt and its evolution) and only in relation to any
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, e.g. as to the amount due. The determination of other deadlines
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the exercise of rights for the protection of personal data,

12
 

it would not only lack a legal basis, but would also create confusion mainly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the starting point of the new deadline. Since he can't
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally and factually to enforce the update for each specific EEO, instead
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the aforementioned category, the question of when would inevitably arise
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this new deadline begins, to which there is only one answer: the beginning of it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due date, i.e. the impractical passing of the due date of payment, which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubtless the lender and the debtor know. As long as this is it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious, it is equally obvious that the two terms with the same starting point
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only confusion and legal uncertainty can cause, but also to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit the effectiveness of actions for the recovery of the
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay of dues. Also, the increase of overtime workers' rights
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors at the expense of lenders but ultimately also their informed customers
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit institutions, would contradict the provisions of article 7 par. 2
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

f of the Directive, of article 5 par. 2 par. e of Law 2472/1997 and now of the article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 par. 1 f of the GDPR and therefore with the principle of proportionality.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

7. Even if it is accepted that in the regulatory powers of the Authority,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with article 19 par. 1 of Law 2472/1997, the possibility was also included
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to amend a clear provision of the law with its decision, this regulatory one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction no longer exists under the GDPR regime. Also, even
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it is accepted that it could be amended without national or Union law h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent provision of all legislation to date on its content
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information (initial and after exercising the right of access) to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direction of Decision 98/2017, this would entail extremely disproportionate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort and excessive cost (see references), so that it would
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of proportional application of the provision of sec. b' of par. 4 of article 14
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GDPR.

   

8. Finally, EET proposes the following solution to improve the information of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers: First, posting of data by each credit institution
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the EEOs with which it cooperates each time, with their full details, on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his updates to his clients (candidates and active) to refer
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on his website. Still, bearing in mind that it is unknown if and when one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor will become overdue, and despite the fact that the obligation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information is exhausted, according to EET, when it is carried out during the collection of
